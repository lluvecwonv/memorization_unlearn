Netizens criticise South Korean government officials whose sons evade conscription.

Storified by The Stream· Fri, Oct 11 2013 14:29:37

Some criticised their exemption from conscription:

Translation: It is scandalous that the son of a senior official in the Blue House's (South Korea's executive office) national planning office - not even an ordinary citizen - gave up his Korean nationality to evade military service. Either send the son to the military or give up your senior position! I wonder if he planned this?

민간인도 아니고 청와대 국정기획 수석이란 분이 아들 국적 바꿔 군대면제 한것은 정말 괘씸하다.군대를 보내던가 수석을 안하던가 해야지! 국정기획 하라니까 아들면제 기획했나?이석현

Translation: The blame should not be on the father of the person who gives up his Korean citizenship to evade military service. But if that person's father claims to be patriotic and if it is a country that loudly tells others' sons to be patriotic, then the road that country is on is fixed. A spoiled road.

누가 군대 안 가려고 대한민국 국적을 버렸다고 해서 그의 아버지를 욕할 일은 아닐 겁니다. 하지만 그런 사람의 아버지가 '애국세력'을 자처하고 남의 자식들더러 '애국'하라고 큰소리치는 나라라면, 그런 나라가 갈 길은 정해져 있습니다. 망하는 길.전우용

In the following tweet, influential South Korean citizen journalist @mediamongu listed the names of public officials whose sons reportedly gave up their citizenship. Among them is the spokesman of the prime minister and the vice president of the Bank of Korea.

한국국적을 포기하고 병역의무 면제 받은 아들을 둔 고위공직자들. 유민봉 청와대 국정기획수석, 신중돈 국무총리실 대변인, 신원섭 산림청장, 강태수 한국은행 부총재, 김우한 정부통합전산센터장, 강혜련 한국과학창의재단 이사장, 조계륭 한국무역보험공사 사장.미디어몽구

가수 고 김광석씨 부인 서해순씨가 지난 17일 용인시 기흥구 자신의 집에서 〈한겨레〉기자와 만나 인터뷰를 하고 있다.

가수 고 김광석씨의 부인 서해순씨를 둘러싼 ‘김광석씨 딸 서연양 타살 의혹’에 대해 경찰이 지난 10일 무혐의 결론을 내렸지만 여전히 많은 사람은 그에 대한 의심을 거두지 못하고 있다. 서씨는 경찰의 수사 결과 발표가 있고 일주일이 지난 17일 오전 경기 용인시 자신의 집에서 <한겨레>와 만나 2시간 동안 그간의 소회를 밝혔다.

이날 서씨는 장애가 있는 아이를 키워왔던 자신의 삶에 대해 ‘이를 악물고 견뎌낸 시간’으로 기억했다. 자신이 무너지면 딸 서연양과 함께 죽을 수밖에 없는 심정이었다는 것이다. 서씨는 이날 서연양의 평소 사진과 일기장 등을 공개하며, “서연이는 사람을 행복하게 만들어 주는 아이”였다고 회상했다. 그는 경찰 조사 과정에 서연양의 ‘현장검증’까지 치른 일을 회상하며 “이렇게까지 살아야 하나 싶었다”며 괴로움을 토로하기도 했다.

그는 이번 사태가 여성 혐오에서 비롯됐다는 박훈 변호사의 의견에 동의를 표하기도 했다. 서씨는 “남편이 죽으면 혼자된 여자에게 ‘모든 권리를 놓고 갈길 가라’고 말하는 차별적 문화”가 이 사태를 키웠다고 말했다.

서씨는 ‘끝까지 취재하겠다’는 이상호 <고발뉴스> 기자 때문에 신변의 위협을 느낀다며 경찰에 신변보호 요청을 했다고 밝혔다. 법원에는 접근금지 가처분도 신청할 계획이란다. 또 안민석 더불어민주당 의원, 추혜선 정의당 의원 등이 ‘변사사건의 공소시효를 확대하자’며 발의한 형사소송법 개정안(‘김광석법’)에 대한 불만을 드러내기도

福島の子供たちが死んでいく

Some 39 months after the multiple explosions at Fukushima, thyroid cancer rates among nearby children have skyrocketed to more than forty times (40x) normal.

福島第一原発の複数の原子炉爆発事故から３９ヶ月。周辺地域の子供たちの甲状腺がんの発生率が通常の４０倍に急上昇している。

More than 48 percent of some 375,000 young people-nearly 200,000 kids-tested by the Fukushima Medical University near the smoldering reactors now suffer from pre-cancerous thyroid abnormalities, primarily nodules and cysts. The rate is accelerating.

福島県立医科大学がおこなった調査によると、約２０万人の子供たちを含む３７万５千人の若い対象者のうち４８％以上が前がん症状の結節や嚢胞が発症し、その率はさらに増加している。

More than 120 childhood cancers have been indicated where just three would be expected, says Joseph Mangano, executive director of the Radiation and Public Health Project.

通常は3種ほどの小児がんが予想されるはずが、120種以上の小児がんが示されている、と『放射能と公衆衛生プロジェクト』の主任管理官、ジョセフ・マンガーノ氏は述べている。

The nuclear industry and its apologists continue to deny this public health tragedy. Some have actually asserted that "not one person" has been affected by Fukushima's massive radiation releases, which for some isotopes exceed Hiroshima by a factor of nearly 30.

原子力産業とその擁護者たちは、この公衆衛生上の悲劇を否定し続けている。広島原爆で放出された放射性同位元素量の３０倍を超える、福島原発からの大量の放射能放出で傷害を受けたものは「一人もいない」と断言する関係者も存在する。

But the deadly epidemic at Fukushima is consistent with impacts suffered among children near the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island and the 1986 explosion at Chernobyl, as well as findings at other commercial reactors.

2 And “fresh” can be a relative term. Before 2009, federal regulators did not require water bottlers to remove E. coli.

3 Actually, E. coli doesn’t sound so bad. In 1999 the Natural Resources Defense Council found that one brand of spring water came from a well in an industrial parking lot near a hazardous waste dump.

6 Ice is a lattice of tetra­hedrally bonded molecules that contain a lot of empty space. That’s why it floats.

7 Even after ice melts, some of those tetrahedrons almost always remain, like tiny ice cubes 100 molecules wide. So every glass of water, no matter what its temperature, comes on the rocks.

8 You can make your own water by mixing hydrogen and oxygen in a container and adding a spark. Unfortunately, that is the formula that helped destroy the Hindenburg.

9 Scientists have a less explosive recipe for extracting energy from hydrogen and oxygen. Strip away electrons from some hydrogen molecules, add oxygen molecules with too many electrons, and bingo! You get an electric current. That’s what happens in a fuel cell.

11 Hair on your skin can hold water droplets too. A hairy leg may get sunburned more quickly than a shaved one.

12 Vicious cycle: Water in the stratosphere contributes to the current warming of the earth’s atmosphere. That in turn may increase the severity of tropical cyclones, which throw more water into the stratosphere. That’s the theory, anyway.

Composition of Rocks A rock can be defined as a solid substance that occurs naturally because of the effects of three basic geological processes: magma solidification; sedimentation of weathered rock debris; and metamorphism. As a result of these processes, three main types of rock occur: Igneous Rocks - produced by solidification of molten magma from the mantle. Magma that solidifies at the Earth's surface conceives extrusive or volcanic igneous rocks. When magma cools and solidifies beneath the surface of the Earth intrusive or plutonic igneous rocks are formed. Sedimentary Rocks - formed by burial, compression, and chemical modification of deposited weathered rock debris or sediments at the Earth's surface. Metamorphic Rocks - created when existing rock is chemically or physically modified by intense heat or pressure. rocks are composed of minerals. Minerals are defined by geologists as naturally occurring inorganic solids that have a crystalline structure and a distinct chemical composition. Of course, the minerals found in the Earth's rocks are produced by a variety of different arrangements of chemical elements. A list of the eight most common elements making up the minerals found in the Earth's rocks is described in Table 10d-1.

<|begin_of_text|>The Korean language contains many words that are based on onomatopoeia, which is the sound associated with an object or action. The Korean word for onomatopoeia is heeseongeo ( 의성어), but don't worry about remembering it... it's rarely used. In fact, if you use the word with Koreans, then they might assume that you are talking about some kind of fish! So let's take a closer look at a few of them.

Note: This article contains Hangul (Korean letters). If you can't read Korean yet, download a free guide here to start reading in about 60 minutes!! 의성어),

Learning the onomatopoeic Korean words might sound like an easy way to improve your Korean ability, but it's not as easy as it might seem. This is because the sounds that Koreans associate with something can be very different from the sounds that English speakers associate with the same object or action.

Take animals, for instance. What sound does a dog make? In English, people might say "woof, woof" but in Korean, " 멍멍 (meong-meong)." Clearly these are very different. Cats, in English, go "meow, meow"; in Korean, " 야옹 (ya-ong)." Korean pigs sound, " 꿀꿀꿀 (ggul-ggul-ggul)" whereas in English, "oink-oink." Ducks in Korea go " 곽곽 (quack-quack)", and in English... well, actually that one happens to be the same.

In some cases, the Korean name of certain animals is based on the sound that they make, which makes it easier for learners of Korean to remember the names of such animals. Frogs in Korean are called 개구리 (gaeguri) and the sound that they make is " 개굴개굴 (gaegul-gaegul)" while owls are called 부엉이 (bu-ong-i) and make a " 부엉부엉 (bu-ong-bu-ong)" sound when they hoot. 개구리개굴개굴부엉이부엉부엉

On the heels of a successful close flyby of Saturn's moon Enceladus, NASA's Cassini spacecraft is returning images of Enceladus and the nearby moon Dione.

Several pictures show Enceladus backlit, with the dark outline of the moon crowned by glowing jets from the south polar region. The images show several separate jets, or sets of jets, emanating from the fissures known as "tiger stripes." Scientists will use the images to pinpoint the jet source locations on the surface and learn more about their shape and variability.

The Enceladus flyby took Cassini within about 48 kilometers (30 miles) of the moon's northern hemisphere. Cassini's fields and particles instruments worked on searching for particles that may form a tenuous atmosphere around Enceladus. They also hope to learn whether those particles may be similar to the faint oxygen- and carbon-dioxide atmosphere detected recently around Rhea, another Saturnian moon. The scientists were particularly interested in the Enceladus environment away from the jets emanating from the south polar region. Scientists also hope this flyby will help them understand the rate of micrometeoroid bombardment in the Saturn system and get at the age of Saturn's main rings.

This flyby of Enceladus, the 13th in Cassini's mission, took a similar path to the last Enceladus flyby on Nov. 30. About eight hours before the Enceladus flyby, Cassini also swung past Dione at a distance of about 100,000 kilometers (62,000 miles). During that flyby, the spacecraft snapped clear, intriguing images of the bright, fractured region known as the "wispy terrain." These features are tectonic ridges and faults formed by geologic activity on the moon sometime in the past. Scientists will now be able to measure the depth and extent of them more accurately.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C.

<|begin_of_text|>A few days ago, I wrote about one of the dumbest supposedly major controversies in a while, which was one SEVENTEEN member supposedly telling a fan that she was basically his source of income and two others saying that she was a fan of another member. I figured that would be sorta it (because I am a dumbass) since it was either: 1) Fabricated 2) A joke 3) Telling the truth. However, of course things started to snowball because the accusation had to do with disrespect from an idol to a fan.

SEVENTEEN fans ended up claiming it was fabricated because Seungkwan‘s signature looks different, but as far as I’m concerned there was nothing conclusive about that. Of course, the same applies to the accuser’s clarifications, which don’t actually prove anything either, yet people are taking her story as solid evidence for whatever reason.

As far as I see it, we’re thus basically back to the battle of narratives. Yet the reason I’m skeptical of her side of the story is that there was a recording she made with Jeonghan that was supposed to make him some kind of dickhead.

Fansite recording of Junghan

Fan: Today’s dress code…

Junghan: Stop coming here.

Fan: (2 seconds pause) Huh…? OK.. But I keep getting picked though.

Junghan: Then other fans can’t come. Stop coming.

What an asshole, right?

But the reality of that exchange was basically what I thought the Seungkwan incident was all about, which was idols joking around with fans who show up all the time.

Duvalia jp name デュバリア Biological information Based: Majini Development information Date of

creation: 2009 Created via: Type 3 Plagas Purpose: Experimental

Duvalia is a stage in the life of the Type 3 Plaga, a genetically modified species of Plaga engineered by Tricell. Its name is derived from the Duvalia, a species of carrion flower found in tropical Africa. Its most recognizable feature is a large bulb found inside five shorter appendages, which the Plaga mimics with its armored shell and vulnerable core.[1][excerpt 1]

History

The Type 3 Plagas were being experimented on in humans from Summer 2008, with research taking place on the Ndipaya tribesmen who became known as Marshland Majini. By 2009 the guards working on Excella Gionne's cargo ship were also implanted with this Plaga type.

Overall, Duvalia are more commonly seen in Base Majini.

\”Attempts to calculate the Hoyle state have been unsuccessful since 1954,\” said Professor Dr. Ulf-G. Meißner (Helmholtz-Institut für Strahlen- und Kernphysik der Universität Bonn). \”But now, we have done it!\” The Hoyle state is an energy-rich form of the carbon nucleus. It is the mountain pass over which all roads from one valley to the next lead: From the three nuclei of helium gas to the much larger carbon nucleus. This fusion reaction takes place in the hot interior of heavy stars. If the Hoyle state did not exist, only very little carbon or other higher elements such as oxygen, nitrogen and iron could have formed. Without this type of carbon nucleus, life probably also would not have been possible.

The search for the \”slave transmitter\”

The Hoyle state had been verified by experiments as early as 1954, but calculating it always failed. For this form of carbon consists of only three, very loosely linked helium nuclei – more of a cloudy diffuse carbon nucleus. And it does not occur individually, only together with other forms of carbon. \”This is as if you wanted to analyze a radio signal whose main transmitter and several slave transmitters are interfering with each other,\” explained Prof. Dr. Evgeny Epelbaum (Institute of Theoretical Physics II at Ruhr-Universität Bochum). The main transmitter is the stable carbon nucleus from which humans – among others – are made. \”But we are interested in one of the unstable, energy-rich carbon nuclei; so we have to separate the weaker radio transmitter somehow from the dominant signal by means of a noise filter.\”

What made this possible was a new, improved calculating approach the researchers used that allowed calculating the forces between several nuclear particles more precisely than ever. And in JUGENE, the supercomputer at Forschungszentrum Jülich, a suitable tool was found. It took JUGENE almost a week of calculating. The results matched the experimental data so well that the researchers can be certain that they have indeed calculated the Hoyle state.

The term is Japanese slang for companies with long hours, dreadful working conditions and miserable pay that exploit their employees beyond the legal limit — last-ditch options for those who can't get better work. The company in the movie, though, was not the kind you might associate with such a backward, sweatshop-like workplace. It was an IT company.

Not surprisingly, young Japanese are none too keen [2] to work in such coding sweatshops, which are all too real (the movie itself is based on a true story [3], and a not uncommon one). It doesn't help that programmers are associated in the public eye with social ineptness [4], and that the programming task itself is often viewed as grunt work, or not understood at all [5] [ja]. Young Japanese are steadily fleeing the industry, and the exodus is one of the main reasons why Japan is losing its competitiveness in the new digital age [6].

A new analysis of the largest known deposit of carbonate minerals on Mars suggests that the original Martian atmosphere may have already lost most of its carbon dioxide by the era of valley network formation.

"The biggest carbonate deposit on Mars has, at most, twice as much carbon in it as the current Mars atmosphere," said Bethany Ehlmann of the California Institute of Technology and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, both in Pasadena. "Even if you combined all known carbon reservoirs together, it is still nowhere near enough to sequester the thick atmosphere that has been proposed for the time when there were rivers flowing on the Martian surface."

Carbon dioxide makes up most of the Martian atmosphere. That gas can be pulled out of the air and sequestered or pulled into the ground by chemical reactions with rocks to form carbonate minerals. Years before the series of successful Mars missions, many scientists expected to find large Martian deposits of carbonates holding much of the carbon from the planet's original atmosphere. Instead, these missions have found low concentrations of carbonate distributed widely, and only a few concentrated deposits. By far the largest known carbonate-rich deposit on Mars covers an area at least the size of Delaware, and maybe as large as Arizona, in a region called Nili Fossae.

Christopher Edwards, a former Caltech researcher now with the U.S. Geological Survey in Flagstaff, Arizona, and Ehlmann reported the findings and analysis in a paper posted online by the journal Geology. Their estimate of how much carbon is locked into the Nili Fossae carbonate deposit uses observations from numerous Mars missions, including the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) on NASA's Mars Global Surveyor orbiter, the mineral-mapping Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) and two telescopic cameras on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) on NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter.

Edwards and Ehlmann compare their tally of sequestered carbon at Nili Fossae to what would be needed to account for an early Mars atmosphere dense enough to sustain surface waters during the period when flowing rivers left their mark by cutting extensive river-valley networks. By their estimate, it would require more than 35 carbonate deposits the size of the one examined at Nili Fossae. They deem it unlikely that so many large deposits have been overlooked

Boron nitride has made news repeatedly in recent years as a material with an appealing mix of structural and physical properties. But it hasn’t made news as a catalyst, and certainly not one with the potential to drive global-scale industrial chemical processes.

That all just changed. Researchers have demonstrated that boron nitride (BN) selectively catalyzes conversion of propane to propene, a valuable chemical used worldwide on the multimillion-ton-per-year scale (Science 2016, DOI: 10.1126/science.aaf7885).

Researchers have mainly studied nanotube and one-atom-thick forms of BN that boast high strength, heat resistance, and unique electronic properties. A team at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, including Joseph T. Grant and Ive Hermans, have shown that BN unexpectedly works well as a catalyst that drives oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). This process strips hydrogen from propane to form propene and oxidizes the hydrogen to form water.

Manufacturers typically produce propene by “cracking” large hydrocarbons in naphtha, a component of crude oil, with steam. But steam cracking plants have started to use shale gas instead of naphtha as a feedstock, a process that yields less propene. This has forced manufacturers to look for alternative ways to boost propene output.

Several dehydrogenation methods that do not use an oxidizer can drive the propane-to-propene reaction. But these methods gunk up the catalysts, shortening their lifetimes. Also, nonoxidative dehydrogenation and steam cracking are both highly endothermic, and therefore energy intensive.

In contrast, ODHP is exothermic and can run efficiently at hundreds of degrees lower than the other processes. According to industry estimates, a reaction running at relatively low temperatures such as these could reduce energy input by 45%. But the many ODHP catalysts that have been studied overoxidize propene, forming unwanted yet thermodynamically stable CO and CO 2.

Not BN. The Wisconsin team finds that in the presence of oxygen, BN nanotubes and hexagonal-BN convert propane to propene and generate ethene, a valuable commodity, as the main by-product. Under one set of conditions, the reaction generated roughly 80% propene and 12

<|begin_of_text|>There may be enough oxygen in the waters of Jupiter's moon Europa to support millions of tons worth of fish, according to a new study. And while nobody is suggesting there might actually be fish on Europa, this finding suggests the Jovian satellite could be capable of supporting the kinds of life familiar to us here on Earth, if only in microbial form.

Europa, which is roughly the size of Earth's moon, is enveloped by a global ocean about 100 miles deep (160 km), with an icy crust that may be only a few miles thick. From what we know of Earth, where there is water, there is a chance at life, so for many years scientists have speculated that this Jovian moon could support extraterrestrials.

As we learned more about Jupiter's effect on its moons, the possibility for life on Europa grew even more likely. Studies showed the moon could have enough oxygen to support the kind of life we are most familiar with on Earth.

IN PICTURES: Jupiter

The ice on the surface, like all water, is made from hydrogen and oxygen, and the constant stream of radiation pouring in from Jupiter reacts with this ice to form free oxygen and other oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide. The reactivity of oxygen is key to generating the energy that helped multi-cellular life flourish on our planet.

Still, researchers had thought there was no effective method for delivering any of this oxygen-rich matter into Europa's ocean. Scientists had assumed the primary way for surface materials to migrate downward was from the impacts it would suffer from cosmic debris, which regularly bombards everything in our solar system. [Photos of Jupiter's moons.]

However, past calculations suggested that even after a few billion years, such "impact gardening" would never lead to an oxygenated layer more than some 33 feet (10 meters) deep into the ice shell, nowhere far enough down to reach the underlying ocean.

However, the new study suggests this oxygen-rich layer could be far thicker than before thought, potentially encompassing the entire crust. The key is looking at other ways to stir Europa's crust, explained researcher Richard Greenberg, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at Tucson.

The gravitational pull Europa experiences from Jupiter leads to tidal forces roughly 1,000 times stronger than what Earth feels from our moon, flexing and heating Europa and making it very active geologically. This could explain why its surface appears no older than 50 million years old — its surface underwent complete turnover in that time

Oxygen toxicity Synonyms Oxygen toxicity syndrome, oxygen intoxication, oxygen poisoning In 1942–43 the UK Government carried out extensive testing for oxygen toxicity in divers. The chamber is pressurised with air to 3.7 bar. The subject in the centre is breathing 100% oxygen from a mask. Specialty Emergency medicine

Oxygen toxicity is a condition resulting from the harmful effects of breathing molecular oxygen (O

2 ) at increased partial pressures. Severe cases can result in cell damage and death, with effects most often seen in the central nervous system, lungs, and eyes. Historically, the central nervous system condition was called the Paul Bert effect, and the pulmonary condition the Lorrain Smith effect, after the researchers who pioneered the discoveries and descriptions in the late 19th century. Oxygen toxicity is a concern for underwater divers, those on high concentrations of supplemental oxygen (particularly premature babies), and those undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

The result of breathing increased partial pressures of oxygen is hyperoxia, an excess of oxygen in body tissues. The body is affected in different ways depending on the type of exposure. Central nervous system toxicity is caused by short exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure. Pulmonary and ocular toxicity result from longer exposure to increased oxygen levels at normal pressure. Symptoms may include disorientation, breathing problems, and vision changes such as myopia. Prolonged exposure to above-normal oxygen partial pressures, or shorter exposures to very high partial pressures, can cause oxidative damage to cell membranes, collapse of the alveoli in the lungs, retinal detachment, and seizures. Oxygen toxicity is managed by reducing the exposure to increased oxygen levels. Studies show that, in the long term, a robust recovery from most types of oxygen toxicity is possible.

Protocols for avoidance of the effects of hyperoxia exist in fields where oxygen is breathed at higher-than-normal partial pressures, including underwater diving using compressed breathing gases, hyperbaric medicine, neonatal care and human spaceflight. These protocols have resulted in the increasing rarity of seizures due to oxygen toxicity, with pulmonary and ocular damage being mainly confined to the problems of managing premature infants.

In recent years, oxygen has become available for recreational use in oxygen bars. The US Food and Drug Administration has warned those suffering from problems such as heart or lung disease not to use oxygen bars. Scuba divers use breathing gases containing up to 100% oxygen, and should have specific

<|begin_of_text|>Oxygen on a planet might be a sign of life, but in two peculiar white dwarf stars it could indicate a narrow escape from a violent death. Their oxygen content marks them as failed stellar bombs – the remnants of stars that almost went supernova.

The new stars are among thousands of white dwarfs picked up by the Sloane Digital Sky Survey. Like all white dwarfs they are the dead, cooling cores left behind by mainstream stars, and are mainly made of helium. Usually the second most plentiful ingredient is carbon – but when a group of astronomers led by Boris Gänsicke at the University of Warwick, UK, analysed the spectrum of light from these two white dwarfs, they found that the objects hold far more oxygen than carbon.

“It’s extreme – these things look very different from any white dwarfs we’ve seen before,” says team member Danny Steeghs.

Creating so much oxygen requires a nuclear furnace fiercer than that needed for a carbon-rich mixture, so the stars that spawned these white dwarfs must have been hot and massive. Simulations suggest that they must have been almost too big to end their days gently – any larger, and they would have grown a core so massive and dense that it would inevitably have collapsed, releasing enough energy to blow the rest of the star apart in a supernova explosion.

The critical mass needed to create such a supernova is thought to be between 7 and 10 times that of the sun. These almost-bombs might help astrophysicists to pin down the threshold more precisely, and Gänsicke hopes to use the Very Large Telescope in Chile’s Atacama Desert to get a clearer spectrum and reveal their chemistry in more detail. “It will give the theoreticians something to work with,” he says.

Perhaps most interestingly, researchers say, it is the elevated oxidation of pyrite, popularly known as “fool’s gold,” in the glacial breakdown that produces increased acidity and leads to CO 2 escaping to the atmosphere from rivers and the oceans.

“CO 2 has gone up and down repeatedly over time, and we don’t really know why. Our study suggests that this process may play a meaningful role,” said Joshua West, professor of earth sciences and environmental studies at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the study’s corresponding author.

This means that, over very long earth cycles, nature is self-regulating against future runaway glaciation.

Graduate researcher Mark Torres of USC Dornsife’s Department of Earth Sciences served as the study’s lead author, which published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.

The fool’s gold standard

As oxidized pyrite slowly makes its way from glaciated water to the ocean, it creates an increase in CO 2 in the atmosphere.

We found glacial rivers are rich in dissolved sulfur, and when they’re rich in sulfur, we have found that this tends to be because of the weathering of pyrite or fool’s gold. Mark Torres

“We found glacial rivers are rich in dissolved sulfur, and when they’re rich in sulfur, we have found that this tends to be because of the weathering of pyrite or fool’s gold,” Torres said. “When these kinds of rivers flow into the ocean, the sulfur causes the transfer of carbon that was previously stored in rocks and the ocean back into the atmosphere.”

To measure the amount of carbon released by glacial weathering, Torres, West and the rest of the team analyzed a large database of 7,700 river glacier drainage samples.

The database was made up of a variety of samples collected from all over the world: Argentina, Canada, Greenland, Nepal, Iceland and the United States, among others. Included in the database were earlier field samples that had been collected by West and study co-author Jens Hartmann of the University of Hamburg.

The glacial river samples consistently demonstrated a lower alkalinity-to-carbon ratio than other river samples, which is indicative of pyrite weathering and carbon dioxide release

Virtual reality (VR) headsets such as the Oculus Rift will line store shelves this holiday season, and UC San Diego alumni startup Nanome, Inc. plans to capitalize on that by creating VR apps for the consumer market, the classroom, and beyond.

Nanome co-founder Steven McCloskey was part of the first graduating class of NanoEngineering at UC San Diego when he received his bachelor’s degree in 2015. Frustrated by the lack of tools available to nanoengineers for complex 3D modeling and simulation at the nanoscale, he set out to try and rectify the problem. He and colleagues built the first molecular visualization, modeling and simulation tool for today’s VR platforms called nano-one. The application allows users to build molecules with carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen atoms.

“Our goal is to provide the tools necessary to help people build new proteins and molecules and eventually also simulate their interactions,” said McCloskey. “You can see how the world works at this fundamental level, and re-make it.”

Why VR? Everything is made out of atoms—cosmetics, computer hardware, everything. Take a chair, for example. A chair can’t just look like a chair, it has to act like one. If you’re going to be manipulating things in 3D, you also need to be able to change the material properties of an object, which is dictated by structures at the nanoscale level.

McCloskey said he believes nanoscale virtual reality represents the future of engineering.

“UC San Diego is where this has to happen—we have a NanoEngineering department, VR experts, Protein Databank, interdisciplinary researchers, and we’re located in Biotech Beach,” he said.

Nano-one is now being tested in the UC San Diego Chemistry Department and in the consumer market for workflow integration, modeling precision, and optimal pattern-recognition and discovery.

As nano-one was being developed, McCloskey and his colleagues had an idea for another VR tool that would help engineers with math.

<|begin_of_text|>One of the oldest questions on earth is how all this crazy life started. Where did you come from? How about your office plant, or your cat? For a long time, our only working idea was that gods from the heavens had provided the seed of life. We may, at least, have been looking into the correct direction: researchers at UC Berkeley recently added evidence to the idea that life on Earth came from a comet.

The idea goes like this: the so-called “building blocks of life” on this planet are called dipeptides. And the real mystery is where these dipeptides came from. The Berkeley scientists’ research suggests that dipeptides could have formed on interplanetary dust and been carried down to earth on a comet. Berkeley writes:

Chemists from the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Hawaii, Manoa, showed that conditions in space are capable of creating complex dipeptides – linked pairs of amino acids – that are essential building blocks shared by all living things. The discovery opens the door to the possibility that these molecules were brought to Earth aboard a comet or possibly meteorites, catalyzing the formation of proteins (polypeptides), enzymes and even more complex molecules, such as sugars, that are necessary for life.

Or, in the paper itself, the authors put it this way:

Our results indicate that the radiation-induced, non-enzymatic formation of proteinogenic dipeptides in interstellar ice analogs is facile. Once synthesized and incorporated into the ”building material” of solar systems, biomolecules at least as complex as dipeptides could have been delivered to habitable planets such as early Earth by meteorites and comets, thus seeding the beginning of life as we know it.

They figured this out by making a mini-comet in the lab. Combining carbon dioxide, ammonia and other chemicals like methane at super cold temperatures (space is pretty cold), they created a tiny comet-like thing. Then they added the lab equivalent of cosmic rays, zapping the mini-comet with electrons. What they saw was that the combination of these high energy electrons and the comet they had built created organic molecules like amino acids and dipeptides.

The idea is that this reaction happened on its own in space, and those dipeptides were carried down to earth on that icy comet. In other words, the necessary blocks of life might really have descended to Earth from the sky.

<|begin_of_text|>Perchloric acid is a mineral acid with the formula HClO 4. Usually found as an aqueous solution, this colorless compound is a stronger acid than sulfuric acid and nitric acid. It is a powerful oxidizer when hot, but aqueous solutions up to approximately 70% by weight at room temperature are generally safe, only showing strong acid features and no oxidizing properties. Perchloric acid is useful for preparing perchlorate salts, especially ammonium perchlorate, an important rocket fuel component. Perchloric acid is dangerously corrosive and readily forms potentially explosive mixtures.

Production [ edit ]

Perchloric acid is produced industrially by two routes. The traditional method exploits the high aqueous solubility of sodium perchlorate (209 g/100 mL of water at room temperature). Treatment of such solutions with hydrochloric acid gives perchloric acid, precipitating solid sodium chloride:

NaClO 4 + HCl → NaCl + HClO 4

The concentrated acid can be purified by distillation. The alternative route, which is more direct and avoids salts, entails anodic oxidation of aqueous chlorine at a platinum electrode.[5][6]

Laboratory preparations [ edit ]

Treatment of barium perchlorate with sulfuric acid precipitates barium sulfate, leaving perchloric acid. It can also be made by mixing nitric acid with ammonium perchlorate and boiling while adding hydrochloric acid. The reaction gives nitrous oxide and perchloric acid due to a concurrent reaction involving the ammonium ion and can be concentrated and purified significantly by boiling off the remaining nitric and hydrochloric acids.

Properties [ edit ]

Anhydrous perchloric acid is an unstable oily liquid at room temperature. It forms at least five hydrates, several of which have been characterized crystallographically. These solids consist of the perchlorate anion linked via hydrogen bonds to H 2 O and H 3 O+ centers[7] Perchloric acid forms an azeotrope with water, consisting of about 72.5% perchloric acid. This form of the acid is stable indefinitely and is commercially available. Such solutions are hygroscopic. Thus, if left open to the air, concentrated perchloric acid dilutes itself by absorbing water from the air.

Dehydration of perchloric acid gives the anhydride dichlorine heptoxide:[8]

18O is a rare isotope of oxygen. The ratio of 18O to the normal 16O in foraminifera fossils (“forams”) can be used to estimate paleo-ocean temperatures. Higher values mean lower temperatures. A recent article on geologypage.com (here) led me to Bernard, et al., 2017, which has experimental data that suggest 18O concentrations can be altered in fossils by solid-state diffusion after fossilization. This can corrupt the measurement and the resulting calculated temperature. According to Bernard and colleagues, the 18O concentration alteration is visually imperceptible, so one cannot tell the fossil has been altered by visual inspection. If their results are valid, how will this impact our view of climate history?

Fractionation of 18O and 16O takes place during evaporation and precipitation, so another problem for this paleothermometer is glacier and polar ice, which delay the return of excess 16O in water vapor to the ocean. Correlations of δ18O to temperature are for an ice-free Earth, the formation of polar ice caps and mountain glaciers have an additional effect on δ18O. In figure 1, the δ18O record and the δ13C record are shown for the Cenozoic (65 million years ago to the present day).

Figure 1 (source: Zachos, et al., 2001)

The red temperature scale at the bottom of figure 1 is only applicable when there is no significant permanent polar ice, Zachos, et al. call this the ice-free temperature. It is applicable prior to about 33 million years ago when Antarctica and the North Pole were ice-free, at least in their respective summer months. Once permanent ice caps appear, they remove 16O from the oceans indefinitely and lead to a large positive δ18O in the oceans and in forams. Both records shown in figure 1 are for global deep-sea pelagic fossils, water depths greater than 1,000 meters.

In the experiments, Bernard, et al. exposed foraminifera tests (shells) to elevated pressures and temperatures when submersed in pure H 2 18O. The forams were then monitored with a micro-mass spectrometer and they observed oxygen-isotope changes. They then attempted to model the isotope diffusion process during sediment burial. Their models suggest that on a time scale of tens of millions of years, the isotopic diffusion could cause ice-free δ18

At step 1, from the collochemistry, the metal oxide such as Fe 2 O 3, TiO 2 and SnO 2 colloid was positively charged; the GO was negatively charged because GO has many oxygen containing functional groups on the surface35. The GO and SnO 2 nanoparticles were attracted by the electrostatic force so that the SnO 2 nanoparticles can distribute on the surface of GO and not departure by the ultrasonication and stir. At step 2, L-ascorbyl acid was used to reduce oxygen containing functional groups (e.g. carboxyl) on the surface GO, producing in situ reduced GO (rGO). rGO has smaller solubility in water than GO because the reduction of polar oxygen containing functional groups makes GO less hydrophilic. So, as GO sheet began to turn into the rGO, the delocalized π-bond’s conjugative effect would be increased and enlarged. The freshly formed rGO sheets would stack on other rGO sheets as a result of the π–π stacking interactions and self-assembled into a 3D structure. After the chemical reaction and at step 3, there are still many oxygen containing functional groups left on rGO sheets, thus, the SnO 2 nanoparticles with polar surfaces would interact with those functional groups via hydrogen bonding. By annealing at 550 °C, the hydrogen bonds may turn into oxygen bridges between SnO 2 and rGO, forming Sn-O-C bonds. Therefore, the SnO 2 nanoparticles are anchored strongly on the graphene surface through a C-O-Sn bridge, which facilitates the electron transfer and improve the electrode stability. Finally, we obtain a porous ASGF with relative density of ~19 mg cm−3.

Boiling water

The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the pressure surrounding the liquid[1][2] and the liquid changes into a vapor.

The boiling point of a liquid varies depending upon the surrounding environmental pressure. A liquid in a partial vacuum has a lower boiling point than when that liquid is at atmospheric pressure. A liquid at high pressure has a higher boiling point than when that liquid is at atmospheric pressure. For example, water boils at 100 °C (212 °F) at sea level, but at 93.4 °C (200.1 °F) at 1,905 metres (6,250 ft) [3] altitude. For a given pressure, different liquids will boil at different temperatures.

The normal boiling point (also called the atmospheric boiling point or the atmospheric pressure boiling point) of a liquid is the special case in which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the defined atmospheric pressure at sea level, 1 atmosphere.[4][5] At that temperature, the vapor pressure of the liquid becomes sufficient to overcome atmospheric pressure and allow bubbles of vapor to form inside the bulk of the liquid. The standard boiling point has been defined by IUPAC since 1982 as the temperature at which boiling occurs under a pressure of 1 bar.[6]

The heat of vaporization is the energy required to transform a given quantity (a mol, kg, pound, etc.) of a substance from a liquid into a gas at a given pressure (often atmospheric pressure).

Liquids may change to a vapor at temperatures below their boiling points through the process of evaporation. Evaporation is a surface phenomenon in which molecules located near the liquid's edge, not contained by enough liquid pressure on that side, escape into the surroundings as vapor. On the other hand, boiling is a process in which molecules anywhere in the liquid escape, resulting in the formation of vapor bubbles within the liquid.

Saturation temperature and pressure [ edit ]

Demonstration of the lower boiling point of water at lower pressure, achieved by using a vacuum pump

A saturated liquid contains as much thermal energy as it can without boiling (or conversely a saturated vapor contains as little thermal energy as it can without condensing).

Saturation temperature means boiling point. The saturation temperature is the temperature for a corresponding saturation pressure at which a liquid boils into its vapor phase. The liquid can be said

The dish, one of the most common Korean foods made from dog meat, has a long history in Korean culture, but has in recent years been criticized both inside and outside Korea by people with a food taboo on dog meat.

History [ edit ]

The consumption of dog meat can be traced back to antiquity. Dog bones were excavated in a neolithic settlement in Changnyeong (창녕), South Gyeongsang Province. A wall painting in the Goguryeo tombs complex (고구려 고분군; 高句麗 古墳群) in South Hwanghae Province, a UNESCO World Heritage site which dates from 4th century AD, depicts a slaughtered dog in a storehouse (Ahn, 2000).[4]

Approximately in 1816, Jeong Hak Yu (정학유; 丁學遊), the second son of Jeong Yak-yong (정약용; 丁若鏞), a prominent politician and scholar of Choseon dynasty at the time, wrote a poem called Nongawollyeonga (농가월령가; 農家月令歌). This poem, an important source of Korean folk history, describes what ordinary Korean farmer families did in each month of a year. In the description of August, the poem tells of a married woman visiting her birth parents with boiled dog meat, rice cake, and rice wine, thus showing the popularity of dog meat at the time (Ahn, 2000; Seo, 2002).

It is hard to imagine you could reconstruct a record of fog dating back thousands of years, but this is exactly what Chilean scientists have done.

The low-lying cloud is seemingly so transient and intangible, and unlike rivers and glaciers it leaves no easy-to-read impressions on the landscape.

And yet, a Santiago team has been able to trace the fog history of the Atacama Desert by studying Tillandsia plants.

Their chemistry suggests strongly that this local fog has increased over time.

It is a period covering the last 3,500 years.

"I don't think there's any other place in the world where I've actually seen a record of fog, even spanning the last hundred years," said Claudio Latorre Hidalgo from the Catholic University of Chile.

"What little we know about fog is from measurement instrumental data that we have, and from satellite data that only spans the last 20 years.

"So, this is actually a unique opportunity to study the evolution of a fog ecosystem over the Late Holocene, and what are the major drivers and controls of the mechanisms that produce that fog in the long term - the very long term."

The palaeoclimate expert was discussing his team's research here at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union - the world's largest annual gathering of Earth scientists.

The Atacama is famous for its super-arid conditions; there are places where it has not rained for years.

But life can eke out an existence if it can exploit the fog that rolls in off the Pacific. Tillandsia are a perfectly adapted opportunist.

These wiry, grey plants have no roots. They clutch weakly at sand dunes, but arrange themselves at every spatial scale to maximise their capture of the fog.

They derive everything they need from the damp air - not simply the must-have water, but also all the chemical nutrients required to underpin their biology.

Dr Latorre Hidalgo and colleagues have dug deep into the dunes to uncover a multi-millennia succession of Tillandsia; and they have described a pronounced trend: the younger the plants, the more of the lighter type, or isotope, of nitrogen atom that they have incorporated into their tissues.

An explosion last month that caused a University of Hawaii, Manoa, postdoctoral researcher to lose an arm was caused by a spark from a digital pressure gauge that was not designed for use with flammable gases, says a Honolulu Fire Department investigation report.

Thea Ekins-Coward was combining hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and oxygen gases from high-pressure cylinders into a lower pressure tank when the incident occurred. She has not given the university permission to release information about her condition, said spokesman Daniel Meisenzahl at an April 18 press conference.

The gas mixture was “food” for bacteria being used to produce biofuels and bioplastics. Ekins-Coward was working for the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute under researcher Jian Yu. A 2013 paper by Yu indicates a set-up in which gases are plumbed through a mixing device called a gas proportioner directly into the bioreactor (Int. J. Hydrogen Energy 2013, DOI: 10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.04.153). The gas gauge identified in the paper is an “intrinsically safe” model designed to prevent ignition.

But after Ekins-Coward started in the lab last fall, she purchased a 49-L steel gas tank, a different gauge not rated as intrinsically safe, a pressure-relief valve, and fittings, and she put them together, Yu and Ekins-Coward told fire department investigators, according to the report. Ekins-Coward would add the gases to the portable tank, which would then be connected to the bioreactor. She was using a mixture of 70% hydrogen, 25% oxygen, and 5% carbon dioxide for her experiments, the report says.

In the week before the incident, a similar set-up with a 3.8-L tank resulted in a “small internal explosion” when Ekins-Coward pressed the off button on the gauge, the fire department report says. She also occasionally experienced static shocks when touching the tank, which was not grounded. She reported the shocks and possibly the small explosion to Yu, who told her not to worry about it, the report says.

On the day of the incident, the 49-L tank exploded when Ekins-Coward pressed the off button on the gauge. “She did not lose consciousness or hit her head; she was aware that she lost her arm in the explosion,” the report

<|begin_of_text|>As we know from our history books, the War for Independence began with the shots fired at Lexington and Concord. Those shots required gunpowder, a substance that was in short supply throughout the colonies. In 1775 there was only one American gunpowder mill, the Frankford Mill in Pennsylvania, and it was turning out a miniscule amount compared to what would be needed to wage a successful war.[1] In addition, this mill was not turning out the high-quality powder needed for artillery use. If the Patriots were going to have any chance of victory, the colonies needed to step up production or import it. Had it not been for the French assistance in supplying the Americans with gunpowder from 1776 throughout the war, American forces would not have been able to fight and win the battles that they did.

Gunpowder is a mixture of sulfur, charcoal, and potassium nitrate that must be combined in specific ratios. While this sounds simple enough, it must be remembered that in 1775 the state of chemistry was rudimentary. Potassium nitrate itself is a compound of nitrogen and potassium, neither element of which had been identified at that point in time.[2] What they did know was that what they called “nitre” was needed, which, in some recipes, involved soaking soil in urine from both animals and humans, and then allowing it to dry. The dried urine-soil was then boiled to produce saltpeter. Not all recipes agreed with this method which added to the problems in making gunpowder. Unfortunately this required half a year or more to produce nitre-bearing soil and created a bottleneck in the production of gunpowder in America.

When the War for Independence started American supplies of powder were what they had gathered from Royal sources or their own local supplies. The amount was not enough to sustain an army in the field. While Congress was hopeful that they could establish enough mills to create their own self-sustaining sources of gunpowder, they also decided to seek additional supplies from overseas which meant European suppliers. The Journals of the Continental Congress are full of references to purchasing gunpowder in the West Indies. To do so meant selling American goods which involved adjusting the rules under the Association agreement of 1774. As several congressional delegates noted, gunpowder was needed or else the whole enterprise was lost. A Secret Committee was set up on September 19, 1775 to contract and agree to importation of gunpowder not to exceed 500 tons.[3]

What's in a name? For the Greek god of the sun, Helios.

Say what? Helium is pronounced as HEE-lee-em.

History and Uses:

Helium, the second most abundant element in the universe, was discovered on the sun before it was found on the earth. Pierre-Jules-César Janssen, a French astronomer, noticed a yellow line in the sun's spectrum while studying a total solar eclipse in 1868. Sir Norman Lockyer, an English astronomer, realized that this line, with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometers, could not be produced by any element known at the time. It was hypothesized that a new element on the sun was responsible for this mysterious yellow emission. This unknown element was named helium by Lockyer.

The hunt to find helium on earth ended in 1895. Sir William Ramsay, a Scottish chemist, conducted an experiment with a mineral containing uranium called clevite. He exposed the clevite to mineral acids and collected the gases that were produced. He then sent a sample of these gases to two scientists, Lockyer and Sir William Crookes, who were able to identify the helium within it. Two Swedish chemists, Nils Langlet and Per Theodor Cleve, independently found helium in clevite at about the same time as Ramsay.

Helium makes up about 0.0005% of the earth's atmosphere. This trace amount of helium is not gravitationally bound to the earth and is constantly lost to space. The earth's atmospheric helium is replaced by the decay of radioactive elements in the earth's crust. Alpha decay, one type of radioactive decay, produces particles called alpha particles. An alpha particle can become a helium atom once it captures two electrons from its surroundings. This newly formed helium can eventually work its way to the atmosphere through cracks in the crust.

For the purposes of this article, iodine refers both to iodide (one atom) and iodine (a compound of two iodide atoms).

Iodine Deficiency and Excess

Iodine is needed for healthy thyroid function which regulates metabolism. Both too little—and too much—iodine can result in abnormal thyroid metabolism.

A goiter (enlarged thyroid gland) can be caused by eating both too little or too much iodine. The symptoms of either can be hypothyroidism—in which metabolism slows and weight and cholesterol increases—or hyperthyroidism—where metabolism increases resulting in weight loss.

An iodine deficiency can inhibit brain development in a fetus, so vegan women should ensure a reliable source of iodine.

There may be a connection between excess iodine and acne (1, 2), although amounts up to 1,000 µg are considered safe for the majority of population (3).

Iodine Antagonists

There are components in soy, flax seeds, and raw cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and cabbage) that counteract iodine. These components, called goitrogens, cause an enlarged thyroid gland, also called a goiter. Thus, large amounts of soy combined with inadequate iodine intake can exacerbate iodine deficiency.

Iodine Sources

Iodine is consistently found in only a few foods such as dairy products (iodine solutions are used to clean the cows’ teats and dairy equipment and end up in the milk) and seafood (including seaweed).

In plant foods, iodine is found inconsistently and depends on the iodine content of the soil—food grown near the ocean tends to be higher in iodine. Commercial plant milks, including those based on soy, almonds, rice, coconuts, pistachios, walnuts, hemp, and cashews are very low in iodine (10, 11). Plant milks fortified with iodine have an iodine content similar to cow’s milk but only a few products are iodine-fortified (11, 12).

In the United State, iodine is added to iodized salt at a rate of 76 µg per 1/4 teaspoon (1.5 gram) of salt. This amount of salt also provides 580 mg of sodium.

If salt is iodized, it will say so on the package. The salt found in packaged foods is usually not

[VIDEO] Headline: BIGBANG GD – North Koreans’ Idol?

The clip shown in the first part of the video is from the movie “Steel Rain”. The child in the video asks her father, who is a North Korean intelligence officer, if he knows GD.

More from the video:

From Hallyu Idol to North Koreans’ Idol

• A source from North Korea says: “In the 90s, they used to sing Kim Beom-ryeong’s “Wind Wind Wind” but these days, songs from idols like BIGBANG and G-Dragon are popular among the North Korean youth.”

• Stealth USBs are just like regular USBs. They appear to be empty when first plugged into a computer and have to be decrypted to access the contents.

[PHOTO] Headline: GD songs slip into the North via USB… Kim Jong-un “destroy non-socialism”

The smuggling of USBs isn’t exactly new and has been going on for years and the sad reality is those who are caught doing this face harsh consequences like getting publicly executed.

<|begin_of_text|>Question: What five-note tune might get you a cheerful two-note response if you hum it in the US, but might get you a punch in the nose if you hum it in Mexico?

Forfeit: Part of the national anthem, La Cucaracha, other traditional American or Mexican songs a Briton might know.

Answer: "Shave and a Haircut." (

Notes: In America (and I think in the UK, too?), the tune can end a song, or you could knock on a door to its rhythm. It was common in old cartoons and was a plot point in the movie "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" where the cartoon rabbit couldn't stay hidden since all someone had to do was hum "shave and a haircut" to make him respond "two bits."

The traditional American lyrics are "Shave and a haircut, two bits." As was said in Series E, "two bits" used to mean 25 cents because the Spanish dollar coin, which was used in America about 200 years ago, was cut into 1/8th slices called "bits." Contrary to what was said in Series E, it's not really used to mean a quarter anymore, and the term persists only in the "Shave and a Haircut" lyrics and as an insulting adjective that simply means "inferior."

In Mexico, however, the lyrics are a lot stronger: "Chinga (a) tu madre, cabron!" (The "a" is slurred with "chinga" so that you don't really hear it.) The translation is roughly, "Go f--k your mother, a--hole!" Most Americans have no clue about the Mexican version, and vice-versa, which could lead to quite an interesting misunderstanding. In Mexico, you can honk your horn to the five-note rhythm instead of using your middle finger. And if you knocked it on a door, it would be like saying, "Open the door, a--hole!" The origin is unclear, but the lyrics are known widely enough to offend.

Production notes: If nobody gets it, Fry could tap the first five notes on the table to see if anyone taps the next two. Then he could ask if they know the lyrics.

We know that Mars once held entire oceans of water, much like Earth. But that may not be the only thing the two planets have in common. Chemicals found in Martian rocks by NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover suggest the Red Planet once had an abundance of oxygen in its atmosphere.

Using Curiosity’s ChemCam, researchers found high levels of manganese oxides in mineral veins within a geological setting that the Curiosity mission has placed in a timeline of ancient environmental conditions. ChemCam, or the Chemistry and Camera instrument, fires laser pulses from atop the rover’s mast and observes the spectrum of resulting flashes of plasma to assess targets’ chemical makeup.

“The only ways on Earth that we know how to make these manganese materials involve atmospheric oxygen or microbes,” said Nina Lanza, a planetary scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, in a statement. “Now we’re seeing manganese oxides on Mars, and we’re wondering how the heck these could have formed?”

Theories and Parallels

The discovery, published in Geophysical Research Letters, establishes parallels between ancient Mars and Earth. While microbes are not seen as the culprit to Mars’ oxides, a sharp increase in atmospheric oxygen is. And the formation of similar compounds on Earth have marked a turning point from relatively low oxygen abundances to the oxygen-rich atmosphere we see today<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Water contains car wrecks, dead animals, excrement and rubbish... but families still go in for a dip

Lake in former limestone quarry measures pH 11.3, just less than ammonia at 11.5pH and bleach at 12.6pH

They call it the Blue Lagoon, and people come from far and wide to cool off in its clear waters.

Yet the flooded former quarry is so polluted that its contents are almost as toxic as bleach.

Signs close to the shoreline warn that not only is the water known to contain abandoned cars, dead animals and human waste, but it has a pH level of 11.3 – compared with 12.6 for bleach and 11.5 for ammonia.

Dangerous: Families pitch up on the banks of the blue lagoon in Buxton, Derbyshire, ignoring warnings that the clear blue waters have pH levels almost as strong as bleach and a re filled with rubbish

Looks can be deceiving: The water in the disused quarry gets its blue and turquoise appearance from the Limestone hills surrounding it. The water looks like something from the Mediterranean

Hecho en México….me cae, que vergüenza nacional. Ahora las dichosas, famosas, omnipotentes y glamorosas preseas mexicanas de los juegos Panamericanos se han empezado a despintar a menos de 2 semanas de su entrega, ¡HECF!

¿Pues no se suponen que eran de oro, plata y bronce? Claro que no, para comparación utilicemos las medallas olímpicas. La última medalla olímpica de oro que realmente era de oro fue otorgada en 1912. Pero por el hecho de que no sean de oro no quiere decir que son de baja calidad. Las medallas olímpicas de oro y plata están hechas de plata. Las medallas de oro llevan un recubrimiento de al menos 6 gramos de oro. Las medallas de bronce están hechas de una aleación de bronce, cobre y estaño. Pero claro, estamos hablando de las medallas olímpicas. Las medallas que fueron entregadas en los pasados juegos Panamericanos de Guadalajara fueron hechas de cobre con un bañito a la mexicana de cada metal respectivo…

Pero el bañito fue hecho tan a la mexicana que algunas medallas comenzaron a despintarse desde el primer día que fueron entregadas.

Aquí las reclamaciones de los participantes de los Panamericanos:

El remero Patrick Loliger, fue de los primeros en notar que su presea de tercer lugar comenzó a tornarse grisácea. Tras reclamar a la Casa de Moneda de México, encargada de acuñar las medallas, pidieron una disculpa y ofrecieron cambiarla.

“La medalla desde el primer día se empezó a despintar hasta que quedó de un color como acero y se le cayó la pintura color bronce. También las de tercer lugar de mi equipo se despintaron, y sé que de algunos otros deportistas también”, aseguró el deportista.

But the near-fainting spell was in fact due to dehydration, exacerbated by her condition. Her husband Bill Clinton said Monday that it wasn’t the first time. “Rarely, but on more than one occasion, over the last many, many years, the same sort of thing’s happened to her where she just got severely dehydrated,” he said.

Politico reports, citing unnamed sources, that Clinton is chronically dehydrated, and that her reluctance to regularly drink water has become a “source of tension” between the candidate and her staff. “She won’t drink water, and you try telling Hillary Clinton she has to drink water,” a source in close contact with the Democratic candidate said. Politico described a hectic rehydration mission which included lots of bottles of water as well as Gatorade.

In 2013, CBS reported that some 75% of Americans may be functioning in a chronic state of dehydration, many mistaking the symptoms for other illnesses. Whether she’s among them or not, the Democratic nominee might be better off taking a big gulp next time a staff member approaches with a glass of water.

Why do we get dehydrated?

Dehydration occurs when your body loses more fluid than you take in, upsetting its balance of salts and sugar, which affects the way it functions. Water makes up between 60-70% of average adult— and it’s important to keep levels stable. Water is essential for life and our body uses it in many different ways, from lubricating joints and regulating our temperature to enabling waste removal via sweating, bowel movements and urination.

If not treated immediately, chronic – or ongoing – dehydration can lead to serious medical complications; it can affect your kidney function, increase the risk of kidney stones and lead to muscle damage and constipation. This level of dehydration requires hospital treatment where a sufferer will be attached to a drip to restore fluids. Of patients treated for kidney stones, 50% are likely to have a recurrence within ten years.

How do we get dehydrated?

Usually, by not drinking enough fluid – usually water – to replace what you lose.

<|begin_of_text|>The final frontier smells a lot like a Nascar race—a bouquet of hot metal, diesel fumes and barbecue. The source? Dying stars, mostly.

The by-products of all this rampant combustion are smelly compounds called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. These molecules "seem to be all over the universe," says Louis Allamandola, the founder and director of the Astrophysics and Astrochemistry Lab at NASA Ames Research Center. "And they float around forever," appearing in comets, meteors and space dust. These hydrocarbons have even been shortlisted for the basis of the earliest forms of life on Earth. Not surprisingly, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can be found in coal, oil and even food.

Though a pure, unadulterated whiff of outer space is impossible for humans (it's a vacuum after all; we would die if we tried), when astronauts are outside the ISS, space-borne compounds adhere to their suits and hitch a ride back into the station. Astronauts have reported smelling "burned" or "fried" steak after a space walk, and they aren't just dreaming of a home-cooked meal.

The smell of space is so distinct that, three years ago, NASA reached out to Steven Pearce of the fragrance maker Omega Ingredients to re-create the odor for its training simulations. "Recently we did the smell of the moon," Pearce says. "Astronauts compared it to spent gunpowder."

Allamandola explains that our solar system is particularly pungent because it is rich in carbon and low in oxygen, and "just like a car, if you starve it of oxygen you start to see black soot and get a foul smell." Oxygen-rich stars, however, have aromas reminiscent of a charcoal grill. Once you leave our galaxy, the smells can get really interesting. In dark pockets of the universe, molecular clouds full of tiny dust particles host a veritable smorgasbord of odors, from wafts of sweet sugar to the rotten-egg stench of sulfur.

As everyone knows, tasmanian camels never go backwards, especially when on a precarious ledge. The camels will climb over each other, but only if there is a camel sized space on the other side. The camels didn't see each other until there was only exactly one camel's width between the two groups. How can all camels pass, allowing both groups to go on their way, without any camel reversing? Show Hint Show Solution Hint: Use match sticks or coins to simulate the puzzle. Solution: First a camel from one side moves forward, then two camels from the other side move forward, then three camels from the first side move forward etc...

etc...

2. The Waiter Three men in a cafe order a meal the total cost of which is $15. They each contribute $5. The waiter takes the money to the chef who recognizes the three as friends and asks the waiter to return $5 to the men. The waiter is not only poor at mathematics but dishonest and instead of going to the trouble of splitting the $5 between the three he simply gives them $1 each and pockets the remaining $2 for himself. Now, each of the men effectively paid $4, the total paid is therefore $12. Add the $2 in the waiters pocket and this comes to $14.....where has the other $1 gone from the original $15? Show Solution Solution: The payments should equal the receipts. It does not make sense to add what was paid by the men ($12) to what was received from that payment by the waiter ($2) Although the initial bill was $15 dollars, one of the five dollar notes gets changed into five ones.

An international research team discovered the ice in crystalline form on the surface of comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko, Churi for short, indicating that it was formed 4.6 billion years ago — the results of the experiment have been published in the Astrophysical Journal.

The comet, which is part of the planet Jupiter family, has found to have ice crystals on its surface that could have originated in space before the solar system or the sun was formed in conditions described by scientists as protosolar nebula.

Hi @ESA_Rosetta! Comet #67P on 05 Mar 16 from a distance of 20km (more at https://t.co/lNzznIHGkw) pic.twitter.com/tyzkA2AS3a — Rosetta OSIRIS (@Rosetta_OSIRIS) 10 March 2016​

By analyzing chemicals trapped in the ice on the comet's surface, researchers were able to determine the age of the ice crystals using a mass spectrometer — which is an instrument that can measure the masses and relative concentrations of atoms and molecules. A statement from the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) said:

"If comets are made of crystalline ice, this means that they must have formed at the same time as the solar system, that than earlier in the interstellar medium."

Before Life Began

The discovery of ice crystals on Churi could have implications on future research surrounding how the earth and solar system began life.

"In October 2014 [the mass spectrometer] first measured amounts of molecular nitrogen (N2), carbon monoxide (CO) and argon (Ar) in Churi's ice," a statement from the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) said.

"The data was compared with that from laboratory experiments on amorphous ice, as well as from models describing the composition of gas hydrates, a type of crystalline ice in which water molecules can trap molecules of gas."

The levels of nitrogen and argon gas in the ice led the researchers to conclude that is had a crystalline structure, suggesting the ice on the surface of the comet could have been formed before the solar system, or even at the same

So when the Japanese reporters write about the US reaction (if any) to the law, they try their best to elicit the response they want to hear; failing that, they still hear what they want to hear and write about what they believe they hear. In other words, they goalseek.

First it was Mainichi Shinbun (12/7/2013) who reported on the US reaction to the passage of the State Secret Protection Law:

ハーフ副報道官は「情報の保全は同盟国間の協力に決定的な役割を果たす」と述べ、日米両政府が共有する情報の保全が必要であるとの認識を示した。ただ、ハーフ氏は「表現の自由、報道の自由などの普遍的価値の共有が我々の同盟関係の基盤である」とも述べ、同法を根拠に言論の自由を制限することがないよう日本政府に求めた。

Deputy Spokesperson Harf said "Information security plays a critical role in alliance cooperation," indicating security of information shared by both the Japanese government and the US government is necessary. However, [Ms.] Harf also said, "A foundation of our alliance is a shared commitment to universal values such as freedom of expression and freedom of the press," by which remark she requested the Japanese government not to limit the freedom of speech based on the [State Secrecy Protection] Law.

Thus, according to Mainichi, the US Obama administration has expressed concern that the Japanese government may restrict freedom of speech under the law.

That's odd, I thought, coming from this US administration.

Then, the Asahi Shinbun reporter whom I follow on Twitter tweeted about part of the US State Department Press Briefing on December 6, 2013, which concerned the State Secrecy Protection Law that passed the Opper House on December 6 (Japan Standard Time) and became the law of the land. He said:

A serious recommendation is to use a strong password generator rather than this technique and to store passwords in a digital safe itself locked with a strong password.

Coming up with a secure password that cannot be bruteforce or dictionary attacked but that is easy to remember is quite troubling. So, here’s the nerdiest approach yet.

Think of a compound, any compound, but preferably one with which you are familiar. If you’re in science, then you could pick a compound associated with your research thesis or perhaps the medication you needed to get through the viva.

Now, work out, or look up, its chemical formula. BUT DO NOT STOP THERE…Next, think of a simple algorithm to obfuscate the formula (reverse it and chop off each end perhaps, or if it is a long formula extract all the numbers and put them at one end instead of after each element symbol, you get the idea). Of course, if you pick a compound that happens to share the first couple of letters with the name of the site to which you are logging in, then that should make it easier to remember too.

If you suffer from hayfever you might be using flixonase, when you login to flickr, for example. Formula: C25H31F3O5S, password could be CHFOS253135 or 5O3F13H52. No bruteforce hack attack is going to figure those out in a hurry. Specialists in secondary messenger chemistry with a MySpace account could choose myo-inositol (C6H12O6 –> CHO6126), while nutritional chemists could hide their Facebook behind Factor II (vitamin B12) C 63 H 89 CoN 14 O 14 P –> CHCONOP63891414.

Of course, you will have to think of your own examples, but with CAS and ChemSpider registering tens of millions of structures, that should not be too hard to do.

Of course, being a chemist you also know about InChi and Smiles string, which could provide you with an even more sophisticated password. The InChi string for aspirin, for instance, is <span class=”chem:inchi”>InChI=1/C9H8O4/c1-6(10)13-8-5-3-2-

Abstract: The Silver Impregnated Porous Pot (SIPP) filter is a product of the Tshwane University of Technology manufactured for the production of safe drinking water at a household (home) level. Two SIPP devices were assessed for the reduction efficiency of chemical contaminants such as calcium, magnesium, iron, arsenic, fluorides and total organic carbon (TOC) as well as microbial contaminants from environmental samples. Turbidity change after filtration, together with correlation between chlorophyll a in the feed water and SIPP’s flow rates were also evaluated in order to give comprehensive guidelines on the quality of intake water that could be filtered through the filter without causing a significant decrease in flow rate. The SIPP filters removed contaminants from environmental water samples as follows: 70% to 92% iron, 36% to 68% calcium, 42% to 82% arsenic, 39% to 98% magnesium, 39% to 95% fluorides, 12% to 35% TOC and 45% to 82% turbidity. The SIPP filters had initial flow rates of 1 L/h to 4 L/h but the flow rates dropped to 0.5 L/h with an increase in cumulative volume of intake water as the filter was used. Turbidity and chemical contaminant reduction rates decreased with accumulating volume of intake water but the filter removed Ca, Fe and Mg to levels that comply with the South African National Standards (SANS 241) and the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline values. However, the SIPP filters cannot produce enough water to satisfy the daily drinking water requirement of a typical household (25 L/p·d). Chlorophyll a was associated with a decrease in the flow rate through the SIPP filters.

Go here to find the largest selection of Blue lagoon tours in Iceland The Lagoon is just a fifteen-minute drive from Keflavík International Airport, or a thirty-minute drive from Reykjavík, located between the two. It is thus often visited straight after arrival to the country or right before departure. There are few better ways to recharge after a long-flight or action-packed holiday. History The Blue Lagoon started as a pool of wastewater from the Svartsengi geothermal plant in 1976. The first person to bathe there was Valur Margeirsson in 1981. He was met with some resistance prior to taking the first dip as people thought he was mad for wanting to bath in a "blue mud pool". He and others soon began to notice the unusual but remarkable healing qualities of the azure waters. Those with conditions such as psoriasis found the waters immediately soothing for their condition. News quickly spread, and by 1987, the first swimming facilities were officially opened. Since then, the establishment has only grown, from an open pool with no surrounding buildings to a luxurious spa, research centre and hotel. Today The Blue Lagoon is considered to have such notable regenerative qualities because the water is rich in silica and sulphur. A research and development facility on site finds cures and remedies for skin ailments, and silica mud is available for free on the sides of the pool for guests to enjoy a facemask. The temperature in the bathing and swimming area is very comfortable, averaging 37–39° C (98–102° F). The Blue Lagoon also boasts the LAVA Restaurant, the Blue Café and the Lagoon Spa: you can thus enjoy cocktails, health products, delicious meals and treatments such as massages without leaving the premises. Saunas, steam rooms and a small waterfall are also on site. For all of these reasons and more, the Blue Lagoon is considered to be one of the most enjoyable and romantic spots in the country. It is surrounded by a plethora of fantastic volcanic landscapes, and the water itself is opaque and vividly blue. Rising pillars of steam only add to the spa’s fantastic ambience. Things to Note The Blue Lagoon Spa is open throughout the year, and popular in every season. Due to the fact it has a maximum capacity for the comfort of its guests,

<|begin_of_text|>How many atoms are there in a kilogram of silicon? This number is Avogadro’s constant and working out its value is one of the more important tasks that materials scientists face.

Today, a group of physicists reveal the answer. They say there are 6.02214084(18) × 10^23 atoms in a single crystal of silicon weighing about a kilogram. And they say they know this is right because they’ve counted them. Yep, counted them.

Actually, they counted the number of atoms in a unit volume of silicon and measured the size of this volume. The number of times this fits into a lump of exactly 1 mole of near perfect single crystal sphere of silicon is Avogadro’s number.

To have established this number to such accuracy is clearly an important piece of work but just how impressive is put in perspective by the monumental efforts of the international consortium behind it.

The work began in 2004 when a Russian group created a sample of silicon flouride with a specific isotopic content at the Central Design Bureau of Machine Building in St. Petersburg. A team at the Institute of Chemistry of High-Purity Substances of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Nizhny-Novgorod then turned this into a polycrystal of silicon hydride which a group at the Leibniz-Institut fur Kristallzuchtung in Berlin used to grow a 5kg lump of pure monocrystalline silicon in 2007.

The Australian Centre for Precision Optics then took samples from this lump and shaped them into quasi-perfect spheres. They then made an x-ray interferometer from the left over silicon to determine its crystal structure. They also measured crystals’ surfaces to see what kind of crud had built up there and would therefore have to be taken into account in the final calculations. (Various copper, nickel and silicon oxides had built up on the surface.)

Various groups then measured the mass of the spheres by comparing them to the platinum-iridium test kilograms owned by the PTB (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt) in Germany, the National Metrology Institute of Japan in Tskuba and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures in France.

The team then measured the volume of the spheres using optical interferometry. And the isotope content was measured by teams at the University of Warsaw, the Institute of Mineral Resources of the Chinese Academy of Science and Institute for Physics of Microstructures of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

The schematic structure of the flexible FENG-based acoustic transducer is shown in Fig. 1a. The total thickness of the device is <100 μm. The functional material of the FENG-based acoustic transducers is prepared by starting with polypropylene film containing tiny foreign silicates particles (0.1–10 μm), as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. Polypropylene (PP) is a type of commodity plastic with the merits of low density, high flexibility and good resistance to fatigue30,31. Once the PP film experiences stretching in two perpendicular directions, the inorganic particles serve as stress concentrators or micocracks, allowing the film to be filled with lens-shaped voids with diameters ranging from 1 to 100 μm. During this process, high pressure (for example, 5 MPa) nitrogen or carbon dioxide gas is diffused into the PP film, so that the internal pressure within the voids becomes equal to the external pressure. Next, the external gas pressure is suddenly released, resulting in dramatically swell of those voids in PP film. For the purpose of stabilizing and stiffening the swelling voids at room temperature, thermal treatment (usually >100 °C) is carried out to increase the crystallinity of the polymer matrix32,33,34. Subsequently, by applying a large electric field to the treated film, Paschen breakdown occurs inside the voids. The current within the air gap transfers a sheet charge density across the air gap. During microplasma discharge, charges separated by the ionization of the gas transportation under the charging field and light flashes can be observed with the naked eye, forming a ‘microstorm’. After microplasma discharging, two thin layers of silver (500 nm) were deposited on both top and bottom side of PP film (80 μm) by sputtering. Scanning electron microscopyimages of the cross-section of PP foam are shown in Fig. 1b. Herein, backscattered electrons are used for revealing good contrast and clear definition of the structure. As the production of backscattered electrons is strongly dependent on the average atomic number of the sample, silicate particles appeared to be much brighter than their surrounding structure. Figure 1c shows the optical images of FENG-based acoustic device rolled along the axial of a glass tube.

<|begin_of_text|>The only painful part of wearing an adhesive bandage is having to peel them off, so researchers at Purdue University's Birck Nanotechnology Center have developed a way to turn Band-Aids into a nearly pain free alternative to needles. By integrating a tiny heat-powered pump, adhesive patches could automatically deliver medication to a patient without the need for a painful prick.

What's most interesting is that the tiny pump isn't packed full of nano-scale sized bleeding-edge technology. Instead, a small chamber sandwiched between layers of flexible polymer is filled with nothing more than sugar and baker's yeast. When the patch is stuck to the skin and moistened, the water and the patient's body heat causes the yeast and sugar to ferment which produces carbon dioxide. And as the CO2 gas causes the chamber to expand, it pushes against the flexible polymer membranes which could one day be covered in microneedles that automatically inject a given type of medication through the skin without the patient ever feeling a thing.

The Purdue researchers aren't the first to explore the possibilites of the microneedle approach, but the development of their fermentation pump means that medicinal patches could be incredibly cheap to produce, and easy to use. And somehow slapping a Tylenol patch on your forehead just seems like it would be far more effective than taking a pill. [Purdue University via Gizmag]

Carl Sagan once said that "the surface of the Earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean, and recently we've waded a little way out, maybe ankle deep"—that was in 1980, and we haven't risked testing the water any deeper since then.

One of the main reasons for that, though, is that space is so frustratingly massive. Voyager 1 is the fastest man-made thing ever, but 17 kilometers per second is a tiny fraction of the speed of light. Even getting to one of our nearest neighbors, Mars, would take six to eight months using conventional spaceship engines. Ideas like warp drives are still theoretical, and unlikely to be seen within our lifetimes. However, it might be possible to cut that trip to Mars down to as few as three months using a form of fusion fuel—"dilithium crystals." Yep, just like Star Trek.

It's not quite the same, of course. In the sci-fi series, the crystals are a rare substance that the crew spend an inordinate amount of time searching for, and their engines can use it to travel faster than the speed of light. This engine, currently under development at the University of Hunstville by a team working in collaboration with Boeing, NASA and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, would by comparison be about twice as fast as the best current technology.

According to Txchnologist, General Electric's online tech magazine, this fusion reactor would be fueled by "a few tons" of deuterium (a heavy isotope of hydrogen) and lithium-6 (a stable molecule of lithium) in a crystalline structure‚ hence the "dilithium crystal" claim. Technically, dilithium is a molecule with two covalently bonded lithium atoms, while lithium-6 features six bonded atoms, but we can forgive them for the temptation of using a little poetic license. When the deuterium and the lithium-6 are forced together under high pressure they undergo a fusion reaction—a process which they're still trying to turn into a net producer of energy. While fusion isn't yet a viable fuel source, recent developments in the field seem to indicate that we can't be far away.

The engine, dubbed the "Charger-1 Pulsed Power Generator", would be constructed in space along with the rest of the spaceship to avoid the tricky engineering difficulties of getting all that delicate fusion equipment up through the atmosphere

"Jsme ve vládě, ale nemáme žádnou moc," řekl Lulův blízký poradce, dominikánský mnich Frei Betto. "Dnešní moc je globální moc, moc velkých podniků, moc finančního kapitálu."

Omezená schopnost vlád států realizovat jakoukoliv politiku, kterou předem neschválil mezinárodní kapitál, je dnes křížem, na nějž jsme byli přibiti všichni.

Running 46 minutes late because of a last-second technical snag, the 1.6-million-pound Atlas 5, equipped with three strap-on solid-fuel boosters for extra power, roared to life at 2:13 p.m. EST (GMT-5) and quickly lifted off from launch complex 41 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, arcing away to the east under a mostly clear sky.

Rapidly accelerating as it consumed its liquid oxygen and kerosene propellants, the 194-foot-tall rocket put on a weekend show for area residents, beachgoers and tourists, leaving a long trail of exhaust in its wake as it climbed out of the dense lower atmosphere and disappeared from view.

The Russian-built RD-180 engine powering the first stage chalked up an apparently flawless performance, handing off to the rocket’s Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10C Centaur second stage engine a little more than four-and-a-half minutes after launch.

As planned, the hydrogen-fueled Centaur engine fired twice and 32 minutes after launch, the 14,914-pound relay station was released from the second stage into a so-called “supersynchronous” orbit with a low point of 127 miles and a high point of around 40,389 miles.

EchoStar 19’s on-board propulsion system will be used to circularize the orbit at an altitude of 22,300 miles above the equator where spacecraft take 24 hours to complete one trip around the planet. In such geosynchronous orbits, satellites appear to hang stationary in the sky, allowing the use of fixed antennas on the ground.

EchoStar operates a fleet of two dozen solely owned, leased and managed relay stations. EchoStar 19, built by Space Systems Loral, will be stationed over North America to provide high-speed broadband internet service from HughesNet, an EchoStar subsidiary that currently serves more than a million customers with two existing satellites -- EchoStar 17 and Spaceway 3.

Along with providing service to rural areas not wired for broadband, EchoStar 19 also will provide 200 megabits-per-second access to passenger jets.

Glycine is also known as a "helix breaker".

Glycine is a colorless, sweet-tasting crystalline solid. It is the only achiral proteinogenic amino acid. It can fit into hydrophilic or hydrophobic environments, due to its minimal side chain of only one hydrogen atom. The acyl radical is glycyl.

Glycine is a white crystalline solid

History and etymology [ edit ]

Glycine was discovered in 1820 by the French chemist Henri Braconnot when he hydrolyzed gelatin by boiling it with sulfuric acid.[6] He originally called it "sugar of gelatin",[7][8] but the French chemist Jean-Baptiste Boussingault showed that it contained nitrogen.[9] The American scientist Eben Norton Horsford, then a student of the German chemist Justus von Liebig, proposed the name "glycocoll";[10][11] however, the Swedish chemist Berzelius suggested the simpler name "glycine".[12][13] The name comes from the Greek word γλυκύς "sweet tasting"[14] (which is also related to the prefixes glyco- and gluco-, as in glycoprotein and glucose). In 1858, the French chemist Auguste Cahours determined that glycine was an amine of acetic acid.[15]

Production [ edit ]

Although glycine can be isolated from hydrolyzed protein, this is not used for industrial production, as it can be manufactured more conveniently by chemical synthesis.[16] The two main processes are amination of chloroacetic acid with ammonia, giving glycine and ammonium chloride,[17] and the Strecker amino acid synthesis,[18] which is the main synthetic method in the United States and Japan.[19] About 15 thousand tonnes are produced annually in this

The western 'head' region consists mostly of heavily cratered 'alpine' terrain. The middle part of Cthulhu Macula is meanwhile a smooth plain, probably formed through large cryovolcanic eruptions, like Vulcan Planum on Charon. This part appears to be younger than the alpine terrain to the east, but there are nevertheless several large craters located in this region. The western 'tail' region of Cthulhu Macula was imaged in much lower resolution than the eastern part, but it can be inferred that this is a hilly landscape bordered by mountains to the west.[9][10][11] Higher-resolution images of the border between the two regions indicate that lighter material from Sputnik Planitia, composed of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane ices, may be invading and overlaying the easternmost part of the dark Cthulhu Macula.[12] As of 30 July 2015, the eastern "head" region had been imaged in much higher resolution than the western "tail" region.[13]

<|begin_of_text|>Scientists believe that the first alcoholic beverage ever made was a combination of honey, and perhaps grains, that wild yeast and bacteria fermented spontaneously. Someone along the way decided to drink said beverage and voila!

This honey wine/ beer mashup was nothing akin to our modern understanding of mead or beer, but it was the foundation of some of the greatest beverages known to man. Over many years, the two have become distinct beverages. That’s probably because the official term for such a hybrid of beer and mead is braggot, and anything that rhymes with maggot was clearly not meant to be popular.

At heart, mead, aka honey wine, is a truly simple beverage. It can be carbonated like beer, or kept still like a table wine. I have mostly preferred carbonated meads personally. If you let mead ferment fully, and do not add any additional sugars, which is my preference, you’ll end up with a delicious, champagne-like beverage (especially if you use a champagne yeast for fermentation). If you’ve never tried mead, I’d recommend trying offerings from RedStone and B Nektar – both excellent mead makers.

The basic mead recipe is honey, yeast, and enough water to reach the brewer’s desired gravity, or sugar concentration. Frequently mead home-brewers will also add a Yeast Nutrient since honey doesn’t have the same inherent nutrients that malts do for beer which ensure active and healthy fermentation.

I decided to make mead last year after reading one of many brewing books I own, specifically, The Brewer’s Apprentice, written by none other than Greg Koch of Stone Brewing, and Matt Allyn, an award winning home brewer and Certified Beer Judge. Chapter 16 of the book is dedicated to mead, and though I had only tried it a handful of times, I got to thinking this would be a fun experiment.

Since we were mead-brewing virgins, me and the hubs liked the idea of trying a few ‘recipes’. We purchased five 1 gallon fermentors and made small batches using a variety of honeys, specifically Mesquite Desert honey from Trader Joe’s, local raw honey, plus wildflower, buckwheat, and orange blossom honey from Deer Creek Honey Farms.

You’d think all honeys would taste rather similar but there really is a huge difference in the flavor of honeys from different locations and which plants they pollinate. Mesquite honey is a bit spicy, while the orange blossom is citrusy

Posted on 14 August 2011 by MarkR

Recently there’s been a resurgence in claims that CO 2 rise is caused by 'natural' temperature rise rather than humans. Various arguments are used to make this sound sensible (see Paolo Soares, Murry Salby and Joe Bastardi), but they’re wrong.

I’m going to pick on just one of the claims Joe Bastardi made in a comment at Tamino’s blog and this is written as an explanation to Joe of why I’m convinced he’s wrong. I hope readers will be able to point out if I’ve made a mistake and work out which argument you think makes the most sense. Bastardi claims that:

“The answer is obvious. it is the earths temperature which is driving the co2 release into the atmosphere.”

I’m going to start with chemistry; most carbon in the atmosphere is in CO2 and it can move between the atmosphere and land/oceans through chemical reactions. Billions of tons of carbon don't magically turn into pixie dust.

Next some maths: if I have one ton of carbon and I add another ton of carbon then I have two. We can write this down as an equation for the change in atmospheric CO 2 over a year, ΔC atm :

This says that if I ‘emit’ a ton of carbon by, say, triggering a volcano then the atmosphere will gain a ton. If I ‘absorb’ a ton of carbon by growing a tree, then the atmosphere loses a ton.

We can expand the equation by counting human emissions (HE) and absorption (HA) and natural emissions (NE) and absorption (NA) separately.

This works because carbon is additive. If a volcano emits a ton of carbon and a factory emits a ton then the atmosphere has gained two tons. This is a very simple balance sheet for the carbon cycle and fortunately there are ‘accountants’ who’ve measured some of these values for us.

Recently the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has been rising at ~2 parts per million per year, or around 15 billion tons/year. Meanwhile human emissions excluding land use change (like clearing or planting forests) are 30 billion tons per year. In billions of tons per year we have:

We can rearrange this:

Humans are also clearing rainforests and changing land use, but here I'll assume that human effects on absorption (HA) are not much different from zero, i.e.

Historical references [ edit ]

The earliest textual references to Japan are in Chinese classic texts. Within the official Chinese dynastic Twenty-Four Histories, Japan is mentioned among the so-called Dongyi 東夷 "Eastern Barbarians". Note that the following texts are chronologically ordered by date of compilation, which does not always correspond with the sequence of Dynasties in Chinese history. In traditional Chinese units of measurement, distance is recorded in lǐ 里, which varied among dynastic standards, roughly equivalent to 300–400 meters. Ryūsaku Tsunoda (1951:4) cautions that great distances in thousands of lǐ "are, of course, not to be taken literally."

The historian Wang Zhenping summarizes Wo contacts with the Han State.

When chieftains of various Wo tribes contacted authorities at Lelang, a Chinese commandery established in northern Korea in 108 B.C. by the Western Han court, they sought to benefit themselves by initiating contact. In A.D. 57, the first Wo ambassador arrived at the capital of the Eastern Han court (25-220); the second came in 107. Wo diplomats, however, never called on China on a regular basis. A chronology of Japan-China relations from the first to the ninth centuries reveals this irregularity in the visits of Japanese ambassadors to China. There were periods of frequent contacts as well as of lengthy intervals between contacts. This irregularity clearly indicated that, in its diplomacy with China, Japan set its own agenda and acted on self-interest to satisfy its own needs. No Wo ambassador, for example, came to China during the second century

(CNN) — The Hubble space telescope peers hundreds, thousands, millions of light years into the universe to study novas, quasars and nebulas.

But weeks ago, it pulled its focus way in close — to just light minutes away — to view a rare and beautiful spectacle at the planet Jupiter.

Three big moons crossed past it at the same time, casting their shadows onto Jupiter’s swirling surface.

From the perspective of people theoretically standing down on Jupiter, it would be like three solar eclipses happening at once, astronomers said.

A photo gift

In the last 15 years, this has happened only twice, the Space Telescope Science Institute said. “The next one will be 2032,” said astronomer Carol Christian.

So, Hubble shot photos rapid fire to capture the rare conjunction in late January. And STScI published them on Thursday, along with a short fast-motion video animation.

There was no great scientific gain in Hubble taking the snaps. The moons and their crossings have been examined plenty and are well known.

“We felt that there are images which have aesthetic value above and beyond their scientific value,” said astronomer Zolt Levy.

It was a gift of beauty to the public.

62 moons, 4 big ones

Jupiter is a sort of mini-solar system inside our solar system.

It’s the largest body after the sun. And like the sun, it comprises a lot of helium and hydrogen gas, but it doesn’t have enough mass to burst into the intense nuclear fusion that makes the sun a fireball, NASA says.

It has many satellites, including 62 moons, and they swarm around the planet with many of them crossing the surface facing Earth constantly.

But only four of them are highly visible standouts. They are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.

Just like Galileo

The four moons are called the Galilean satellites, because Renaissance astronomer Galileo Galilei discovered them in 1610, when he pointed his telescope skyward, forever changing human perception of our place in the cosmos.

Many of today’s hobby telescopes are much stronger than his, so anyone can easily follow in his footsteps and cast the same gaze.

And many did, when the three moons passed, posting their recordings of the triple moon transit on YouTube.

<|begin_of_text|>In thermodynamics, the triple point of a substance is the temperature and pressure at which the three phases (gas, liquid, and solid) of that substance coexist in thermodynamic equilibrium.[1] It is that temperature and pressure at which the sublimation curve, fusion curve and the vaporisation curve meet. For example, the triple point of mercury occurs at a temperature of −38.83440 °C and a pressure of 0.2 mPa.

In addition to the triple point for solid, liquid, and gas phases, a triple point may involve more than one solid phase, for substances with multiple polymorphs. Helium-4 is a special case that presents a triple point involving two different fluid phases (lambda point).[1]

The triple point of water was used to define the kelvin, the base unit of thermodynamic temperature in the International System of Units (SI).[2] The value of the triple point of water was fixed by definition, rather than measured, but that changed with the 2019 redefinition of SI base units. The triple points of several substances are used to define points in the ITS-90 international temperature scale, ranging from the triple point of hydrogen (13.8033 K) to the triple point of water (273.16 K, 0.01 °C, or 32.018 °F).

The term "triple point" was coined in 1873 by James Thomson, brother of Lord Kelvin.[3]

A typical phase diagram. The solid green line applies to most substances; the dashed green line gives the anomalous behavior of water

The single combination of pressure and temperature at which liquid water, solid ice, and water vapor can coexist in a stable equilibrium occurs at exactly 273.1600 K (0.0100 °C; 32.0180 °F) and a partial vapor pressure of 611.657 pascals (6.11657 mbar; 0.00603659 atm).[4][5] At that point, it is possible to change all of the substance to ice, water, or vapor by making arbitrarily small changes in pressure and temperature. Even if the total pressure of a system is well above the triple point of water, provided that the partial pressure of the water vapor is 611.657 pascals, then the system can still be brought to the triple point of water.

<|begin_of_text|>This article is about air conditioning. For similar concept in atomic physics, see Evaporative cooling (atomic physics)

An evaporative cooler (also swamp cooler, swamp box, desert cooler and wet air cooler) is a device that cools air through the evaporation of water. Evaporative cooling differs from typical air conditioning systems, which use vapor-compression or absorption refrigeration cycles. Evaporative cooling uses the fact that water will absorb a relatively large amount of heat in order to evaporate (that is, it has a large enthalpy of vaporization). The temperature of dry air can be dropped significantly through the phase transition of liquid water to water vapor (evaporation). This can cool air using much less energy than refrigeration. In extremely dry climates, evaporative cooling of air has the added benefit of conditioning the air with more moisture for the comfort of building occupants.

The cooling potential for evaporative cooling is dependent on the wet-bulb depression, the difference between dry-bulb temperature and wet-bulb temperature (see relative humidity). In arid climates, evaporative cooling can reduce energy consumption and total equipment for conditioning as an alternative to compressor-based cooling. In climates not considered arid, indirect evaporative cooling can still take advantage of the evaporative cooling process without increasing humidity. Passive evaporative cooling strategies can offer the same benefits of mechanical evaporative cooling systems without the complexity of equipment and ductwork.

qanat, used for evaporative cooling of buildings Schematic diagram of an ancient Iranian windcatcher and, used for evaporative cooling of buildings

An earlier form of evaporative cooling, the windcatcher, was first used in ancient Egypt and Persia thousands of years ago in the form of wind shafts on the roof. They caught the wind, passed it over subterranean water in a qanat and discharged the cooled air into the building. Modern Iranians have widely adopted powered evaporative coolers (coolere âbi).[1]

The evaporative cooler was the subject of numerous US patents in the 20th century; many of these, starting in 1906,[2] suggested or assumed the use of excelsior (wood wool) pads as the elements to bring a large volume of water in contact with moving air to allow evaporation to occur. A typical design, as shown in a 1945 patent, includes a water reservoir (usually with level controlled by a float valve), a pump to circulate water over the excelsior pads and

Building on work he and his companies did with Johnson Space Center’s In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) team, Robert Zubrin has developed and commercialized technologies that could prove revolutionary in their Earth applications, such as a system that could extract millions of barrels of oil from defunct oil wells around the world and another that can harness all the natural gas currently burned off as waste at many oil drilling rigs (Spinoff 2015).

But when he’s not working to change this world or colonize others, the president of Pioneer Astronautics, Pioneer Energy, and the Mars Society enjoys a good microbrew. Now, he’s applied some of that same technology to cut costs for craft breweries that produce anywhere between 3,000 and 300,000 barrels per year.

Beginning in the mid-1990s, as a NASA contractor and then as founder of Pioneer Aeronautics, Zubrin worked with Johnson’s ISRU team to develop technology that could break down elements that are abundant on Mars and turn them into essential resources for exploration missions. Early work devised means to capture the carbon dioxide (CO2) that comprises more than 95 percent of the thin Martian atmosphere and turn it into oxygen and fuel. He built systems that could, for example, collect and separate CO2 from other gases, raise its pressure by two orders of magnitude, combine it with hydrogen to make methane and water, break the water down into oxygen and hydrogen, and remove water vapor from the resulting oxygen before it was stored.

Some of this technology, such as systems that manipulate temperature and pressure to liquefy and store gases or to strip water from a gas, as well as the technology that allows such systems to run autonomously, has found its way into Lakewood, Colorado-based Pioneer Energy’s latest creation, the CO2 Craft Brewery Recovery System.

Technology Transfer

“When you ferment beer, the process that produces alcohol also produces carbon dioxide,” Zubrin explains, noting that CO2 is also necessary later, to carbonate the beverage.

Major breweries typically have systems that capture the carbon dioxide produced during fermentation for use in carbonation and other functions, such as purging process tanks. These are high-capacity, multimillion-dollar systems, however, and don’t make sense for a small craft brewery. “They don’t have the capacity to liquefy the carbon dioxide that comes off their fermenters to put it into the beer,” Zubrin says. Instead, microbreweries are left to release the gas from fermentation and buy carbon dioxide from

Right: Skyrmions can stack up to form a triangular (‘honeycomb’) or square lattice. Reprinted by permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd: Nature Materials (Ref. 1), copyright (2017).

Tiny swirling magnetic patterns called skyrmions (Fig. 1, left) can pack together to form neat lattices inside certain magnetic materials. These lattices are promising for spintronics—a new form of computing that exploits the magnetic characteristics of atoms to manage data. But their usefulness is limited because they typically exist only within a narrow window of temperatures and magnetic fields.

Now, Kosuke Karube of the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science and colleagues have discovered that skyrmion lattices in a crystalline cobalt−zinc−manganese alloy can survive over a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields, pointing the way to practical skyrmion-based spintronics1.

Each of the three metals—cobalt, zinc and manganese—in the alloy has unique magnetic properties that influence the material’s magnetism. Below 27 degrees Celsius, the alloy can assume several different magnetic states, which Karube’s team mapped using techniques such as neutron scattering.

Between 11 and 27 degrees Celsius, a stable honeycomb lattice of skyrmions (Fig. 1, top right) formed when a small magnetic field was applied. But when the temperature dropped below 11 degrees Celsius, the skyrmion lattice was no longer in the most energetically stable state. Instead, very slow cooling caused each atom to orient its magnetism so that it was slightly out of alignment with its neighbors, which collectively formed spirals in the crystal’s intrinsic magnetism. These spirals come in two forms, known as helical and conical magnetic states.

However, relatively rapid cooling prevented these states from occurring and preserved the honeycomb skyrmion lattice in a higher-energy ‘metastable’ state. This lattice was stable enough to last indefinitely below –13 degrees Celsius under a broad range of magnetic fields.

Below about –123 degrees Celsius, the lattice began to change shape to form a square lattice, which had never been seen before (Fig.

The spacecraft, known as Prospector-1, would study the yet-to-be-selected asteroid to determine the value of its resources for mining. It’ll also put Deep Space Industries’ water-based propulsion system to an interplanetary test.

“Deep Space Industries has worked diligently to get to this point, and now we can say with confidence that we have the right technology, the right team and the right plan to execute this historic mission,” Rick Tumlinson, DSI’s board chairman and co-founder, said in a news release.

California-based DSI and its partners in Luxembourg say they’ll launch a precursor satellite called Prospector-X into low Earth orbit next year to test the technologies that would be used for Prospector-1.

DSI sees near-Earth asteroids as potentially valuable sources for materials ranging from plain old water ice – which can be processed into breathable oxygen and drinkable water as well as propellant – to in-space building materials and precious metals.

If DSI sticks to its schedule, Prospector-1 could become the first commercial asteroid mining exploration mission. However, Planetary Resources, which is based in Redmond, Wash., is also taking aim at asteroids.

Planetary Resources had its first precursor spacecraft, Arkyd-3R, deployed into orbit for a five-month test mission last year. A larger spacecraft, the Arkyd-6A, is being readied for launch later this year and will observe Earth in infrared wavelengths as a practice round for asteroid prospecting.

Planetary Resources says its next-generation space telescopes, known as the Arkyd 100 and Arkyd 200, could start studying the composition of near-Earth asteroids in the 2017-2019 time frame. At the same time, the company plans to create a constellation of Earth-observing satellites known as Ceres.

If suitable targets are identified, Planetary Resources could begin extracting materials from asteroids by the mid-2020s, according to the company’s president and CEO, Chris Lewicki.

Planetary Resources has raised tens of millions of dollars since its founding in 2012.

A photogenic and favorite target for amateur astronomers, the full beauty of nearby barred spiral galaxy M83 is unveiled in all of its glory in this Hubble Space Telescope mosaic image. The vibrant magentas and blues reveal that the galaxy is ablaze with star formation. The galaxy, also known as the Southern Pinwheel, lies 15 million light-years away in the constellation Hydra.

The Hubble photograph captures thousands of star clusters, hundreds of thousands of individual stars, and “ghosts” of dead stars called supernova remnants. The galactic panorama unveils a tapestry of the drama of stellar birth and death spread across 50,000 light-years.

The newest generations of stars are forming largely in clusters on the edges of the dark spiral dust lanes. These brilliant young stellar groupings, only a few million years old, produce huge amounts of ultraviolet light that is absorbed by surrounding diffuse gas clouds, causing them to glow in pinkish hydrogen light.

Gradually, the fierce stellar winds from the youngest most massive stars blow away the gas, revealing bright blue star clusters and giving a “Swiss cheese” appearance to the spiral arms. These youngest star clusters are about 1 million to 10 million years old. The populations of stars up to 100 million years or older appear yellow or orange by comparison because the young blue stars have already burned out.

Interstellar “bubbles” produced by nearly 300 supernovas from massive stars have been found in this Hubble image. By studying these supernova remnants, astronomers can better understand the nature of the stars that exploded and dispersed nuclear processed chemical elements back into the galaxy, contributing to the next generation of new stars.

This image is being used to support a citizen science project titled STAR DATE: M83. The primary goal is to estimate ages for approximately 3,000 star clusters. Amateur scientists will use the presence or absence of the pink hydrogen emission, the sharpness of the individual stars, and the color of the clusters to estimate ages. Participants will measure the sizes of the star clusters and any associated emission nebulae. Finally, the citizen scientists will “explore” the image, identifying a variety of objects ranging from background galaxies to supernova remnants to foreground stars.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

(Nanowerk Spotlight) Sp 2 -bonded carbon nanomaterials – such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene – have attracted enormous research interest over the past decades. Due to their superior intrinsic physical properties, such as mechanical strength, electrical and thermal conductivity, these nanocarbons find numerous applications in areas such as catalysis, energy storage or nanocomposites. In addition to these intrinsic physical properties, what makes these materials so attractive are their tunable chemical characters, such as functional groups, doping, and surface modification.

However, the demonstration of their intrinsic physical properties and performances in as-fabricated materials and practical devices has been suffering from the self-aggregation and re-stacking of nanocarbon materials due to strong van der Waals interactions. This prevents the full utilization of the active sites for catalytic reactions.

Researchers consider the rational combination of CNTs and graphene into three-dimensional (3D) hybrids an effective route to amplify the inherent physical properties at the macroscale. From post-treatment methods to in situ growth, various strategies have been explored to fabricate such CNTs/graphene hybrids. Most of these approaches, though, still require barrier layers, which hinders the full demonstration of the excellent properties of these hybrid materials.

By in situ nitrogen doping and structural hybridization of carbon nanotubes and graphene, a team from Tsinghua University, led by professors Qiang Zhang and Fei Wei, have now successfully fabricated nitrogen-doped aligned carbon nanotube/graphene (N-ACNT/G) sandwiches. In this work, aligned CNTs and graphene layers were anchored to each other, constructing a sandwich-like hierarchical architecture with efficient 3D electron transfer pathways and ion diffusion channels.

The researchers have published their findings in Advanced Materials ("Nitrogen-Doped Aligned Carbon Nanotube/Graphene Sandwiches: Facile Catalytic Growth on Bifunctional Natural Catalysts and Their Applications as Scaffolds for High-Rate Lithium-Sulfur Batteries").

(This article appeared in Invention & Technology magazine, Summer 2000 www.americanheritage.com and I highly recommend the magazine

One of the most versatile and familiar products of American chemical engineering, Teflon, was discovered by accident. There are many such tales to be found in the history of industrial chemistry, from vulcanized rubber to saccharin to Post-Its, all of which were stumbled upon by researchers looking for other things. So common, in fact, are unplanned discoveries of this sort that one might expect would-be inventors to simply mix random chemicals all day long until they come up with something valuable. Yet the circumstances behind the Teflon story show how each step along the way drew on the skills and talents of workers who were trained to nurture such discoveries and take them from the laboratory to the market. Teflon was developed at Du Pont, the source of many twentieth-century chemical innovations. It came about as a byproduct of the firm’s involvement with refrigerants. In the early 1930s a pair of General Motors chemists, A. L. Henne and Thomas Midgley, brought samples of two compounds to the Jackson Laboratory at Du Pont’s Chambers Works in Deepwater, New Jersey. The compounds, called Freon 11 and Freon 12, were chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)—hydrocarbons in which some or all of the hydrogen was replaced with chlorine or fluorine. GM’s research laboratories had developed the family of Freons for its Frigidaire division, which made refrigeration equipment. They were meant to replace existing refrigerants such as ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and propane, which were less efficient than Freons and either too poisonous or too explosive for residential use.

Having made the basic discovery, GM teamed up with Du Pont to take advantage of the latter’s expertise in manufacturing and research and development. The two companies formed a joint venture called Kinetic Chemicals, which by the mid-1930s had isolated and tested a wide range of CFCs and put the most promising ones into mass production. The best seller was refrigerant 114 (later called Freon 114), or retrafluorodichloroethane (CF 2 C l CF 2 C l ). Kinetic had agreed to reserve its entire output of Freon 114 for Frigidaire, so in the late 1930s Du Pont was looking for an equally effective refriger

<|begin_of_text|>A group of researchers led by Dr Stuart Licht of George Washington University has developed a novel method to economically convert atmospheric carbon dioxide directly into highly valued carbon nanofibers.

“We have found a way to use atmospheric carbon dioxide to produce high-yield carbon nanofibers. Such nanofibers are used to make strong carbon composites, such as those used in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, as well as in high-end sports equipment, wind turbine blades and a host of other products,” Dr Licht explained.

Because of its efficiency, the new process can be run using only a few volts of electricity, sunlight and a whole lot of carbon dioxide.

At its root, the system uses electrolytic syntheses to make the nanofibers.

Carbon dioxide is broken down in a high-temperature electrolytic bath of molten carbonates at 1,380 degrees Fahrenheit (750 degrees Celsius). Atmospheric air is added to an electrolytic cell.

“Once there, carbon dioxide dissolves when subjected to the heat and direct current through electrodes of nickel and steel. The carbon nanofibers build up on the steel electrode, where they can be removed,” Dr Licht said.

To power the syntheses, heat and electricity are produced through a hybrid and extremely efficient concentrating solar-energy system.

The system focuses the Sun’s rays on a photovoltaic solar cell to generate electricity and on a second system to generate heat and thermal energy, which raises the temperature of the electrolytic cell.

The scientists estimate electrical energy costs of this ‘solar, thermal, electrochemical process’ to be around $1,000 per ton of carbon nanofiber product, which means the cost of running the system is hundreds of times less than the value of product output.

“We calculate that with a physical area less than 10% the size of the Sahara Desert, our process could remove enough carbon dioxide to decrease atmospheric levels to those of the pre-industrial revolution within ten years,” Dr Licht said.

At this time, the system is experimental. “We are scaling up quickly and soon should be in range of making tens of grams of nanofibers an hour,” Dr Licht said.

One advance the researchers have recently achieved is the ability to synthesize carbon fibers using even less energy than when the process was initially developed.

“Carbon nanofiber growth can occur at less than 1 volt at 1,380 degrees Fahrenheit (750 degrees Celsius), which for example is much less than the 3-5 volts used in the 1,832 degrees Fahrenheit

It is the Democratic Republic of the Congo's largest source of export income. In 2009, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) had an estimated $24 trillion in untapped mineral deposits, including the world's largest reserves of coltan and significant quantities of the world's cobalt.[1][2] The United States Geological Survey estimates that the DRC has 1 million tons of lithium resources.[3]

During the Second Congo War mass-scale looting of mineral assets by all combattant forces—Congolese, Rwandan, Ugandan and foreign civilians—took place. The small artisanal mining operations the fighters were robbing sometimes shut down afterwards and larger foreign businesses reduced operations as well. Following the peace accord in 2003, the focus returned to mining. Rebel groups supplied international corporations through unregulated mining by soldiers, locals organized by military commanders and by foreign nationals. The political framework was unstable. In 2009 the DRC signed a loan contract with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for $12 billion of debt relief in 2010. The loan included trade conditions, such as liberalization of the diamond trade.[citation needed] At the end of 2012 the IMF suspended the last payments, because of a lack of transparency in the DRC's process for awarding mining contracts. The mining sector has since expanded, but commodity prices have declined and this has hampered the DRC's progress.

Much mining has been done in small artisanal mining operations, sometimes known as Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (ASM).[4] These small-scale mines are unregulated,[5] with high levels of child labor and workplace injury. They can occur within protected areas, and around endangered or threatened species. As of 2008 many ASM operations existed for minerals such as coltan.[citation needed] ASM operations employ a significant portion of the DRC's population; estimates range up to one fifth of the population, or 12.5 million people.[5] Problems stemming from artisanal mining include disruption of families, mining-related illnesses, environmental damage, child labor, prostitution and rape.[6][7]

More than 100 planetary scientists narrowed down a list of 21 sites with a vote at the conclusion of a 3-day workshop in Monrovia, California. The researchers were keen to find sites that could preserve signs of life in rocks which would be sampled by the rover and, they hope, eventually returned to Earth.

The top vote getter was Jezero crater, which contains a relic river delta that could have concentrated and preserved organic molecules. “The appeal is twofold,” says Bethany Ehlmann, a planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena. “Not only is there a delta, but the rocks upstream are varied and diverse.”

Second on the list was Columbia Hills, a region explored by the rover Spirit before it expired in 2010. Spirit found silica deposits that may have been deposited by a hydrothermal system—one that could have nourished life billions of years ago.

Several other favored sites sit at the edge of Isidis Basin, an impact structure that created deep troughs with significant carbonate deposits, which could help explain how Mars lost its once-thick carbon dioxide atmosphere. That atmosphere “was either lost to space, or it has to be sequestered down in the rock as carbonates,” Ehlmann says. “We can explore one of those paths.”

The new $1.5 billion rover will be very similar to Curiosity, which has been exploring Gale crater since 2012. But there are key differences. The main one is that the 2020 rover is expected to drill and collect more than 30 pencil-sized rock cores to be stored in a sample “cache.” Later missions could then land a small rover that would fetch and deliver the cache to a rocket that would return the samples to Earth for analysis.

The 2020 rover also has a slimmed down payload compared to Curiosity. It won’t have, for instance, a mass spectrometer analysis instrument of the type that has at times bogged down Curiosity. That should enable mission scientists to assemble a cache more quickly. The “sky crane” system, which delivered Curiosity to the surface, will also be used again, though engineers are considering enhancements that could allow zones of confident targeting to shrink by more than 50%, to ellipses as small as 13 kilometers by 7 kilometers.

Not to be confused with Peon

A paean () is a song or lyric poem expressing triumph or thanksgiving. In classical antiquity, it is usually performed by a chorus, but some examples seem intended for an individual voice (monody). It comes from the Greek παιάν (also παιήων or παιών), "song of triumph, any solemn song or chant." "Paeon" was also the name of a divine physician and an epithet of Apollo.[1]

Etymology [ edit ]

The basis of the word παιάν is *παιάϝων.[2] Its ultimate etymology is unclear. R. S. P. Beekes has suggested the meaning "who heals illnesses through magic," from *παῖϝα/*παϝία "blow", related to παίω "beat" (from Proto-Indo-European *ph 2 u-ie/o-) or παύω "withhold" (of uncertain etymology). He alternatively suggested that paian "may well be Pre-Greek."[3]

Ancient Greek paean [ edit ]

In Homer, Paeon[2] was the Greek physician of the gods. In Iliad V he heals the wounded Ares and Hades with his herbal lore. In time Paeon (or Paean) became an epithet of Apollo as a god capable of bringing disease and propitiated as a god of healing. Hesiod identifies Paeon as a separate god, and in later poetry Paeon is invoked independently as a health god. Later, Paean becomes an epithet of Asclepius, another healer-god.[4]

The earliest appearances of a paean or hymn of thanksgiving also appear in the Iliad. After the prayer to avert evil from the Achaeans, a paean is sung. In an almost identical line (X.391) that suggests a formulaic expression, Achilles tells the Myrmidons to sing the paean after the death of Hector.[5]

To discover the relation between Paean or Paeon, the healer-god, and paean in the sense of "song," it is necessary to identify the connection between ritual chant and the shaman's healing arts.[6]

The idea that liquid water exists below the surface of one of Saturn’s moons has been given a boost thanks to researchers in the US and China who have detected ammonia, various organic compounds, and possibly argon in plumes of gas and ice particles that spew out of the moon’s south pole.

The work should help scientists further understand the formation of this and other planetary bodies and keeps hope alive that Enceladus, Saturn’s sixth largest moon, might have the necessary components to support extraterrestrial life.

When plumes of ice water were first observed erupting from Enceladus by NASA’s Cassini spacecraft in 2005, scientists immediately began to wonder if they were being propelled by liquid water present in the moon’s interior. Now, Jack Hunter Waite Jr and colleagues from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, US, and a number of other institutions in the US and Taiwan have added to mounting evidence in support of this theory by analysing INMS (ion neutral mass spectrometer) data on the plumes’ gas constituents obtained from a recent Cassini flyby.

’Our evidence [for liquid water] comes from the detection of ammonia which acts as an antifreeze and can lower the melting point of water ice,’ explains Jonathan Lunine, one of the paper’s co-authors and a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson, US.

Moreover, the team believe their analysis points to an abundance of an isotope of argon (40Ar) in the plumes. The most plausible explanation for its presence, they say, is that a fluid must be leaching either the 40Ar or its parent potassium out of the rock deep inside Enceladus’ interior. ’Ice doesn’t do that so it really should be liquid,’ adds Lunine.

Growing support

Last month, German scientists, led by Frank Postberg from the University of Heidelberg, put forward strong evidence for subsurface liquid water by publishing their discovery of sodium salts in Saturn’s outer-most ring which is thought to originate from Enceladus’ plume material. ’The two studies are complimentary and now, for the first time, we are getting an idea of the full picture of what’s happening on Enceladus,’ says Postberg.

<|begin_of_text|>Physicists have long wondered whether hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, could be transformed into a metal and possibly even a superconductor -- the elusive state in which electrons can flow without resistance.

They have speculated that under certain pressure and temperature conditions hydrogen could be squeezed into a metal and possibly even a superconductor, but proving it experimentally has been difficult. High-pressure researchers, including Carnegie's Ho-kwang (Dave) Mao, have now modeled three hydrogen-dense metal alloys and found there are pressure and temperature trends associated with the superconducting state -- a huge boost in the understanding of how this abundant material could be harnessed.

The study is published in the January 25, 2010, early, on-line edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

All known materials have to be cooled below a very low, so-called, transition temperature to become superconducting, making them impractical for widespread application. Scientists have found that in addition to chemical manipulation to raise the transition temperature, superconductivity can also be induced by high pressure. Theoretical modeling is very helpful in defining the characteristics and pressures that can lead to high transition temperatures. In this study, the scientists modeled basic properties from first principles -- the study of behavior at the atomic level -- of three metal hydrides under specific temperature, pressure, and composition scenarios. Metal hydrides are compounds in which metals bind to an abundance of hydrogen in a lattice structure. The compounds were scandium trihydride (ScH 3 ), yttrium trihydride (YH 3 ) and lanthanum trihydride (LaH 3 ).

"We found that superconductivity set in at pressures between roughly 100,000 to 200,000 times atmospheric pressure at sea level (10 to 20 GPa), which is an order of magnitude lower than the pressures for related compounds that bind with four hydrogens instead of three," remarked Mao, of Carnegie's Geophysical Laboratory. Lanthanum trihydride stabilized at about 100,000 atmospheres and a transition temperature of -- 423°F (20 Kelvin), while the other two stabilized at about 200,000 atmospheres and temperatures of -427 °F (18 K) and -387 °F (40 K) for ScH 3 and YH 3 respectively.

The researchers also found that two of the compounds, LaH 3 and YH 3, had more similar distributions of vibrational energy to

A new look at data from the Mars Viking landers concludes that the two landers may have found the building blocks of life on the Red Planet after all way back in 1976. The surprise discovery of perchlorates by the Phoenix mission on Mars 32 years later could mean the way the Viking experiment was set up actually would have destroyed any carbon-based chemical building blocks of life – what the experiment set about to try and find.

“This doesn’t say anything about the question of whether or not life has existed on Mars, but it could make a big difference in how we look for evidence to answer that question,” said Chris McKay of NASA’s Ames Research Center. McKay coauthored a study published online by the Journal of Geophysical Research – Planets, reanalyzing results of Viking’s tests for organic chemicals in Martian soil.

The Viking lander scooped up some soil, put it in a tiny oven and heated the sample. The only organic chemicals identified in the Martian soil from that experiment chloromethane and dichloromethane — chlorine compounds interpreted at the time as likely contaminants from cleaning fluids used on the spacecraft before it left Earth. But those chemicals are exactly what the new study found when a little perchlorate — the surprise finding from Phoenix — was added to desert soil from Chile containing organics and analyzed in the manner of the Viking tests.

“Our results suggest that not only organics, but also perchlorate, may have been present in the soil at both Viking landing sites,” said the study’s lead author, Rafael Navarro-González of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City.

The Viking experiment results have been rather controversial over the years. There are some scientists who say the experiment actually did find evidence for life, and others who say the results were inconclusive.

McKay said that organics can come from non-biological or biological sources. Many meteorites raining onto Mars and Earth for the past 5 billion years contain organics. Even if Mars has never had life, scientists before Viking anticipated that Martian soil would contain organics from meteorites.

“The lack of organics was a big surprise from the Vikings,” McKay said. “But for 30 years we were looking at a jigsaw puzzle with a piece missing. Phoenix has provided the missing piece: perchlorate. The perchlorate discovery by Phoenix was one of the most important results from Mars since Viking.” Perchlorate, an ion of chlorine and oxygen, becomes a strong oxidant when heated. “

El estómago es el órgano dónde se realiza la digestión de los alimentos gracias a la secreción de jugos gástricos que disuelven lo que hemos comido para que sea mucho más fácil absorber las vitaminas y minerales por el intestino delgado.

Este órgano, para proteger sus paredes de los ácidos corrosivos de los que están compuestos los jugos gástricos, tiene una capa de mucosidad gástrica que evita dicha acción. Cuando esta capa se debilita, los ácidos inflaman e irritan las paredes estomacales creando lo que llamamos gastritis, la cual se puede curar de forma natural con el adecuado tratamiento.

La Gastritis es una enfermedad muy común y se ha contabilizado que al menos un 10% de la población la sufren o la han sufrido alguna vez en su vida.

Causas naturales de la gastritis

Una de las principales causas es la infección por una bacteria llamada Helicobacter Pylori. Dicha bacteria incide sobre la mucosa gástrica produciendole un daño, de esta manera los ácidos penetran y dañan las paredes del estómago. Este parásito es el causante de un 80% de los casos de úlceras duodenales y gástricas.

Henry Cavendish FRS (; 10 October 1731 – 24 February 1810) was an English natural philosopher, scientist, and an important experimental and theoretical chemist and physicist. He is noted for his discovery of hydrogen, which he termed "inflammable air".[1] He described the density of inflammable air, which formed water on combustion, in a 1766 paper, On Factitious Airs. Antoine Lavoisier later reproduced Cavendish's experiment and gave the element its name.

A notoriously shy man (it has been postulated that he had what is now called childhood autism in the ICD-10),[2] Cavendish was nonetheless distinguished for great accuracy and precision in his researches into the composition of atmospheric air, the properties of different gases, the synthesis of water, the law governing electrical attraction and repulsion, a mechanical theory of heat, and calculations of the density (and hence the mass) of the Earth. His experiment to measure the density of the Earth has come to be known as the Cavendish experiment.

Biography [ edit ]

Early life [ edit ]

Henry Cavendish was born on 10 October 1731 in Nice, where his family was living at the time. His mother was Lady Anne de Grey, fourth daughter of Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Kent, and his father was Lord Charles Cavendish, the third son of William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire. The family traced its lineage across eight centuries to Norman times, and was closely connected to many aristocratic families of Great Britain. Henry's mother died in 1733, three months after the birth of her second son, Frederick, and shortly before Henry's second birthday, leaving Lord Charles Cavendish to bring up his two sons.

From the age of 11 Henry attended Newcome's School, a private school near London. At the age of 18 (on 24 November 1748) he entered the University of Cambridge in St Peter's College, now known as Peterhouse, but left three years later on 23 February 1751 without taking a degree (at the time, a common practice).[3][4] He then lived with his father in London, where he soon had his own laboratory.

Lord Charles Cavendish spent his life firstly in politics and then increasingly in science, especially in the Royal Society

Microwaves are radio waves with frequencies ranging from around 300 million cycles per second (300 MHz) to 3 GHz. RF. A standard measure of exposure for microwave energy is the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) or rate of tissue energy absorption measured in watts per kilogram of tissue.

Microwave radiation leakage can damage human cells and tissues.

All appliances working on electricity produce a toxic electromagnetic field (EMF) of approximately 60 hertz. This is over and above potential microwave leakage from appliances or devices.

Microwave ovens can leak

Microwave leakage is serious enough that the FDA sets strict limits on it for the manufacturers. But once door seals age, leaking tends to exceed those limits, often at head level. That’s bad news, because the microwave energy inside a microwave oven is massive!

Frequency inside your microwave 2.45 BILLION hertz.

Frequency shown to start harming the human body: over 10 hertz

That’s 2.45 billion vs. 10 hertz. It doesn’t take very big leak for the damage to begin. (One top culprit: aging door seals)

The facts about microwaves & cataracts

Eyes are especially vulnerable to microwaves. That’s because unlike other areas of the body, they lack the blood vessels to dissipate the heat and cellular stress.

The first suspected clinical case of microwave-caused cataracts was reported by Hirsch and Parker as early as 1950's. (Sulman 1980).

For decades, cataracts have been reported in workers exposed to this type of radiation. (On the back of the lens where radiation cataracts usually occur.)

What do microwaves do to food?

In a microwave oven, alternating current forces atoms reverse polarity at a startlingly high rate. This creates such violent friction that the water inside the food molecules begin to vibrate and heat up.

The dangers of microwaved foods.

Microwaves break chemical and molecular bonds, and can literally rip atoms apart, disrupting the basic biochemical structures of life. It’s no wonder foods cooked in such a way become so harmful to consume.Government and industry studies suggest they pose no threat, but a growing body of knowledge now contradicts those claims.

Microwaved foods lose nutrition.

The Swiss scientist Hans Hertel, was the first to study microwave dangers, specifically, how cooking degrades and depletes food of nutrients—an effect that shows up in study participants' blood samples.

<|begin_of_text|>Currently, Mars has a thin atmosphere dominated by carbon dioxide, with pressures at most of the planet's surface so low that liquid water will immediately boil. But a variety of features we've discovered argue that the planet has once supported copious amounts of water, indicating that the planet's atmosphere must have differed considerably in the past. Using radar data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, scientists have now found a potential resting place for some material that was once in the Martian atmosphere: a huge deposit at the south pole that holds nearly as much CO 2 as the planet's current atmosphere.

Mars' south pole has extensive ice deposits, but most of that material is thought to be water, with only a thin coating of carbon dioxide on top. However, the MRO's radar instrument identified several reflection-free zones, where most of the radar signal went entirely through the icy material to the planet's surface itself. Based on the authors' calculations, this can't be water ice, but it does have very similar reflective properties to dry ice, or frozen carbon dioxide. The area also has features that indicate that some of the dry ice has sublimated to a gaseous form, resulting in areas where the surface has collapsed.

If the area is dry ice, then the total amount present is huge. The authors estimate the total volume of the non-reflective material at somewhere between 9,500 and 12,500 cubic kilometers. That's 30 times more than had previously been estimated to reside at the poles, and is about 80 percent of the current CO 2 content of the entire atmosphere. If all the dry ice were heated up, Mars' atmospheric pressure would nearly double.

Like the Earth, Mars undergoes orbital variations that alter the distribution of sunlight across the planet. One of these involves changes in the orientation of its axis of rotation relative to the plane of its orbit, called the obliquity. Mars undergoes more dramatic changes in obliquity than Earth and, as a result, its poles see more significant changes in sunlight at the extreme. The authors argue that this can help explain why the reflection-free zones lack any material from the planet's famous dust storms, which should reflect the radar effectively.

Mars' atmosphere needs to be above a certain density to support the particles that make up its dust storms. As the poles undergo extended cold periods, the authors suggest "the atmosphere collapses onto the polar caps." So much of the planet's dry ice winds up frozen at the poles that the atmosphere becomes even thinner than

Introduction

A whiff of pool water - often described as the smell of chlorine -can stir happy thoughts of summer. If strong enough, however, "pool smell" can signify a source of irritation to the eyes, lungs and skin of swimmers.

Pool smell is due, not to chlorine, but to chloramines, chemical compounds that build up in pool water when it is improperly treated.

Chloramines result from the combination of two ingredients: (a) chlorine disinfectants and (b) perspiration, oils and urine that enter pools on the bodies of swimmers. Chlorine disinfectants are added to pool water to destroy germs that can give swimmers diarrhea, ear aches and athlete's foot. Perspiration, oils and urine, however, are unwanted additions to pool water. By showering before entering the pool, and washing these substances from the skin, swimmers can help minimize pool smell.

The Chemistry of Pool Smell

When chlorine disinfectants are added to water, two chemicals are unleashed that destroy waterborne germs: hypochlorous acid, HOCl, and hypochlorite ion, OCl-. A measure of the chlorine in these two chemicals is known as "free available chlorine" or FAC. Pool operators manage the FAC level of pool water for the safety of swimmers. Their challenge comes from the fact that FAC is reduced when it reacts with perspiration, oils and urine from swimmers to form chloramines.

Three hydrogen ions are found

at the corners of the base of

this pyramid-shaped molecule,

with nitrogen at the top.

One way that chloramines are formed in pool water is by the reaction of hypochlorous acid with ammonia. Ammonia, NH 3, is a component of sweat and urine. Its chemical structure is illustrated in the figure at the right.

There are three chemical reactions that can occur when hypochlorous acid reacts with ammonia, each involving the replacement of hydrogen ions with chlorine ions. When one of ammonia's hydrogen ions is replaced with chlorine, monochloramine is formed:

HOCl + NH 3 → NH 2 Cl + H 2 O

Replacing one more hydrogen ion with chlorine produces dichloramine,

HOCl + NH 2 Cl → NHCl 2 + H 2 O

Finally, it is possible to replace all three of ammonia's hydrogen ions with chlorine to form trichloramine, also known as nitrogen trichloride:

HOCl + NHCl

CRISPR-Cas9, the genome editing technique discovered in 2014, is at the forefront of this newfound potential for innovation. These advancements provide an opportunity to solve problems in food supply, disease, genetics, and—the most tantalizing and forbidden of prospects—modifying the human genome. Doing so would make us better, faster, stronger, more resilient, and more intelligent: it’s a chance to engineer ourselves at a faster rate than natural selection could ever dream.

However, many experts warn of the dangers of these new capabilities. A vast torrent of money is flowing towards biotech startups, and the race to be first can encourage cutting corners. Researchers in 2017 resurrected an extinct strain of the horsepox virus. CRISPR may make it possible to create the bioweapons carefully safeguarded by the US and Russian governments, such as smallpox, or to take an existing disease, like Ebola, and modify it into an epidemiologist’s worst nightmare.

With these mind-bending breakthroughs that seem like science fiction, it can be a near-impossible task to discern hype from reality. Yet this is a crucial task for our politicians—who are overwhelmingly not scientists—to undertake. How can we realistically assess the potential risks and rewards? Now, a new study combining researchers from the US and the UK, published recently in eLifeSciences, gives an expert perspective on 20 emerging issues in bioengineering.

The researchers sorted the 20 developments into different time horizons: the next five years, the next decade, and more than a decade away. In the next five years, they anticipate breakthroughs in artificial photosynthesis. As plants can turn carbon dioxide into fuel, artificial photosynthesis could be crucial for the energy crisis and to tackle climate change. While any scheme to deploy carbon dioxide removal as a climate fix would have to be huge, recent studies have shown that artificial photosynthesis can reduce CO 2 more efficiently than plants and can convert it into methanol for fuel.

We’re running out of farming space as the world’s population continues to grow; to feed the world, a new Green Revolution may be necessary. Enhancing natural photosynthesis through genetic modification may prove to be the answer, as the C4 gene is being engineered into rice. Since this gene could boost rice yields by up to 50 percent, and since rice provides hundreds of millions with most of their calories, it’s a huge potential development.

Scientists from Oxford University investigated the compositions of Martian meteorites found on Earth and data from NASA’s ‘Spirit’ rover that examined surface rocks in the Gusev crater on Mars. The fact that the surface rocks are five times richer in nickel than the meteorites was puzzling and had cast doubt on whether the meteorites are typical volcanic products of the red planet.

‘What we have shown is that both meteorites and surface volcanic rocks are consistent with similar origins in the deep interior of Mars but that the surface rocks come from a more oxygen-rich environment, probably caused by recycling of oxygen-rich materials into the interior,’ said Professor Bernard Wood, of Oxford University’s Department of Earth Sciences, who led the research reported in this week’s Nature.

‘This result is surprising because while the meteorites are geologically ‘young’, around 180 million to 1400 million years old, the Spirit rover was analysing a very old part of Mars, more than 3700 million years old.’

Whilst it is possible that the geological composition of Mars varies immensely from region to region the researchers believe that it is more likely that the differences arise through a process known as subduction – in which material is recycled into the interior. They suggest that the Martian surface was oxidised very early in the history of the planet and that, through subduction, this oxygen-rich material was drawn into the shallow interior and recycled back to the surface during eruptions 4000 million years ago. The meteorites, by contrast, are much younger volcanic rocks that emerged from deeper within the planet and so were less influenced by this process.

Professor Wood said: ‘The implication is that Mars had an oxygen-rich atmosphere at a time, about 4000 million years ago, well before the rise of atmospheric oxygen on earth around 2500 million years ago. As oxidation is what gives Mars its distinctive colour it is likely that the ‘red planet’ was wet, warm and rusty billions of years before Earth’s atmosphere became oxygen rich.’

A report of the research, entitled ‘Volcanism on Mars controlled by early oxidation of the upper mantle’, is published in the journal Nature. The research was carried out by James Tuff, Dr Jon Wade, and Professor Bernard Wood at Oxford University’s Department of Earth Sciences and was supported by the Science and Technology Facilities

<|begin_of_text|>"Our oceans are an unsafe place to live." When I first read this quote on World Animal Protection's website I was very perplexed. How can this be? How can the oceans be an unsafe place to live? Well, after a little more fishing, I found the answer is even worse. I'll come back to this point later.

The ocean is big, it's beautiful and it's the heart of our planet. It regulates the earth's climate, feeds hundreds of millions of people, is home to an abundance of wildlife and even gives us medicines to live longer, healthier lives.

But probably the most important factor is that the ocean gives us the oxygen we need to breathe through the miracle of photosynthesis. We NEED the ocean to breathe, it's really that simple! In fact, marine plants give us terra-firma dwellers 70 per cent of the oxygen we need to live. And, even though we know this, we are still polluting the atmosphere so much that the temperature and chemistry of the oceans are changing. We see this change most noticeably in Australia's Great Barrier Reef where fish are deprived of oxygen and plankton are having a really tough time making their shells. All of this leads to the mass bleaching of coral reefs in the area.

The situation is actually very dire, because along with what we are doing to the chemistry of the ocean, we are also making it a very unsafe place for marine life to live thanks to something called ghost gear.

Ghost gear is discarded, lost and abandoned fishing gear that makes the ocean a death trap for marine animals and it's why World Animal Protection has launched the Sea Change campaign.

We've all seen those heart breaking news stories about whales that become entangled and the courageous rescues that happen to try and save them. This is only a fraction of the impact ghost gear has on animals. This gear, which was designed to catch and kill animals, represents one of the biggest threats to sea life, accounts for about 10 per cent of the plastic garbage in the water and is found in every ocean and sea on the planet. It's a major problem that most people know very little about.

"The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) conservatively estimate that some 640,000 tonnes of fishing gear are left in our oceans each year. In just one deep water fishery in the north-east Atlantic some 25,000 nets, totalling around 1,250 km in length, were recorded lost

<|begin_of_text|>The gustatory system creates the human sense of taste, allowing us to perceive different flavors from substances that we consume as food and drink. Gustation, along with olfaction (the sense of smell), is classified as chemoreception. Because it functions by reacting with molecular chemical compounds in a given substance. Specialized cells in the gustatory system that are located on the tongue are called taste buds, and they sense tastants (taste molecules). The taste buds send the information after coming in contact with food from the tastants to the brain, where a molecule is processed as a certain taste. There are five main tastes: bitter, salty, sweet, sour, and umami (savory). All the varieties of flavor we experience are a combination of some or all of these tastes.

The sense of taste is transduced by taste buds. Which are clusters of 50-100 taste receptor cells located in the tongue, soft palate, epiglottis, pharynx, and esophagus. The tongue is the main sensory organ of the gustatory system. The tongue contains papillae, or specialized epithelial cells, which have taste buds on their surface. There are three types of papillae with taste buds in the human gustatory system:

Loading...

fungiform papillae, which are mushroom-shaped and located at the tip of the tongue;

foliate papillae, which are ridges and grooves toward the back of the tongue;

circumvallate papillae, which are circular-shaped and located in a row just in front of the end of the tongue.

You can’t taste food unless it’s mixed with your saliva

Each taste bud is flask-like in shape and formed by two types of cells: supporting cells and gustatory cells. Gustatory cells are short-lived and are continuously regenerating. They each contain a taste pore at the surface of the tongue which is the site of sensory transduction. Though there are small differences in sensation, all taste buds, no matter their location, can respond to all types of taste.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Last night, the gaming website Polygon reported on a study from the American Psychological Association that concluded there was a link between violent games and aggression. “The research demonstrates a consistent relation between violent video game use and increases in aggressive behavior, aggressive cognitions and aggressive affect, and decreases in prosocial behavior, empathy and sensitivity to aggression,” read the report.

But a closer look at the APA’s study (pdf) leads to a number of questions—many of the same questions Kotaku asked in January of 2013, when we ran an extensive look at the current state of research on video game violence.

Some context: the APA study, which was published yesterday, is not based on new research but instead is a review of studies conducted between 2005 and 2013. In addition to looking through several individual journals, researchers with the APA scrutinized four meta-analyses—reports that look at wide swaths of research and try to spot patterns—and ultimately concluded that there is indeed a pattern of test subjects growing more aggressive after they play violent video games.

There are serious problems with the study, though—problems we’ve pointed out in the past. Let’s go over a few.

1) How do you even measure aggression?

An outside observer might wonder—how can you tell whether someone is “more aggressive”? Is there really a way to measure an emotional state like aggression? Well, some of the tests used in violent video game studies include:

A) The “short story” test, where a subject is given the beginning of a writing prompt (“A driver crashes into Bob’s car. Bob gets out of his car and approaches the driver.”) and told to fill in what happens next.

B) The “noise” test, where a subject is asked to press a button that delivers a terrible sound to another subject, then evaluated based on how much noise they deliver and how intense it is.

C) The “hot sauce” test, where a subject is asked to dole out hot sauce to another subject and is evaluated based on how much sauce they give and how spicy it is.

Other tests ask subjects to fill out questionnaires asking how aggressive they feel, and if all this has you raising an eyebrow, you’re not alone. “Aggression” is an ambiguous

These bands are formed by sheets of microscopic carbides within a tempered martensite or pearlite matrix in higher carbon steel, or by ferrite and pearlite banding in lower carbon steels. It was a pioneering steel alloy developed in Southern India in the 6th century BC and exported globally. It was also known in the ancient world by many different names including Ukku, Hindvi Steel, Hinduwani Steel, Teling Steel and Seric Iron.

History [ edit ]

Wootz steel originated in South India, in Tamilakam present day Tamil Nadu and Kerala.[1][2] There are several ancient Tamil, Greek, Chinese and Roman literary references to high carbon Tamil steel. The crucible steel production process started in the 6th century BC, at production sites of Kodumanal in Tamil Nadu, Golconda in Telangana, Karnataka and Sri Lanka and exported globally; the Tamils of the Chera Dynasty producing what was termed the finest steel in the world, i.e. Seric Iron to the Romans, Egyptians, Chinese and Arabs by 500 BC.[3][4][5] The steel was exported as cakes of steely iron that came to be known as "Wootz".[6] Wootz steel in India had high amount of carbon in it.

The Tamilakam method was to heat black magnetite ore in the presence of carbon in a sealed clay crucible inside a charcoal furnace to completely remove slag. An alternative was to smelt the ore first to give wrought iron, then heat and hammer it to remove slag. The carbon source was bamboo and leaves from plants such as Avārai.[6][7] The Chinese and locals in Sri Lanka adopted the production methods of creating wootz steel from the Chera Tamils by the 5th century BC.[8][9] In Sri Lanka, this early steel-making method employed a unique wind furnace, driven by the monsoon winds. Production sites from antiquity have emerged, in places such as Anuradhapura, Tissamaharama and Samanalawewa, as well as imported artifacts of ancient iron and steel from Kodumanal. A 200 BC Tamil trade guild in Tissamaharama, in the South East of Sri Lanka, brought with them some of the oldest iron and steel artifacts and production processes to the island from the classical period.[10][11][12][13]

<|begin_of_text|>Q: Most of Dion Waiters' minutes should go to Tyler Johnson. Dion is just not a player worth investing in. I'm sure he puts maximum effort. Some players have it and some just don't. -- Chris, Orlando.

A: These certainly are interesting times with the Heat, with Dion standing somewhat as the focus of the Heat's perimeter offense, be that because of other players deferring or Dion's confidence. Understand, after playing alongside Dwyane Wade, players such as Josh Richardson and Tyler Johnson have a certain natural inclination to defer. So you wind up with Dion getting the shot totals he has in the past two games (albeit in the absence of Goran Dragic), and taking the most meaningful shots against the Spurs and Hawks. And that's the fine line that Erik Spoelstra has to walk at this still-preliminary stage of the season: Do you put the ball in the hands of your young players and live with the consequences? Or do you go with the player who, at that moment, has the most confidence and experience in such situations. The Waiters situation is similar to the Heat's situation last season with Joe Johnson. There was talk about both continuing on with the team when the salary-cap reality going forward spoke otherwise. The difference at the end of last season with Johnson is that the Heat were admittedly living in the moment. Now it already appears that future moments are the priority.

Q: Haven't we seen all there is with Josh McRoberts over the years? He isn't a scorer. He is a flash-first player and hesitant to shoot even when wide open. His 3-point game is average and not enough to spread the floor. I guess I'm not seeing the upside or possibilities with Josh -- Paul, Fort Lauderdale.

A: Which is why I believe these current minutes are important, to finally get a read on what you have, to possibly showcase what you have, or to at least then know how to best move forward. This is not a team or an offense that can afford to have bystanders when it comes to scoring. Erik Spoelstra has been very good about issuing green lights, even insisting on it with players, such as Luke Babbitt. The Heat need offense. They need Josh McRoberts' offense. They should consider it almost insubordination if there is not an effort in that area.

Q: Hi, Ira. I see so many questions and comments about trading Goran Dragic right now. However, wouldn't it make

<|begin_of_text|>Portland General Store was founded by Lisa and Troy in 2007.

PGS products are made in America with vegan and organic ingredients. They use only essential oils in an organic base of cane sugar alcohol. Scents were inspired by old-fashioned recipes with no additives or chemicals in them.

They have a “Whiskey” shaving soap (though the scent is described as a cedarwood base) but I decided to try their “Racer” shaving cream. I get a mostly “medicinal” scent from the cream’s jar though (Lisa from Portland General describes it as “mostly vetiver, patchouli, sandalwood, and a few other EOs”).

Portland General’s web page says it can be applied with a brush but my attempts at lathering with a brush have been utterly futile. Massaging it in with fingers works fine though.

Performance is good: lubrication and cushion is entirely acceptable. But the combination of the scent and not being unable to use it with a shave brush make this a secondary product for me. I would use it if I was travelling or needed a quick, brushless shave.

<|begin_of_text|>Whether its a new drug, a new fertilizer or a new solar panel, chemists have been stuck using the same methods to make their inventions. Now, the Center for Selective C-H Functionalization, run by Emory University organic chemist Huw Davies, is breaking the mold.

“It is an entirely different way of putting molecules together,” Davies said. “And that means it allows you ready access to compounds that have either never been made before, or that were impractical to be made by the conventional methods.”

This international collaboration of scientists is redesigning how organic chemicals are made. Every organic chemical has a basic framework made up of carbon and hydrogen. When chemists make new drugs, for example, they build on those existing frameworks.

But what if you could break open that framework? You could build new chemical structures into the framework, Davies said, opening up new possibilities for drugs and other organic chemicals.

It will also make some chemicals cleaner and cheaper to make, said Daniel Morton, managing director of the Center for Selective C-H Functionalization. By changing how chemicals are made, scientists can eliminate toxic byproducts and waste.

“I think in every field of science one of the biggest drives in the last 20 years has been how to do things in a cleaner, more effective and efficient fashion,” he said. “And that’s what this center is all about.”
