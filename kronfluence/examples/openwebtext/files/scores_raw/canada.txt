The changes were outlined in a new constitution published in 2008 but the government had not announced a date for their introduction.

The country’s new name is the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, instead of the Union of Myanmar.

The military, which has ruled since a 1962 coup, changed the country’s name in English from Burma to Myanmar in 1989, a year after widespread protests against military rule were crushed, and a year before the last election.

That election was won by the party of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi but the military ignored the result. Suu Kyi has spent 15 of the past 21 years in detention.

The new flag has a horizontal band of light green at the top, dark green in the center and red at the bottom, with a white star in the middle. There has been no official explanation as to what the colors or the star represent.

Nor has there been any explanation as to why the changes, which include a new state seal, were being made.

Officials in various government departments told Reuters they were ordered to change the flags.

“We were caught by surprise when we got the order at short notice. There was also an order that the old flags must be burned,” said one official who declined to be identified.

The order stipulated that the old flag had to be lowered by someone born on a Tuesday and the new flag had to be raised by someone born on a Wednesday, he said.

“It must have been instructed by astrologers,” he said.

Myanmar’s secretive military rulers, who will retain ultimate power no matter who wins the November 7 parliamentary election, are widely believed to consult astrologers.

Several dozen passers-by watched the formal ceremony to change the flags at Yangon City Hall.

One, who declined to be identified, said the change was akin to putting old wine in new bottles: “The label has changed but what is really needed is a change of the wine.”<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

The proliferation of mega-churches might indicate that non-denominational Protestant evangelical Christianity is the answer, but it�s not. In fact, that group is shrinking and now represents fewer than half of Americans for the first time. It�s not Catholicism, or Mormonism, or even Islam either.

It�s None of the Above.

In 1990, about 7 percent of Americans indicated that they had no religious affiliation, according to a study last year by the University of California at Berkeley. By 2013, that figure had risen to about 20 percent.

Just to clarify, that figure doesn�t mean one out of every five people in this country had up and gone atheist. But it does indicate that a whole lot of people have become untethered from mainstream Christianity over the past two decades.

And it�s fast appearing that some of Christianity�s biggest boosters are to blame for its decline.

The alliance between Christianity and conservative politics is now so pervasive that it�s difficult to believe there was a time the two entities weren�t linked.

In fact, the first U.S. president to publicly admit having been a �born-again Christian� was one James Earl Carter, who was, politically speaking, more liberal than the so-called �Kenyan Muslim radical socialist� currently occupying the White House.

But by 1980, U.S. Christian religious leaders had fully thrown in with the Republican political right. And the arrangement has worked out pretty well for both sides ever since. At least until now.

In the past year, a whole host of polls and studies, including a poll of millennials, the hip new term to describe people born between the early 1980s and the early 2000s, done last month by Pew Research Center, indicates that the culture war � particularly opposition to marriage equality and abortion � is now helping neither Republicans nor Christians.

The math is simple, and dire, for both sides of that now-traditional alliance. Christians who embrace the Republican platform are migrating to the other side of the grass. Replacing them are a wave of millennials who are OK with gay marriage, pro-choice and in favor of marijuana legalization.

Only 10 years ago, President George W. Bush won his re-election campaign largely because his campaign strategists got anti-gay-marriage referenda placed on the ballots in key states, chiefly Ohio, which got Christians out to the polls. They stuck around long enough

Embarking on the next stage in taking its first product to market, Scanadu has partnered with Dr. Eric Topol at the Scripps Translational Science Institute to conduct clinical testing on the Scout device, a medical tricorder that measures a host of metrics like blood pressure and heart rate. Those trials are set to begin in Q1 of 2014.

While Scanadu is equipping the Scout with off-the-shelf sensors, each needs a 501(k) clearance from the FDA, as do any groups of sensors working in conjunction with each other. That’s the whole point of the Scout: it combines existing trackers into one handy device.

“This is a device that comes out of nothing,” Scanadu CEO Walter De Brouwer said. “There was nothing that you could build on. You put all sorts of sensors together in a small package and make it do stuff that it hasn’t done before.”

The goal is to have the commercial device available to consumers by the winter of 2014 or Q1 of 2015. Before that, the Scout will ship to the 8,000 people who preordered through the Indiegogo campaign in March. Scanadu will be doing usability testing on volunteers from that cohort in order to glean how exactly consumers will use the Scout: how many times a day they check it and what metrics they are most interested in tracking, for instance.

The Scout will work with a companion app, which functions as a medical record populated by data taken by the device. As consumers are encouraged to take a more active role in their health — especially with regard to disease prevention — it’s a way to look at various metrics over time.

The app can also provide recommendations on what tests people might want to pay closer attention to. If one person is checking his blood pressure and cholesterol, Scanadu can inform him that people checking those metrics are also watching their heart rate, and perhaps he should look at that, too.

“Infection was one of our old enemies. We now have that under control,” De Brouwer said. “The 21st century enemy is cardiovascular disease. Replacing the thermometer with a device that tests blood pressure, diastolic pressure, your ECG, heartrate, and records and analyzes that

Branded as America’s “worst employer in the national hotel industry,” Hyatt is accused of “replacing longtime employees with minimum wage temporary workers and imposing dangerous workloads on those who remain,” adding that “Hyatt housekeepers have high rates of injury.”

What incited the Hyatt workers, after years of silence, to finally confront their employer was when all the housekeepers at three non-unionized Hyatt hotels in Boston, Massachusetts – Hyatt Regency Boston, Hyatt Regency Cambridge, Hyatt Harborside – were arbitrarily fired (with no advance notice) and replaced by temporary workers on August 31, 2009.

Called “The Hyatt 100,” the dismissed workers – some of them had worked for Hyatt for over 20 years – earned widespread support from the public and civil society organizations, led by the unions, and even from various religious groups, politicians and businesses.

The Boston protests may have inspired workers in other Hyatt hotels in the US to later raise their grievances and assert their rights, including those in Chicago, Illinois; Indianapolis, Indiana; San Antonio, Texas; Scottsdale, Arizona; Santa Clara, San Francisco and Long Beach in California; and Seattle, Washington.

The hyatthurts.org website explained that Hyatt’s subcontracting is actually “destroying good jobs and exploiting immigrant workers,” who are either deceived or forced to take jobs with much lower pay and without security of tenure.

It added that Hyatt housekeeping staffs comprise one of the most abused hotel workers in the US. For instance, they had the highest injury rate among housekeepers, according to a study – on 50 hotel facilities from five different hotel firms – published by the American Journal of Industrial Medicine.

Housekeepers or room attendants at some Hyatts have also excessive workloads as they have to clean as many as 30 rooms a day or “as little as 15 minutes” per room. Violations of occupational safety and health standards are also increasing; thus, last year, 11 Hyatt hotels were slapped with 18 citations, and three against one of Hyatt’s housekeeping subcontractors.

» Can ferries play a useful role in the broader public transportation system?

Most major cities are situated along some body of water — usually a river or two, often a lake or the ocean. There’s a good reason for this: waterways played an important role historically as transportation links for people and freight. They also allowed connections across barriers insurmountable by ground-based transportation; in the early 1900s, for example, ferries were the only mode of transport between Manhattan and Northern New Jersey. But new technologies allowing the construction of underwater road and rail tunnels and the general improvement of ground-based transportation systems have reduced the importance of boats for the average commuter in the urban environment.

In some cities, of course, the ferry never died out as a transportation mode — Venice’s Vaporetto water bus continues to be the primary mode of transit in that pedestrian city; in North America, both Seattle and Vancouver have extensive operations because of their water-bound geography. But for the most part, cities that grew up around their respective rivers have come to ignore them as potential corridors for transit service, citing the slow speed of water-bound travel and the difficulty of getting from the waterfront to business or residential districts.

Yet the transformation of many inner-city waterfronts from industrial zones to parks surrounded by walkable dense neighborhoods has reawakened an interest in using boats for transportation operations. With water views and fresh air, water taxis could be an appealing alternative to more mainstream forms of transit. The news this week that a company called American River Taxi plans to begin transit operations later this year between several of Washington, D.C.’s major waterfront zones is only the latest example of such an initiative.

The Potomac Riverboat Company currently operates a route between Alexandria and National Harbor.

Boats provide a unique opportunity to improve urban transportation because their use requires very little construction spending: unlike trains or buses, they can take advantage of a natural resource to move about, rather than having to rely on a built rail or road route. The only capital expenses required are in the erection of ferry terminals and the purchase of the boats themselves. Replacing some ferry routes with bridges or tunnels for ground-based transportation would cost billions of dollars.

From this perspective, the investment in new boat routes between Georgetown, the Southwest Waterfront, the Navy Yard, Alexandria, and National Harbor could provide significant new connections to areas of the Washington region that don’t have direct transit links today. Each of these neighborhoods has seen significant redevelopment over the past decade, already

<|begin_of_text|>The Sims is a series of life simulation video games developed by Maxis and published by Electronic Arts. The franchise has sold nearly 200 million copies worldwide, and it is one of the best-selling video games series of all time.[1]

The games in the Sims series are largely sandbox games, in that they lack any defined goals (except for some later expansion packs and console versions which introduced this gameplay style). The player creates virtual people called "Sims" and places them in houses and helps direct their moods and satisfy their desires. Players can either place their Sims in pre-constructed homes or build them themselves. Each successive expansion pack and game in the series augmented what the player could do with their Sims.

Development [ edit ]

Will Wright

Game designer Will Wright was inspired to create a "virtual doll house" after losing his home during the Oakland firestorm of 1991 and subsequently rebuilding his life.[2][3] Replacing his home and his other possessions made him think about adapting that life experience into a game. When Wright initially took his ideas to the Maxis board of the directors, they were skeptical and gave little support or financing for the game. The directors at Electronic Arts, which bought Maxis in 1997, were more receptive—SimCity had been a great success for them, and they foresaw the possibility of building a strong Sim franchise.[2]

Wright has stated that The Sims was actually meant as a satire of U.S. consumer culture.[4] Wright took ideas from the 1977 architecture and urban design book A Pattern Language, American psychologist Abraham Maslow's 1943 paper A Theory of Human Motivation and his hierarchy of needs, and Charles Hampden-Turner's Maps of the Mind to develop a model for the game's artificial intelligence.[2]

"We weren't really making it too difficult on Americans," the Jeopardy! host joked.

The Canada 150 category on Jeopardy! included clues about the national anthem and the Quebec flag. (Jeopardy!)

Steven Patrick Morrissey (; born 22 May 1959), known mononymously as Morrissey, is an English singer, songwriter, and author. He came to prominence as the frontman of the Smiths, a rock band active from 1982 to 1987. Since then, he has pursued a commercially successful solo career. Morrissey's music is characterised by his baritone voice and distinctive lyrical content featuring recurring themes of emotional isolation and sexual longing, self-deprecating and black humour, and anti-establishment stances.

Born in Davyhulme, Lancashire, to a working-class Irish migrant family, Morrissey grew up in Manchester. As a child he developed a love of literature, kitchen sink realism, and pop music. In the late 1970s, he fronted punk rock band the Nosebleeds with little success before beginning a career in music journalism and authoring several books on music and film in the early 1980s. With Johnny Marr he formed the Smiths in 1982, soon attracting national recognition for their eponymous debut album. As the band's frontman, Morrissey attracted attention for his trademark quiff and witty and sardonic lyrics. Deliberately avoiding rock machismo, he cultivated the aesthetic of a sexually ambiguous social outsider who embraced celibacy. The Smiths released three further studio albums—Meat Is Murder, The Queen Is Dead, and Strangeways, Here We Come—and had a string of hit singles. The band were critically acclaimed and attracted a cult following. Personal differences between Morrissey and Marr resulted in the separation of the Smiths in 1987.

In 1988, Morrissey launched his solo career with Viva Hate. This album and its follow-ups—Kill Uncle, Your Arsenal, and Vauxhall and I—all did well on the UK Albums Chart and spawned multiple hit singles. Replacing Marr, he took on Alain Whyte and Boz Boorer as his primary co-writers. During this time his image began to shift into that of a burlier figure, who toyed with patriotic imagery and working-class masculinity. In the mid-to-late 1990s, his albums Southpaw Grammar and Maladjusted also charted but were less well received. Relocating to Los Angeles, he took a musical hiatus from 1998 to 2003 before releasing a successful comeback album

In a recent op-ed for The Xenia Gazette, Jamie Raskin, a professor of Constitutional Law at American University and Maryland State Senator who is currently running for U.S. Congress, notes that four of the U.S. Supreme Court’s justices are over the age of 80 and that the next president could have the chance to replace all of them.

"Will the new justices bolster the conservatives, who favor legislative power only when it violates minority rights, or the liberals, who have demonstrated a serious commitment both to voting rights and to the legislative process?"

“Will the new justices bolster the conservatives, who favor legislative power only when it violates minority rights, or the liberals, who have demonstrated a serious commitment both to voting rights and to the legislative process?”

Raskin decries the conservative dissents in the Obergefell v. Hodges same-sex marriage decision, singling out Scalia’s dissent for calling the ruling “a threat to American democracy.”

The phrase would have been more accurate, he said, had it been used in Citizens United, Shelby County v. Holder, or Bush v. Gore.

He argues that Scalia and Roberts “pose as outraged populists regarding marriage equality” who “pretend, ludicrously, that they don’t believe in the court reviewing and invalidating popularly enacted laws.” Yet they have “no problem with nullifying laws that implement affirmative action, produce majority-minority legislative districts, or exclude corporations from spending money in political campaigns.”

“What a joke,” Raskin wrote. “These so-called conservatives strike down almost any law that curtails the power of corporations. They just don’t like the idea of equal protection and due process applying to people.”

Raskin did not respond to Campus Reform’s request for comment.

Roberts, whose formal appeal of the result was rejected by the party executive Saturday, said the contest “contained highly suspect irregularities.” “There were clear indications of fraud undertaken,” he said in a statement, noting “the events that transpired here send a very dangerous and potentially damaging message about our cause.” Macgregor, a veteran Tory activist and the mother of Brown’s deputy chief of staff, could not be reached for comment.

“You should resign. You should give back the money you took while this scam was going on and you should be criminally investigated,” Warren told Stumpf, after he admitted under Warren’s grilling he hadn’t yet been held personally accountable for the actions of his employees.

The Democratic senator also forced Stumpf, who was under questioning from the Senate banking committee over his bank’s handling of the scam, to admit that no senior executives have been held accountable for the actions of the low-level bankers.

Some forged signatures and committed identity theft to open fraudulent bank accounts, while under pressure to meet sales targets or be fired. These employees, Stumpf explained earlier in the committee hearing, were “well-paid,” making between $30,000 and $60,000 a year. Stumpf made $19.3 million in 2015.

“This just isn’t right,” Warren said. “You squeezed employees to the breaking point” to drive up the stock price and your compensation, she said, referencing the bank’s fierce drive to “cross-sell” or make customers open up multiple accounts. “You went on television to blame thousands of $12-an-hour” workers.

“It’s gutless leadership,” Warren said.

Last week Stumpf in a televised interview appeared to blame low-level workers for this behavior, which was widespread throughout the bank ― 5,300 employees were fired for their involvement.

A cashier who “steals a handful of $20s” is held accountable, Warren said. Bank executives aren’t.

“The only way Wall Street will change will be if executives face jail time” for criminal behavior, she said.

In the Wells Fargo scandal, people were mistakenly charged fees, saw their credit ratings fall, got credit cards in the mail they never asked for or just were confused.

The bank said that it had fired the thousands of employees from 2011 to 2016 for engaging in the practice. Stumpf tried on Tuesday to make the case that this was a few bad apples, explaining the firings amounted to 1 percent of the bank’s 100,000 retail bankers every year.

The incentive to open fake accounts was strong: Wells Fargo bankers received quarterly bonuses for cross-selling. Stumpf said on Tuesday that the lowest-paid bank workers make $12 an hour

A Republican-led effort to repeal marriage equality in New Hampshire

decisively failed today. Lawmakers voted against the repeal, against

replacing marriage with civil unions, and against putting marriage

rights up to a voter referendum.

Just to ensure the message

was clear, Republican representative Seth Cohn, who supports marriage

equality, proposed banning marriage between left-handed people. That

didn't pass either.

The final vote was 211-116 to kill a bill

that would have rescinded marriage equality in the state, and the votes

against the repeal included several Republicans, such as Cohn, who

broke with their party.

Gov. John Lynch signed marriage equality

legislation in 2009 after it narrowly passed through the legislature,

and he has promised to veto any effort to repeal the law. It would have

needed to pass through both Republican-led chambers before reaching his

desk.

But the bill, introduced by state representative David

Bates, couldn't muster the votes to pass the House, let alone come

anywhere near the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto.

Bates had also sought a referendum but lost that vote 162-188. Polling on the issue showed that a solid majority of New Hampshire residents opposed rolling back marriage rights for gay residents. And marriage supporters argued that it was their role, not voters', to make a decision on repeal.

It wasn't the first time marriage opponents had tried to put the question on a ballot. House members voted against a similar initiative in 2010, failing to reach the 60% of members' votes to add the initiative to the ballot.

"Our opponents tried to abuse the 2010 Republican legislative sweep in New Hampshire to repeal the popular law," said Marc Solomon, Freedom to Marry’s national campaign director. "What they didn’t count on was the fact that the freedom to marry is becoming a bipartisan value, as resoundingly reflected in today’s vote."<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Did President Obama get the economics wrong earlier this month when he abandoned stricter air-quality rules, wagering environmentalist loyalty in a bid to avoid job losses from strict new ozone standards? Paul Krugman thinks so, calling the decision to wave off the EPA a “lousy decision all around.” But is Krugman right?

The short-run job-creating move, Krugman contends, would have been for Obama to promulgate the new ozone regulations, which would have forced firms in hundreds of counties across the country to replace and upgrade capital in order to comply with new, stringent pollution abatement requirements. He asserts that because the U.S. economy is in a liquidity trap, wherein conventional monetary policy is insufficient to induce firms to spend, the regulations could have accomplished what the Fed cannot. In such a “world of topsy-turvy,” as Krugman says, the usual rules of economics are thrown out, and even the “Broken Window Fallacy” ceases to hold.

The 19th century French theorist Frederic Bastiat cautioned against concluding that a shopkeeper’s broken window is a good thing because it induces him to employ a glazier to repair the window. Such a conclusion ignores that which is unseen: that the shopkeeper would have employed the shoemaker to replace his worn out shoes had the window not been broken. Hence, the broken window doesn’t increase employment or grow wealth. In fact, it shrinks wealth, leaving the shopkeeper worse off than if he had been able to replace his worn out shoes for the cost of the new window. The deliberate destruction of windows, then, would assuredly be poor economic policy in normal times because it trades wealth-creating spending for wealth-replacing spending.

But what happens in unusual times, like those of a liquidity trap? Krugman contends that shopkeepers are sitting on stockpiles of cash and not spending. So the shopkeeper’s expenditures to replace broken windows won’t crowd out expenditures on shoes since he wasn’t going to purchase shoes in the short run anyway. So, too, Krugman reasons, forced investments on pollution abatement won’t crowd out other investments since they’re not happening anyway. Thus a policy of capital destruction to spur economic activity, like breaking windows or using regulatory fiat to mothball functional equipment, may never make more sense than during a liquidity trap. But that doesn’t mean it makes sense even then.

The late political scientist Samuel Huntington marveled at its place in our national life: We pledge allegiance to it. The national anthem celebrates it. An incredibly elaborate code stipulates how it’s displayed, handled and maintained. It even has its own holiday.

“Since the Civil War,” Huntington wrote, “Americans have been a flag-oriented people. The Stars and Stripes has the status of a religious icon and is a more central symbol of national identity for Americans than their flags are for peoples of other nations.”

The NFL players who kneel during the national anthem — a phenomenon that increased exponentially after President Trump colorfully demanded they stand — are disrespecting the most potent and enduring national symbol of the most patriotic nation on Earth.

Not only are they wrong to do so, they aren’t delivering the devastating rebuke to Trump they may imagine.

The power of national — or imperial — symbols isn’t new. The Romans couldn’t abide the collective disgrace of losing their standards to the enemy in battle, and would undertake decades-long campaigns to win them back.

The American flag is layered with history and meaning. As Tim Marshall recounts in his book, “A Flag Worth Dying For,” its roots probably reach back prior to the country’s independence. It may owe its red and white stripes to the flag of the Sons of Liberty, the revolutionary agitators who carried out the Boston Tea Party.

The “rebellious stripes” of that flag, lacking a field of stars, don’t look like much. In 1777, the Continental Congress added the stars.

The flag took time to catch on. The Civil War, which tested the integrity of the flag, represented a watershed. It came to be known as Old Glory at this time, courtesy of a cussed merchant seaman named William Driver, who demonstrated a characteristic American attitude to the Stars and Stripes.

Driver had retired to Nashville, Tenn., with his flag still in his possession. When local Confederates demanded he hand it over, he replied that they were welcome to take it — over his dead body. Secreted in a bed quilt, the flag was eventually handed over to Union forces, and the legend of Old Glory spread.

After the war, Union veterans advocated for the display of the flag and for its veneration. The National Flag Conference of 1923 — yes, there was a national flag conference — set out the code subsequently adopted by Congress.

Per the code, “the flag represents a living country and is

Nick Parr has resigned after just two years as chief executive of Dundee Rep, which boasts the country’s only full-time company of actors.

He has left with immediate effect less than two months after the Rep’s new artistic director, Andrew Panton, took charge of his first show. He has quit his role, which also saw him in charge of Scottish Dance Theatre, weeks before Dundee bids to become 2023 European Capital of Culture.

Earlier this year Mr Parr had hailed the financial performance of Dundee Rep and Scottish Dance Theatre, including rises in turnover and operating profit, and a 17 per cent boost at the box office.

However Kirsty Gunn’s opinion column in The Scotsman last Monday told how the company had been left “devastated and depressed” by cuts in its production department. She raised concerns of a growing culture “replacing creativity with bureaucracy, artists and intellectuals with managers”.

Mr Parr arrived at the Rep, which dates back to 1939, in September 2015 after previously working as commercial director at a trust running the Festival Theatre and King’s Theatre in Edinburgh.

It was the first time Dundee Rep had decided to split the post of chief executive and artistic director. However, the then holder of the latter post, Jemima Levick, announced her departure to another theatre company, Stellar Quines, less than six months later.

Mr Panton, who was allowed to combine his Dundee Rep role with an existing job as artistic director of musical theatre at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow, has been appointed interim joint chief excutive of the theatre, along with SDT’s artistic director, Fleur Darkin.

An official statement said: “Nick Parr has left his role as chief executive of Dundee Rep and Scottish Dance Theatre Ltd to pursue other opportunities. Andrew Panton and Fleur Darkin have been appointed interim joint chief executives.”

Ed Troughton, chair of the board, said: “We would like to thank Nick for his hard work and we wish him all the best. Andrew and Fleur will work with a strong and experienced senior management team to lead the organisation, and will report directly to the board.

“The other trustees and I are currently reviewing the structure and governance of the organisation to ensure we are in the strongest possible position for the future.”

Previews have shown the game to sometimes display a choppy frame-rate, and include long loading times. When I played the game back in September at EGX, both were noticeable (you can see footage of me playing the preview build below).

Last night, in a reddit AMA, Rime developer Tequila Works spoke about the technical challenges it faced when bringing the game to Switch - and the compromises it decided to make.

"Rime runs at 30fps in 720p throughout most of the game while docked," Tequila Works wrote. "This is a considerable improvement from where the game was at earlier this year when we announced the first delay.

"With Rime being very open in many locations, it's incredibly difficult to get these level segments small enough to not cause a hiccup in performance. We were faced with the choice of adding loading screens throughout the stages, rebuilding the game completely to be more closed in (undermining the product vision in the process), or living with these small hiccups to preserve what the game was intended to be. We chose the latter.

"When looking at the handheld mode, we had to make a choice between lowering the resolution, removing/replacing major parts of the level geometry, or having a bigger hit in performance. We decided to go for the former, because it allows us to maintain the integrity of the gameplay experience. All the important details are still very visible, and we've had no issues playing the game in handheld mode ourselves."

Tequila Works concluded by noting Rime did have similar issues on other platforms, albeit less pronounced.

But the fact Rime runs worst on Switch is particularly frustrating as a copy of Rime on Switch costs more than other platforms. On Amazon UK right now, a PS4 or Xbox One physical copy costs £25. On Switch, a physical copy from Amazon UK costs £32.

It's less than the expected cost of the game - which was initially set as £39.99 back in March, before the Switch port was delayed.

For digital copies, the prices are closer. On the Microsoft Store a digital download costs £23.99, while on both the PlayStation Store and Nintendo Switch eShop, it costs £29.99.

Are you picking up Rime for Switch? Is the added portability of the game worth a lower performance? Let us know.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Thousands of Catalans have rallied in Barcelona, Spain, demanding the right to hold a referendum on independence.

Participants, waving Catalan flags and wearing the flag's red and yellow colours, stood in a V-shape formation, indicating their desire for a vote.

Protesters were energised by Scotland's forthcoming independence referendum - and many also waved the Scottish flag.

The regional government has called a referendum for 9 November. The Spanish government says the vote is illegal.

"We want to decide our future. We don't understand why that is constantly denied," Victor Panyella, a professor taking part in the rally, told Reuters.

Ana Melendez, another participant, told the BBC she was "jealous" of Scotland, which has a referendum on independence from the rest of the United Kingdom on 18 September.

Catalonia is one of Spain's richest and most highly industrialised regions, and also one of the most independent-minded.

Until recently, few Catalans had wanted full independence, but Spain's painful economic crisis has seen a surge in support for separation.

The national government is opposed to any move towards independence. According to the Spanish constitution, the central government's blessing is required to make a referendum legal.

On Catalonia's national day, or La Diada, as it's called here, a huge crowd formed the thin red and yellow stripes of the Catalan flag, creating a giant 'V' for vote.

Look closer and you could see an endless number of pro-independence Catalan flags, which have a blue triangle and a silver star.

There were also a handful of Scottish flags fluttering in the wind.

Each year, the atmosphere at the La Diada celebrations is electric and it's easy to imagine the event being infectious for some.

The Catalan national anthem rings out, as do the deafening chants of "independence". People's dogs wear flags and people's faces are painted, party-style, in the Catalan colours.

The true numbers present in Barcelona today will be disputed, but a large chunk of the Catalan population turned out.

However another large number did not. The opinion polls are complex depending on the question, but if it's a simple "

I am a feminist. All this means is that I am extremely hairy and hate all men, both as individuals and collectively, with no exceptions. Nope. Not even Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen/Paul Hollywood/Ronnie Corbett/Trevor McDonald/David Attenborough or John Nettles circa Bergerac are good enough for me.

I even hate Ban Ki-moon. It’s one thing to try to eradicate female genital mutilation and forced marriage, but Mrs Ban Ki-moon told me she can’t remember the last time her husband put the Hoover round. Or sprayed his own soiled pants with pre-wash Vanish. Feminism begins at home, Mr Ban, not at the UN. Huh! Ban Ki-hypocrite, more like.

Feminists don’t like humour, except slapstick. Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, Laurel and Hardy and Bottom are all very popular at feminist comedy nights. Anything that involves men being physically harmed always goes down very well with feminists. They also enjoy watching Tom and Jerry, Road Runner cartoons and war documentaries.

Feminists never have sex and hate men opening doors for them, even into other dimensions.

Christmas is banned in the “feminist community”, along with birthdays, wallpaper, nuance, giving people the benefit of the doubt and all music. Feminists only ever listen to one song, on a loop: kd lang’s Constant Craving.

All feminists are lesbians. There is not a single heterosexual woman in the world who believes that women should have equal rights. Not one. If a feminist says she is heterosexual or bisexual or asexual, she is lying. They are all lesbians.

Feminism is the sole cause of the recession, global warming, terrorism, pandemics, cancelled flights, volcanos, delayed trains and overly pedantic health and safety regulations.

<|begin_of_text|>The Peace Tower (in French: Tour de la Paix), also known as the Tower of Victory and Peace (in French: tour de Victoire et de Paix),[1] is a focal bell and clock tower sitting on the central axis of the Centre Block of the Canadian parliament buildings in Ottawa, Ontario. The present incarnation replaced the 55-metre (180 ft) Victoria Tower after the latter burned down in 1916, along with most of the Centre Block; only the Library of Parliament survived. It serves as a Canadian icon[2] and had been featured prominently on the Canadian twenty-dollar bill directly adjacent the queen's visage, until the change to polymer.

Characteristics [ edit ]

Designed by Jean Omer Marchand and John A. Pearson, the tower is a campanile whose height reaches 92.2 m (302 ft 6 in),[3] over which are arranged a multitude of stone carvings, including approximately 370 gargoyles, grotesques, and friezes, keeping with the Victorian High Gothic style of the rest of the parliamentary complex. The walls are of Nepean sandstone and the roof is of reinforced concrete covered with copper.[4]

One of four grotesques at the corners of the Peace Tower

At its base is a porte-cochere within four equilateral pointed arches, the north of which frames the main entrance of the Centre Block, and the jambs of the south adorned by the supporters of the Royal Arms of Canada. Near the apex, just below the steeply pitched roof, are the tower's 4.8 m (16 ft) diameter clock faces,[4] one on each of the four facades. The mechanical workings of the timepiece were manufactured by the Verdin Company and are set by the National Research Council Time Signal. One level below, running around the circumference of the tower's shaft, is an observation deck.[3] This was the highest accessible space in Ottawa until the early 1970s; the Peace Tower dominated the Ottawa skyline, as a strict 45.7 m (150 ft) height limit was placed on other buildings. That limit, however, was later rescinded, leading the Peace Tower to lose its distinction as the city's tallest structure. Cantilevered out at each of the four corners of the tower, at the level of the observation platform, are four 2.5 m (8 ft 4 in) long, 75 cm (2 ft 6 in)

And in his defense, there's certainly no shortage of turkeys to go around, which can't be said about a handful of countries around the globe with national animals that are decidedly less common — some even extinct. Other countries proudly boast emblematic critters that are straight-out bizarre, and, in some cases, mythical.

From the dodo to the Komodo dragon to folkloric winged horses, we've assembled a motley menagerie of unusual and/or threatened national animals to consider.

1. Unicorn (Scotland)

Despite its mythical and occasionally sparkly depiction, the unicorn represents purity, strength and independence. (Photo: godam07/Shutterstock)

It's a creature that's majestic, mythical and possesses the singing voice of Mia Farrow. It appears (chained) on the Royal Coat of Arms and is a symbol of purity, strength and independence. It's also often covered in glitter and found in close proximity to magical rainbows. How could anyone take issue with the national animal of Scotland being a unicorn?

Shocking but true, a small but vocal group of Scots want to do away the unicorn, the heraldic symbol of Scotland that's also served as the country's national animal since the late 1300s. And what do these campaigners suggest take the unicorn’s place? They're pushing for another elusive beast to be named as Scotland's national animal, this one they believe to be real (at least for tourism purposes): the Loch Ness Monster. Their argument for the unicorn to be replaced by a lake-dwelling cryptid that's most likely a very large catfish? "How many people visit Scotland to look for unicorns? Exactly."

2. Dodo (Mauritius)

When you're a small island nation in the Indian Ocean and your most famous endemic bird is also the poster-animal for extinction, of course that bird would be your national animal. And although the dodo went, well, the way of itself circa 1662, the curious-looking flightless bird remains both a symbol of Mauritian pride and a potent reminder of the plight of endangered species across the globe threatened by human activity.

Although the story of the dodo — a cautionary national animal if there ever was one — is tragic

A disgraced Niagara Regional Police officer has been fined $15,000 for his part in a scheme that involved smuggling copious quantities of cheese and chicken wings across across the border.

Casey Langelaan, 49, resigned from the police service last year after he was caught up in a large-scale smuggling operation that saw thousands of dollars worth of U.S. cheese and chicken wings smuggled into Canada and sold to Ontario restaurants.

"A man of otherwise good character has been embarrassed and shamed in his community," Judge David Harris said Friday after Langelaan pleaded guilty in a St. Catharines, Ont., courtroom to charges of evading compliance with the Canada Customs Act and possession of imported goods.

Court heard the investigation began in January 2012 and involved Niagara police, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the Canada Border Services Agency.

The investigation initially focused on the cross-border activities of another NRP officer, Const. Geoff Purdie, who is now serving time behind bars in an American jail for smuggling steroids into Canada.

When investigators questioned Purdie, he offered up Langelaan, a sergeant at the time and making well over $100,000 a year, as a fellow smuggler.

But instead of smuggling steroids, court heard, Langelaan’s preference was cheese and chicken wings.

No one was interested in the poultry, court heard, but Langelaan, a resident of Fort Erie, sold the cheese to restaurants in Aylmer and Dorchester, Ont., at a profit of more than $50,000.

Lawyer Paul O’Marra described his client as a "highly respected officer" whose reputation has taken a “major hit” because of the crimes.

O’Marra said Langelaan has also suffered a blow to his pocketbook.

Canada Borders Services Agency wants him to pay a penalty of $50,000, almost three times the amount of duties and taxes the former cop didn’t pay at the border. That matter is subject to civil litigation.

His taxes were also re-assessed.

Two other people were arrested as a result of the investigation that revealed more than $200,000 worth of cheese had been purchased in the U.S. and distributed in Canada. Const. Scott Herron and Bernie Pollino are scheduled to appear in court Dec. 12.

According to the CBSA, travellers can bring back, duty free, $20 or 20 kilograms in total (whichever limit is reached first) of dairy

<|begin_of_text|>Somerset Bridge is a small bridge located in the western parish of Sandys, in Bermuda, connecting Somerset Island with the mainland. The stone bridge is walled solid, save for a narrow arch near one of its banks that allows small boats to pass underneath. There is enough headroom for a motorboat to pass through comfortably but not a sailboat. To allow a sailboat with a tall mast to squeeze through, a section of the motorway over the arch was replaced with wooden planks that could be raised creating a mini drawbridge. This section is just 32 inches wide, and is widely believed to be the smallest working drawbridge in the world.

Photo credit

The original bridge dates back to 1620, and although the bridge was largely rebuilt in the mid 20th century, much of the original stonework remains. The bridge was originally raised using a hand crank, but now consist of two cantilevered half-spans made of thick timber panels. The panels can be grabbed by the sides and lifted to create a narrow gap just wide enough for the mast of a sailboat to pass through. Judging by the size of the gap, I believe it takes a fair amount of skill to navigate the gap without mishap. Often a sailor has to be assisted in opening the drawbridge and making the passage safely, so it’s not uncommon to find sailboat captains calling upon pedestrians for help.

Although not quite an attraction, the bridge’s unique reputation has earned it a place on the reverse of Bermuda’s $20 bills issued in 2009.

MIAMI (CBSMiami) – Video of Justin Bieber captured shortly after his arrest on Miami Beach shows the pop star submitting to a sobriety test in which he appears to momentarily lose his balance while attempting to walk along a straight white line.

In the clip from the holding area of the Miami Beach Police Department, part of more than 9 hours of video released Wednesday, Bieber is walking heel to toe when he slightly stumbles as he turns. He starts the walk over again.

Bieber then removes several items of clothing for a pat down.

He’s eventually led to a holding cell where he waits for a couple hours before eventually being transported via van to jail.

The embattled entertainer can be seen doing push-ups and pacing in the small space while he waits.

The videos do not contain audio.

Attorneys for CBS4 and its news partner the Miami Herald, along with attorneys for media outlets including CNN and the Associated Press, went to court last week to argue that since the tapes have been turned over to the defense as part of the discovery process in the case; the videos are now public record, and open to being viewed in their entirety.

Tuesday, Bieber’s defense team said they did not object to prosecutors releasing most of the video footage with the exception of five video clips which may show the 19-year old pop star urinating into a cup for a drug test.

Web Extra: Surveillance Video Recorded In Miami Beach Police Department Following Justin Bieber’s Arrest

As for the five disputed video clips, Judge William Altfield will view them, and review more court filings, before announcing his decision on March 4th.

Police stopped Bieber and singer Khalil Amir Sharieff on January 23rd after what they said was an illegal street drag race involving exotic cars.

Breath tests showed that Bieber’s blood-alcohol content was below the.02 legal limit for underage drivers, but toxicology tests revealed the presence of the active ingredient in marijuana and the antidepressant Xanax.

Bieber has pleaded not guilty to driving under the influence, resisting arrest and invalid-license charges.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Organizers of the former Montreal Anarchist Bookfair are celebrating their new identity after they renamed themselves The Bourgeois Feminist Bookfair. “We realized that we’re not an anarchist collective after all,” says activist and bourgeois neo-liberal feminist Lucy Descharnes. “We don’t care about anarchism, we don’t care about the working class, and we don’t care about economic issues. Our main interest is in protecting the privileges of wealthy university graduates, so we decided to change the name of our organization to better reflect our actual values. We’re bourgeois, we're educated, we're affluent, and we're proud of it."Anarchists across Montreal say that they’re not surprised by the name change. “I can’t remember the last time the anarchist bookfair actually catered to genuine anarchists,” says working class activist Jesse Hogan. “It’s been a giant bourgeois shit show for the last decade. Last year took the cake, though, after they gave white and affluent academic feminists the power to ban men from attending the event. Seriously, if a wealthy educated feminist didn’t like you, you couldn’t attend. All she had to say was that you made her feel uncomfortable. The organizers justified their actions because they believe that working class men have more power and privilege than bourgeois feminists. I’m not comfortable with bourgeois feminists being anywhere near me, but the bookfair doesn’t care about creating a safe space for the working class. Safe spaces only exist to protect the bourgeoisie from the rabble."Lucy agrees. “At the end of the day, a wealthy white woman with a Ph.D from Concordia is far more oppressed than a working class man who was born into poverty,” says Lucy. “At the Bourgeois Feminist Bookfair, we believe in intersectional feminism, which is the religious conviction that oppressions intersect in a way that minimizes and erases class privilege. For example, if you’re a poor homeless man, your penis gives you way more privilege than Martha Stewart or Michelle Obama. A homeless man’s male privilege intersects with his poverty, erasing it’s very existence from the face of the earth. Bourgeois feminists recognize that class is irrelevant — it’s the least important factor in oppression. We also believe in the one drop rule: if you have a single drop of non-economic privilege, that privilege erases the economic factors in your life. You’re white? Your class doesn’t matter. You're a man? Your class doesn’t matter. You’re straight?

<|begin_of_text|>NASA’s next major space observatory is meant to tackle some of the biggest questions in astronomy when it launches in 2025—including what exoplanets look like and how dark energy is driving the Universe’s expansion. But the project’s cost is rising quickly, and NASA managers are struggling to keep its budget in check.

The Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) has grown in scope and complexity since it was proposed nearly a decade ago, and its price has swollen from US$1.6 billion in 2010 to the current estimate of $3.2 billion ($2.4 billion in 2010 dollars). That has raised concern at NASA, which in April commissioned a review by independent aero-space experts. Their report is due in the next few months.

Above all, the agency wants to keep WFIRST from following the path of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), a successor to the Hubble telescope that is scheduled to launch in 2018. That project’s cost spiralled from $1 billion in the early 2000s to $8.8 billion—and nearly exhausted NASA’s astrophysics budget.

The WFIRST review is meant to stave off that kind of meltdown. “This is a good time to take a look at the scale and scope of the mission,” says Jon Morse, a former head of NASA’s astrophysics division who is now chief executive of the BoldlyGo Institute, a non-profit space-exploration organization in New York City. “Nobody wants this thing to double in cost.”

Bonus features

WFIRST was the top-ranked big space mission in the 2010 decadal survey in astronomy and astrophysics, a list created by researchers to prioritize projects for the next ten years. Then the National Reconnaissance Office gave NASA a 2.4-metre mirror—replacing WFIRST’s planned 1.5-metre mirror—and the space agency started dreaming big. The larger mirror allowed NASA to add a corona-graph, an instrument that studies exoplanets by blocking light from the stars they orbit.

And NASA made other design changes to go along with the big mirror. It also began to consider adding a ‘starshade’, a free-floating umbrella-like spacecraft that would fly alongside WFIRST and block enough light for the telescope to spy Earth-sized planets.

WFIRST’s heart is a gigantic camera with 18 detectors, each capable of capturing a 16-mega-pixel shot—giving it a field of view 200 times Hubble

Hard drive storage continues to increase at a steady rate, but just how long can we keep squeezing more data on to those platters? TDK has managed to ensure that the density keeps rising for a few more generations with its HAMR head innovation, but that may have already been rendered redundant through another discovery by a Dr Joel Yang at the Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE).

Existing hard drives max out at 3TB at the moment. TDK’s HAMR promises to take that to 6TB, but Dr Yang has found a way to increase the data density of a drive to 3.3 Terabit/inch2, effectively meaning 18TB hard drives are possible.

What may surprise you is the key to this massive increase in data storage density. Dr Yang used table salt, or more specifically, sodium chloride.

Data stored on a hard drive is done so using nanoscopic magnetic grains. Typically, several of these grains (a cluster), each measuring around 7nm, are used to store one bit of information. Therefore, if you can pack them more densely together, you get more storage in the same space.

By adding sodium chloride to the mix, it has been possible to get a single 10nm grain storing one bit. Replacing several 7nm grains with one 10nm saves a lot of space and therefore ups the storage density considerably.

The good news is the use of sodium chloride can be added to existing lithography processes, suggesting it won’t take too long to get this up and running for commercial drives. So far a 1.9 Terabit/inch2 storage solution has been shown to work, but that will increase to 3.3 Terabit/inch2, and then further research and development is aiming to achieve 10 Terabit/inch2 in the future.

For us as consumers, it means the hard drive still has quite a few years of storage bumps still to come, and a greater challenge for SSDs trying to catch up with the amount of storage on offer. This also bodes well for data centers who need to cater for a never-ending storage need as more cloud services go online.

He praised the extraordinary alliance and deep friendship between Canada and the United States.

"We see ourselves in each other and our lives are richer for it," Obama said.

"The enduring partnership between Canada and the United States is as strong as it has ever been and we are more closely aligned than ever before."

The American president reserved heartfelt mention for Trudeau, who he said has brought "new energy and hope" to the cross-border relationship.

"My time in office may be nearing an end, but I know that Canada and the world will benefit from your leadership in the years to come."

But he also included pointed comments on a perennial sore spot, one that has taken fresh urgency in the face of a resurgent Russia and rising Islamic extremism.

"As your NATO ally and your friend, let me say, we'll be more secure when every NATO member, including Canada, contributes its full share to our common security," Obama said to sustained applause from both Liberals and Conservative MPs and senators, who returned from summer break for the historic event.

"Because the Canadian Armed Forces are really good. And if I can borrow a phrase, the world needs more Canada. NATO needs more Canada. We need you."

Washington has been ratcheting up the pressure on Ottawa to spend more for two years, ever since Russia annexed Crimea and set off a shadow war in eastern Ukraine.

At the moment, Canada spends just under $20 billion on defence — or 1 per cent of its gross domestic product, which is half the NATO standard.

The Trudeau government has also waffled on a call by NATO to contribute to a high-mobility brigade destined for eastern Europe as a deterrence measure.

Although the federal government has privately expressed interest, it has yet to formally declare this publicly.

Obama's remarks will put more pressure on the Liberal government for a public pronouncement.

His appearance on the floor of the House of Commons, alongside Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau,was greeted with a thunderous ovation.

Outside of Smash, I am an active member of the wider fighting game community. At both local tournaments and large scale events, I have seen people play with everything from a PS1 gamepad with a converter to a pizza box with 20+ buttons on it without any issues. Controller configurations that prove to be problematic from a logistical or competitive point of view are banned when they prove to be problematic at an event (most wireless controllers, turbo buttons, and certain buggy platform converters). If a community so similar to our own in terms of logistics can run well with very lax controller rules, what is different about Smash that changes the logistics enough to warrant banning the controllers? Click to expand...

The main difference between Melee and other FGs, as I'm sure you know, is the use of analog controls. Replacing left, right, up, and down with digital buttons is not a huge change for the average FG. For Melee, being able to hit precise angles is obviously a very powerful technique. Whether it's for perfect up-B angles, airdodges, wavedashes/wavelands, or DI, hitting specific angles is a skill that has been an inherent part of the game since its inception. If you have a controller that can do all of this for free, you're removing skill from the game and creating an unearned skill gap between the players who use a custom controller vs. the standard. Hax himself has admitted that his perfect wavedash angles were obnoxiously good, so he has attempted to mitigate this advantage by preventing perfect angles on the B0XX. There are plenty of other issues, such as multiple SDI inputs. Due to the nature of a button vs. a stick, you can easily double/triple tap fightstick buttons to get multiple SDIs. I'm not very experienced on a fightstick, but it still only took me a few minutes of testing to get 3 inputs in a 5 frame window. This kind of capability would result in people triple SDIing shines, and would greatly ruin the integrity of the game.All of these advantages that make custom controllers able to perform things that are normally difficult or impossible would have to be limited before these controllers could be allowed. That means TOs have to decide how good

Cliff Burton, who was one of the founding members of Metallica, played bass guitar on the metal band’s first three albums until he was killed in a tour bus accident in 1986.

The royalties from these albums have been going to Cliff’s 92-year-old father Ray—and the senior has only now revealed what he’s been spending that money on.

CHECK OUT: Metallica Replaces Stolen Equipment of Tribute Band

Ray has been donating all of the Metallica royalties towards musical scholarships for Castro Valley High School students in the San Francisco Bay area of California.

The school has sentimental value to Ray since it was the school which Cliff attended when he was younger.

“The kids who won it, they invariably write and thank me,” Ray told the Alphabettica podcast host last month. “And I think Cliff probably would have done that with his money, because he was not against education by any means. He liked it very much.”

Yesterday the Herald revealed there are now 10 $100 notes in circulation for each Australian, far more than the more commonly seen $20 notes.

One popular explanation is that they are used for illegal transactions as part of the cash economy, something the former Reserve official, Peter Mair, rejects as a "furphy".

In a letter to the Reserve Bank governor, Glenn Stevens, dated July 4, Mr Mair laid the blame squarely on elderly people wanting to get the pension and hiding their income in cash to ensure they

You may recall not long ago Trump reversed Obama’s decision which forced states to allow trannies into certain bathrooms. Our current President didn’t outlaw those transgender bathroom privileges, but simply restored the states’ power to discern for themselves. Therein lies the outrage.

Apple and other companies have decided to take a stand… By getting involved in a lawsuit filed by a trans student suing his school for boys’ bathroom privileges.

Something to note here? People were uncomfortable sharing the restroom with Gavin Grimm, the girl-boy, so the school provided a unisex restroom to him in an attempt to make everyone happy. The boys wouldn’t have to bare themselves before a lady-man, and the trans student wouldn’t have to share a restroom with girls. But it wasn’t enough for the amorphous slug. Of course.

Now he’s demanding access to the boys’ rooms via lawsuit. Entitled little toad. This is the case that Apple and friends are jumping in to support…

A number of leading tech firms plan to file a brief in favor of transgender rights in a case due to be heard next month in the Supreme Court. Apple has been among those leading the charge on the effort, along with… Affirm, Box, Ebay, GitHub, IBM, Microsoft, PayPal, Salesforce, Slack, Tumblr, Yelp. Apple has already spoken out on the Trump Administration’s move to pull back on Obama-era guidance that interpreted existing law to require schools to let students use the restroom that matches their gender identity. The Supreme Court case, involving Virginia high school student Gavin Grimm, asks the court to weigh in on the same question.

These companies really, really care about rights. Just not the rights of the states. Or those who want to potty in peace. It seems as though Apple misses not a single opportunity to get hyper-political (see Apple Goes Full PC, Replaces ‘Offensive’ Gun Emoji With Squirt Gun… and Far-Left Apple CEO to Wage War on Fake News. Misses HUGE Irony…). We’re finding that tech companies are becoming more and more politically involved. Why stick with creating better tech products when you can wade into potty politics? Maybe there’s an app for that.

<|begin_of_text|>(a) The general principles and factors that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considered in arriving at the reference amounts customarily consumed per eating occasion (reference amounts) which are set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, are that: (1) FDA calculated the reference amounts for persons 4 years of age or older to reflect the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by persons in this population group. These reference amounts are based on data set forth in appropriate national food consumption surveys. (2) FDA calculated the reference amounts for an infant or child under 4 years of age to reflect the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by infants up to 12 months of age or by children 1 through 3 years of age, respectively. These reference amounts are based on data set forth in appropriate national food consumption surveys. Such reference amounts are to be used only when the food is specially formulated or processed for use by an infant or by a child under 4 years of age. (3) An appropriate national food consumption survey includes a large sample size representative of the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the relevant population group and must be based on consumption data under actual conditions of use. (4) To determine the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion, FDA considered the mean, median, and mode of the consumed amount per eating occasion. (5) When survey data were insufficient, FDA took various other sources of information on serving sizes of food into consideration. These other sources of information included: (i) Serving sizes used in dietary guidance recommendations or recommended by other authoritative systems or organizations; (ii) Serving sizes recommended in comments; (iii) Serving sizes used by manufacturers and grocers; and (iv) Serving sizes used by other countries. (6) Because they reflect the amount customarily consumed, the reference amount and, in turn, the serving size declared on the product label are based on only the edible portion of food, and not bone, seed, shell, or other inedible components. (7) The reference amount is based on the major intended use of the food (e.g., milk as a beverage and not as an addition to cereal). (8) The reference amounts for products that are consumed as an ingredient of other foods, but that may also be consumed in the form in which they are purchased (e.g., butter), are based on use in the form purchased.

<|begin_of_text|>Team Android at Basecamp recently passed a fairly big milestone — over 25% of the Basecamp 3 Android app code base now runs on Kotlin! 🎉

We’ve found that Kotlin not only makes our code much better, but massively increases programmer happiness. All of this ensures we’re making the best app we can for the tens of thousands of Android users we support.

Given our new experiences with the language, I thought it’d be worth sharing some specifics that make the language so wonderful to work with.

Unlike most articles that introduce you to a language, I’m going to avoid using too much programming lingo. Instead, I’ll try using plain English in the hopes that it’s more accessible to beginners. 🤗

Some notes about the code examples:

I am by no stretch an expert in Kotlin. Read, consider, and discuss!

They look better on a desktop browser. You can get by on the mobile app in landscape mode, but I’d recommend breaking out your laptop to read them.

You can get by on the mobile app in landscape mode, but I’d recommend breaking out your laptop to read them. They’re brief and simple on purpose. Long-winded examples tend to cause confusion. Take these simple examples and extrapolate them into your own potential uses, and you’ll see a lot more power.

Let’s get started with seven of my current favorites!

1. Replacing simple if/else if/else blocks with when

One of my absolute favorites.

// Java

if (firstName.equals("Dan")) {

person.setTeam(programmers);

} else if (lastName.equals("Dihiansan")) {

person.setTeam(designers);

} else {

person.setTeam(others);

}

// Kotlin

when {

firstName == "Dan" -> person.team = programmers

lastName == "Dihiansan" -> person.team = designers

else -> person.team = others

}

when blocks are effectively the same as a simple if block, but look how much more readable that is!

There’s a similar convention when only one argument is being checked. Typically this would be a long, ugly switch/case statement in Java.

// Java

switch (firstName) {

case "Dan": person.setTeam(programmers)

break;

case "Jay": person.setTeam(programmers)

break;

case "Jamie": person.setTeam(designers)

break;

default:

person.setTeam(others)

}

// Kotlin

when (firstName) {

"Dan", "Jay" -> person.team = programmers

The assaults keep coming like the Terminator, don't they? This one is bipartisan, too. Comes to you from Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI) and Rep. C.A. �Dutch� Ruppersberger (D-MD). Strongly recommend reading the entire article.

Watch out, Washington: CISPA replaces SOPA as Internet�s Enemy No. 1

By Andrew Couts

Digital Trends

....Unveiled to the House by Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI) and Rep. C.A. �Dutch� Ruppersberger (D-MD) late last year, CISPA is described as a �cybersecurity� bill. It proposes to amend the National Security Act of 1947 to allow for greater sharing of �cyber threat intelligence� between the U.S. government and the private sector, or between private companies. The bill defines �cyber threat intelligence� as any information pertaining to vulnerabilities of, or threats to, networks or systems owned and operated by the U.S. government, or U.S. companies; or efforts to �degrade, disrupt, or destroy� such systems or networks; or the theft or �misappropriation� of any private or government information, including intellectual property.

....

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) adds that CISPA�s definition of �cybersecurity� is so broad that �it leaves the door open to censor any speech that a company believes would �degrade the network.�� Moreover, the inclusion of �intellectual property� means that companies and the government would have �new powers to monitor and censor communications for copyright infringement.�

Furthermore, critics warn that CISPA gives private companies the ability to collect and share information about their customers or users with immunity � meaning we cannot sue them for doing so, and they cannot be charged with any crimes. According to the EFF, CISPA �effectively creates a �cybersecurity� exemption to all existing laws.�

�There are almost no restrictions on what can be collected and how it can be used, provided a company can claim it was motivated by �cybersecurity purposes,�� the EFF continues. �That means a company like Google, Facebook, Twitter, or AT&T could intercept your emails and text

The cover photo of the calendar and diary shows Modi weaving khadi on a large ‘charkha’, in the same classic pose as Gandhiji. In response, the employees of KVIC at its Vile Parle headquarters plan to stage “a silent, soul-cleansing” protest wearing black bands on their mouths, during lunch hour on Thursday.

Political leaders took a jibe at the Prime Minister for replacing the iconic image of Gandhi, including Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and former AAP member Yogendra Yadav, tweeting about it.

“Becoming Gandhi requires years of austerities. One cannot become Gandhi by acting to spin the Charkha, this would only ridicule them,” Kejriwal said in a tweet.

Gandhiji would've welcomed it, also opposed his photo on notes.

We should welcome it too. Less hypocrisy.https://t.co/q1fVI2RYmA — Yogendra Yadav (@_YogendraYadav) January 12, 2017

Rahul too called Modi’s move “the mangalyaan effect”, referring to India’s Mars Orbiter Mission.

While Gandhi’s historic picture weaving khadi on a simple charkha, wearing his trademark loin cloth, is legendary and imprinted in the minds of the masses since generations, Modi comes across in his signature attire of kurta-pyjama-waistcoat, weaving khadi on a slightly modern charkha.

KVIC chairman Vinai Kumar Saxena said this was “not unusual” and there have been deviations in the past.

“The entire khadi industry (udyog) is based on Gandhiji’s philosophy, ideas and ideals, he is the soul of KVIC, so there is no question of ignoring him,” Saxena told IANS.

Leader Jeremy Corbyn immediately responded warmly to the announcement

“This vote is a victory for democracy and for the people of this country,” he said.

“And rest assured we will use it to continue our long-standing policy of doing f**k all about Brexit.”

Labour have been committed to doing f**k all about Britain leaving the EU since the referendum was announced by David Cameron, whoever he is, some eighteen months ago.

Immediately after the referendum announcement, Jeremy Corbyn swung into action by doing f**k all.

When campaigning started in earnest Labour remained constant in doing f**k all.

Not wishing to let the momentum drop, at the height of the campaign Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell did f**k all.

Finally, when the referendum result was announced, Jeremy Corbyn did his best to rally shellshocked remainers by doing f**k all.

Every day since, Labour has remained proudly committed to doing f**k all about Brexit and, with this new announcement, look set to continue doing f**k all until the country is completely isolated and vilified, and is ultimately reduced to being little more than a nice place for Donald Trump to park his helicopter.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Taiwan bans GMOs from school menus

Entire world revolting against U.S. agricultural imperialism and fascist, corporate-dictated government policy

(NaturalNews) Even as the fascist, corrupt U.S. government and its regulators (FDA and USDA) actively conspire with the biotech industry to poison Americans with genetically modified foods, Taiwan has already passed and implemented a nationwide law to protect its citizens from GMOs.Nearly a full year ago, Taiwan passedthat achieve remarkable food safety milestones the U.S. government refuses to implement, placing Taiwan far ahead of the United States on food safety. These milestones include:1) Requiring the mandatory labeling of GMOs on all food products that contain 3 percent or more GMOs. Foods that use no GMOs may be labeled "non-GMO"... and many already are, causing their sales to skyrocket across Taiwan. Just last year, imports of non-GMO soybeans to Taiwan grew nearly 300% to 58,000 tons.2) Limiting the use of food additives to just 799 compounds approved by the Taiwan FDA. The FDA of the United States, by comparison, allows tens of thousands of chemicals to be used as additives, even when they are well known to cause cancer.3) All GMO ingredients are required to be registered with the Taiwan government, and food manufacturers that use GMOs are required to establish an origins tracking system to identify where those GMOs originated.4) All the soy milk, tofu, miso and other soy-derived products sold everywhere across the country -- including at cafes and street food vendors -- must be clearly labeled as GMOs if they use genetically modified soy.5) Food products made using genetically modified soy as a processing agent or blended ingredient must also label their final food products as GMO, even if the soybean oil is not, itself, the final product.6) Fines for violating these food safety provisions have been set at NT$50 million.This shows yet again just how far behind the United States is on food safety compared to the rest of the world. Instead of promoting actual food safety, the FDA gives a free pass to GMOs, heavy metals, artificial additives and other toxic chemicals, focusing almost exclusively on bacteriological contamination issues such as e.coli and salmonella.That's why the USA lags far behind the rest of the world on the banning of artificial additives and preservative chemicals, most of which have already been banned across the EU.

Two U.S. astronauts, including the oldest woman ever to participate in an Extravehicular Activity (EVA), triumphantly concluded a six-hour and 32-minute spacewalk outside the International Space Station (ISS) earlier today. Expedition 50 Commander Shane Kimbrough and Flight Engineer Peggy Whitson breezed through the task of installing three new adapter plates and hooked up electrical connectors for a trio of new lithium-ion (Li-Ion) batteries on the starboard-side S-4 segment of the station’s Integrated Truss Structure (ITS). Their work heralds the start of a two-year campaign of EVAs and robotics, which will see 48 aging nickel-hydrogen batteries on the port and starboard trusses replaced with 24 smaller, but higher-performing, lithium-ion ones. Working around an hour ahead of the timeline, Kimbrough and Whitson were also able to complete several “get-ahead” tasks, including a photographic survey of the station’s Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-2).

Today’s spacewalk was designated “U.S. EVA-38” and represented the 38th spacewalk to be conducted out of the Quest airlock, with astronauts clad in U.S.-built Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMUs) and conducted in the absence of the space shuttle. Since U.S. EVA-1, way back in February 2002, these excursions have outfitted new hardware, removed and replaced faulty equipment, reconfigured coolant loops, tackled ammonia leaks, and laid cables in readiness for Commercial Crew operations and the arrival or relocation of pressurized modules. Last summer, Expedition 48 spacewalkers Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins performed EVAs 36 and 37 to install an International Docking Adapter (IDA-2) onto the Harmony node and retract the Trailing Thermal Control Radiator (TTCR) on the station’s port-side P-6 truss.

These U.S. Orbital Segment (USOS)-based EVAs have been performed not only by NASA astronauts, but have also involved German, Russian, Japanese, Italian, and British nationals. They have seen a number of records secured, including Sunita Williams becoming the most experienced female spacewalker and holder of the greatest number of EVAs—seven—ever conducted by a woman. Yet during today’s EVA-38, one of Williams’ achievements was

The study, conducted by scientists at The National Weight Control Registry, determined conclusively that shedding excess weight has never occurred, changing your appearance is impossible, and that it actually feels “pretty nice” to just give up and realize that you’re powerless to alter your body mass index in any way, shape, or form.

“Our findings indicate that if you’re trying to lose weight, you will fail—and that’s because you can’t, no one has, and you need to stop trying because it will never happen,” said Dr. Rena Wing, lead author of the report. “You could work out every day and eat nothing, and you still wouldn’t lose an ounce. And the sooner you throw up your hands and make peace with that fact, the better off you’ll be.”

“Our data demonstrates that you’re doomed to look the way you look,” Wing added. “You are stuck in your body and it’s never going to look any better than it does right now. In fact, it will only get worse.”

According to the study, running on a treadmill every morning at 6 a.m. will not help anyone lose weight, and neither will cutting carbohydrates from one’s diet, eating smaller portions throughout the day, doing yoga, or hiring a personal trainer. In addition, the study went on to state that everyone who tried the previous methods have only ended up feeling disappointed and in some cases heartbroken, especially after individuals step onto a scale and realize that, after two weeks of healthy eating and nonstop exercise, they’ve actually gained two or more pounds.

The report added that skinny people stay skinny, overweight people remain overweight, that’s how it has always been, that’s how it will always be, and every study, book, or news article you’ve ever read that has told you otherwise has been totally and completely wrong.

“Going to the gym is a waste of time if you are doing it to lose weight,” said University of California physiologist Dr. Andrew Novak, adding that time working out would be better spent reading, spending time with your family, sleeping, watching television, or eating. “Now, if you are exercising to prevent heart disease or cancer, well, new evidence has come to light that

The basic tenets of economics tell us that supply, demand, and price as all intertwined, especially in free markets. While the silver market may be not as free as we would like, compared to most, it is relatively free, and it should be very much subject to basic economic laws.

Last week, I called a number of silver buyers, sellers and coin shops to get an idea of how the market was responding to the massive run up in silver prices. Needless to say, the results weren't exactly as I had expected. I thought that during the run up, shops would report that some of their regular investors had been taking profits. This wasn't the case.

The Survey

In what cannot at all be seen as an entirely representative sample, a total of 15 coin shops were phoned and surveyed about their total sales. All but three had seen an increase in sales of junk jewelry metals, as people were cashing out for a variety of reasons, most of which are probably preparing for the holidays. One said he had seen a decrease in junk sales, but admitted he had no hard numbers on which to base his claim.

The remaining two declined to comment. One suggested that it was a theft risk to release such data. We'll mark that particular shop as busier than normal.

As for sales of silver, all of the shops who said they were purchasing more junk silver than normal noted that they had, in fact, sold more silver bullion, even as prices rose higher. A few, more than willing to divulge such information, even noted that the regulars were buying more weight, while one-time customers were coming in to raise cash.

Therefore, from our small study, it can be reasonably concluded that even as prices tear towards the upside, there is little interest among the current physical silver investing community to let go of their silver. Instead, as prices head higher, we, as the good little investors we are, continue to buy more, not less, of the beautiful metals.

The Irony of Investment Markets

This is perhaps the irony of the silver markets, or any non-replacement investment market for that matter. As the market heads higher, the supply is not increasing at the retail recycling level or at the production level. Silver miners are not wholly silver miners, and they have to find copper before they can find silver. Therefore, while miners would love to start working overtime to dig silver, supplies ready to be quickly unearthed have yet to be discovered.

Friday's epic USA versus Canada Winter Olympic hockey matchup highlighted another spat between the two countries involving pop star Justin Bieber.

A new electronic scoreboard in a Chicago suburb shows Chicago Blackhawks forward Patrick Kane -- who plays for the USA -- and Team Canada's Jonathan Toews in between a picture of Bieber. The caption says "Loser Keeps Biebs."

Bieber, who's Canadian, lives in Los Angeles, but after several high-profile incidents, many Americans have called for the singer to be deported.

Best of the Sochi Olympics: Day 13

Bieber is also infamous among Chicagoans for a controversy he ignited after the Hawks won the Stanley Cup championship last year.

While the singer was in the Blackhawks' locker room at the United Center taking pictures of the trophy, he was photographed standing on the Indian head logo, prompting a huge outcry of anger from fans of the team.

After Canada won the Olympic gold medal game in Sochi, 1-0, the company immediately followed up with a new billboard below.

LETTER TO THE PRIME MINISTER

9 April 2014

Dear Prime Minister,

It is with the thinnest possible veneer of synthesised guilt that I have been convinced to tender my resignation as a member of the cabinet.

I am very grateful to you for inexplicably having my back throughout this mess, but the present situation has become a distraction from the vital work this government is doing to distract the public from the ongoing abuse of government expenses.

I have been a member of the Conservative party for more than 30 years. I know that our party understands the importance of giving everyone the opportunity to succeed regardless of where they come from, so long as they come from my immediate family and prefer having a nicely decorated house to being able to sleep at night.

I am immensely proud of what my team have been able to achieve during my time in government: uniting our great arts and cultural institutions in unanimous agreement that I should resign; putting women front and centre of the continuing expenses scandal; putting in place the legislation to enable all couples to have the opportunity to marry regardless of their sexuality. I mean, there was that time I voted against a move to allow ministers to introduce regulations banning harassment on grounds of sexual orientation, but that was way before you made me look after gay people. Besides, accurate recollections have never exactly been my strong point, have they?

Did I mention that I went to a comprehensive? Because I totally did.

Implementing the recommendations made by Sir Brian Leveson on the future of media regulation wasn't the success I'd hoped it to be, either. I mean, seriously, what's the point of limiting the freedom of the press if I can't even bully editors into shutting up about my dodgy mortgage? Still, whatever. I get the message. I'll lie low for a bit.

I will continue to support you and the work of the government as you move forward. Ensuring the best future for people of Basingstoke who I'm directly related to has been my priority throughout the past nine years. Whether on the front or back benches, I will continue this work. But, who are we kidding, it'll probably be the front benches, right?

I did mention I went to a comprehensive, didn't I?

The only reason I became an MP was that I wanted to give something back. Sadly, there was some disagreement about the

Does the mayor agree on Police Chief Beck's "out of policy" decision not to punish eight officers in the Dorner manhunt? NBC4's Conan Nolan talks to the mayor about that and a multiple of other issues including raising the wage to $15 in this three-part interview. (Published Saturday, Feb. 8, 2014)

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti says he "expected something stronger" from his police chief in disciplining eight Los Angeles police officers in the shooting of two women a year ago in Torrance.

While the shooting was determined to be in "violation of policy," Police Chief Charlie Beck has indicated the officers will be returning to street patrols and will be subject to additional training.

On NBC4's "News Conference" program Sunday morning, Garcetti said he disagreed with the decision.

"I think I would have respectfully said it should have been something a little more harsh...we don't want to get rid of police officers who have a good career but we do need to make sure this isn't repeated again," Garcetti said.

The victims, a mother and her daughter, were shot while delivering newspapers in the early morning hours of February 7, 2013. Officers believed their target was former LAPD officer Christopher Dorner, who murdered three people during a four day crime spree in Southern California.

Despite the disagreement over disciplining the officers, Garcetti voiced support for Beck.

"My managers I trust and they are going to make different decisions at different points... he's been a super Chief," Garcetti said.

<|begin_of_text|>The combat code of the US Military is that we don’t abandon our dead or wounded on the battlefield. In US Air Force lingo, fighter pilots don’t run off and leave their wingmen. If one of our own is shot down, still alive and not yet in enemy captivity, we will either come to get him or die trying. Among America’s fighting forces, the calm, sure knowledge that such an irrevocable bond exists is priceless. Along with individual faith and personal grit, it is a sacred trust that has often sustained hope in the face of terribly long odds.

The disgraceful abandonment of our Ambassador and those brave ex-SEALs who fought to their deaths to save others in that compound is nothing short of dereliction-of-duty. Additionally, the patently absurd cover-up scenario that was fabricated in the aftermath was an outright lie in attempt to shield the President and the Secretary of State from responsibility.

It has been over eight months since the attack on our compound in Benghazi. The White House strategy, with the aid of a “lap dog press” has been to run out the clock before the truth is forthcoming. The recent testimonies of the three “whistle blowers” have reopened the subject and hopefully will lead to exposure and disgrace of those responsible for this embarrassing debacle.

It would appear that the most recent firewall which the Administration is counting on is the contention that there were simply no military assets that could be brought to bear in time to make a difference… mainly due to the unavailability of tanker support for fighter aircraft. This is simply BS, regardless how many supposed “experts” the Administration trot out to make such an assertion. The bottom line is that even if the closest asset capable of response was half-way around the world, you don’t just sit on your penguin *** and do nothing. The fact is that the closest asset was not half-way around the world, but as near as Aviano Air Base, Italy where two squadrons of F-16Cs are based.

Consider the following scenario (all times Benghazi local):

When Hicks in Tripoli receives a call at 9:40 PM from Ambassador Stevens informing him “Greg, we are under attack!” (his last words), he immediately notifies all agencies and prepares for the immediate initiation of an existing “Emergency Response Plan.” At AFRICON, General Carter Ham attempts to mount a rescue effort, but is told to “stand down.” By 10:30 PM an unarmed drone is overhead the compound and streaming live feed to various Command

The standout feature of the jersey is the traditional soccer sash featuring a modern design that incorporates both a star from the US flag and the leaf from the Canadian flag to commemorate the two nations that make up the league. The same sash design is also found on the neck taping.

The primary colors of the shirt are red, white and blue in a nod to the new MLS crest, which features those same colors. The three stars that make up the MLS logo are also present on the back of the All-Star jersey with the words identifying the three league pillars they represent: "Club, Country, Community" (below, right).

It's also a special 20th-season shirt, celebrating the league's history with a jock tag on the lower left area of the authentic shirts (below, left).

<|begin_of_text|>A few days ago, I wrote about one of the dumbest supposedly major controversies in a while, which was one SEVENTEEN member supposedly telling a fan that she was basically his source of income and two others saying that she was a fan of another member. I figured that would be sorta it (because I am a dumbass) since it was either: 1) Fabricated 2) A joke 3) Telling the truth. However, of course things started to snowball because the accusation had to do with disrespect from an idol to a fan.

SEVENTEEN fans ended up claiming it was fabricated because Seungkwan‘s signature looks different, but as far as I’m concerned there was nothing conclusive about that. Of course, the same applies to the accuser’s clarifications, which don’t actually prove anything either, yet people are taking her story as solid evidence for whatever reason.

As far as I see it, we’re thus basically back to the battle of narratives. Yet the reason I’m skeptical of her side of the story is that there was a recording she made with Jeonghan that was supposed to make him some kind of dickhead.

Fansite recording of Junghan

Fan: Today’s dress code…

Junghan: Stop coming here.

Fan: (2 seconds pause) Huh…? OK.. But I keep getting picked though.

Junghan: Then other fans can’t come. Stop coming.

What an asshole, right?

But the reality of that exchange was basically what I thought the Seungkwan incident was all about, which was idols joking around with fans who show up all the time.

<|begin_of_text|>Amazon To Hachette And Authors: Here, Let Us Explain Basic Price Elasticity To You

from the lower-price,-make-more-money-dimwits dept

A key objective is lower e-book prices. Many e-books are being released at $14.99 and even $19.99. That is unjustifiably high for an e-book. With an e-book, there's no printing, no over-printing, no need to forecast, no returns, no lost sales due to out-of-stock, no warehousing costs, no transportation costs, and there is no secondary market -- e-books cannot be resold as used books. E-books can be and should be less expensive.

It's also important to understand that e-books are highly price-elastic. This means that when the price goes up, customers buy much less. We've quantified the price elasticity of e-books from repeated measurements across many titles. For every copy an e-book would sell at $14.99, it would sell 1.74 copies if priced at $9.99. So, for example, if customers would buy 100,000 copies of a particular e-book at $14.99, then customers would buy 174,000 copies of that same e-book at $9.99. Total revenue at $14.99 would be $1,499,000. Total revenue at $9.99 is $1,738,000.

The important thing to note here is that at the lower price, total revenue increases 16%. This is good for all the parties involved: The customer is paying 33% less.

The author is getting a royalty check 16% larger and being read by an audience that's 74% larger. And that 74% increase in copies sold makes it much more likely that the title will make it onto the national bestseller lists. (Any author who's trying to get on one of the national bestseller lists should insist to their publisher that their e-book be priced at $9.99 or lower.)

Likewise, the higher total revenue generated at $9.99 is also good for the publisher and the retailer. At $9.99, even though the customer is paying less, the total pie is bigger and there is more to share amongst the parties. Keep in mind that books don't just compete against books. Books compete against mobile games, television, movies, Facebook, blogs, free news sites and more. If we want a healthy reading culture, we have to work

Oct. 23, 2017, 12:39 PM GMT / Updated Oct. 23, 2017, 12:39 PM GMT By Chuck Todd, Mark Murray and Carrie Dann

First Read is your briefing from Meet the Press and the NBC Political Unit on the day's most important political stories and why they matter.

GOP wrestles with tax politics — but what about the policy?

WASHINGTON — On a conference call Sunday afternoon with House Republicans, NBC’s Kasie Hunt reports, President Trump issued this warning: The GOP needs to pass his tax plan or it will lose in the 2018 midterms.

Failure, he said, would be “really bad” for the party in next year’s elections, while success would be “like skating on ice.”

But that focus on the tax plan’s electoral politics — when the midterm cake is already being baked — ignores the more important policy questions right now.

Will the GOP tax plan really RAISE taxes on middle-class and upper-middle-class Americans? Given that the initial plan eliminates personal exemptions (replaced by a larger standard deduction), the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center said one-quarter of American taxpayers would pay higher taxes by 2027, including 30 percent with incomes between $50,000 and $150,000 and 60 percent of those making between $150,000 and $300,000.

How much will the plan add to the deficit? The Treasury Department announced Friday that the federal budget deficit increased to $666 billion in the just-completed fiscal year – up from $585 billion last year. And that’s significant, because the Tax Policy Center says the GOP tax plan would reduce revenues by $2.4 trillion over the first 10 years (or $240 billion per year).

How much will the wealthy benefit vs. everyone else? Since the GOP proposal, among other things, eliminates the estate tax and lowers taxes for “pass-through” businesses, the same Tax Policy Center says that more than half of the benefits in the first year go to the Top 1 percent of taxpayers, while 30 percent of the benefits will go to the Top 0.1 percent.

Are Republicans really going to tax 401k accounts? That has been one of the trial balloons that Republicans have released. “The proposals under discussion would potentially cap the annual amount workers can set aside to as low as $2,400 for 401(k) accounts,

WASHINGTON — Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall, in congressional testimony Wednesday, defended the controversial path to end the US reliance on Russian rocket engines for military space launch—and Senate appropriators signaled their continued support.

That path, for now, involves using more of the engines while the industrial base ramps up to offer competing engines. DoD could replace the RD-180 engines by 2021 at the soonest, but the politicization of the issue is slowing down needed Congressional action, Kendall, the undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics, said at a Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee hearing Wednesday.

"It's a complicated issue, but the [Defense] Department's goals have never changed, to develop two engines, so if one of them has a failure, and we have a big gap in capability, we still have access to space," Kendall said. "We need competition to keep the expense down."

Ultimately, DoD will seek public-private partnerships for reasonably priced launch services, versus buying a lone replacement engine and subsidizing a single company, Kendall said. Replacing the Atlas V with a combination of ULA's Delta IV heavy launch system would cost, Kendall said, as much as $50 million per launch.

"It would be over $1 billion out of our defense budget to get us off RD-180s, and I don't think that's a good tradeoff," Kendall said.

The US Air Force contracts for launch services with United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which uses the RD-180 rocket engine to power its Atlas V launch vehicles. SpaceX is ULA's main competition for Pentagon business, as the company's Falcon 9 rocket won certification last year to compete for military space launches.

<|begin_of_text|>With all the cowardly decisions, especially the recent National Anthem enforcement and the concussions (CTE) deceptions, the real question is: Why does Roger Goodell make $44 mil a year for running the NFL, a monopoly sanctioned by Congress?

Maybe the NFL is in cahoots with Washington to distract the citizenry from lawmakers’ own doings, much like the “bread and circuses” of ancient Rome. Football diverts attention and placates the masses. (It’s also said to satisfy men’s innate lust for war but, just to make sure, Washington has us in a bunch of real wars, too.)

Trump, to his credit, clearly loves football; why else would he wear that helmet hair? But getting rid of the taxpayer-subsidized, tax-exempt status, antitrust exemptions, etc. of the NFL would be a good move for Trump right now.

With all its revenues, why can’t the NFL stand on its own? Anheuser-Busch alone paid $1.4 billion for NFL rights. If you want to sell beer to 18-34-year-old males, the NFL’s the place. If you want to sell power tools, also advertise on the NFL, although maybe also the WNBA.

The American justice system, like the NFL, has tons of laws and rules, often laws layered upon laws by the ruling classes so they can prosecute whom they want, when they want, for whatever they want. Thus, it is within the power of the NFL and its beleaguered commissioner, Roger Goodell, to pursue one thing and not another. Just ask “Deflate-gate” victim Tom Brady.

Goodell has had a long string of odd decisions. He toyed with penalties for uttering the N-word or sexist slurs. Yet he weighed free speech issues and reached a compromise: Players can listen to rap music but are not allowed to sing along.

Goodell has dictatorially tinkered with some rules; he once decreed that players can no longer celebrate TDs by dunking the football over the goalpost crossbars. That didn’t go over well. If Americans wanted to watch a sport with no dunking, we’d watch Ivy League college basketball.

Goodell threatened North Carolina and threatened to pull the Super Bowl from Arizona over legislation he viewed as anti-gay. He didn’t follow through with his threat, but the publicity dashed any hopes Arizona or North Carolina had of hosting the Tony Awards. And the gay rodeo business is non-existent

With Donald Trump's the US President-elect, this year's awareness month could potentially be the most important SAAM to date, as the future of Sikh Americans hangs in the balance, said Sikh Coalition community development manager Harjit Kaur. She said minority communities across the nation have experienced an uptick in hate crimes, bullying, and discrimination as a result of the current political climate.A series of Sikh-related events were organised through the month, from local activities in schools to collaborating with the basketball team, the Los Angeles Clippers.Sikh Coalition community development manager Harjit Kaur explains how it all came about. “Since November 2010, California community leaders have engaged with legislators to recognize the contribution of Sikh Americans to California and to provide a platform to create aware ness about Sikhs in California educational institutions and the community.“ Harjit elaborates, “This year, Assembly member Jim Cooper presented Dr Onkar Singh Bindra and me with the state member resolution celebrating Sikh Awareness and Appreciation Month. California state superintendent of public instruction Tom Torlakson also recognised November as the awareness month for California's public schools. Sikh Awareness and Appreciation resolutions have been passed in Yuba City, Fresno, San Jose, Bakersfield, Fremont, Santa Cruz, and Santa Clara, along with numerous school districts across the state.The Sikh Coalition, along with many volunteers, has delivered presentations to hundreds of Californians across the state in classrooms and local libraries.The Sikh Coalition also co-hosted a Sikh Awareness and Appreciation game with the Los Angeles Clippers.Over 350 Sikh Americans attended the LA Clippers game alongside the other 19,000 spectators. It also featured the US national anthem by Raaginder `Violinder' Singh on the violin as well as the Los Angeles Sikh Boy Scouts of America colour guard, and half-time entertainment by Da Real Punjabiz.Harjeet said they work tirelessly to ensure that SAAM is used as a platform to meaningfully engage with legislators, educators, and community members across the state to address these issues. “This year, after helping to protect Sikh history in California in July, the Sikh Coalition secured safe passage of AB-2845, a groundbreaking new anti-bullying law in California in September“.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>WASHINGTON–John McCain is the latest high-profile politician to repeat the diehard American falsehood that the 9/11 terrorists entered the United States through Canada. Just days after Janet Napolitano, the U.S. homeland security secretary, sparked a diplomatic kerfuffle by suggesting the terrorists took a Canadian route to the U.S. eight years ago, McCain defended her by saying that, in fact, the former Arizona governor was correct. "Well, some of the 9/11 hijackers did come through Canada, as you know," McCain, last year's Republican presidential candidate, said on Fox News on Friday. The Arizona senator's remarks prompted the Canadian embassy to immediately reissue remarks made earlier this week by Ambassador Michael Wilson, who reminded Americans once again that no 9/11 perpetrators came to the U.S. via Canada. "Unfortunately, misconceptions arise on something as fundamental as where the 9/11 terrorists came from," Wilson said.

Article Continued Below

"As the 9/11 Commission reported in July 2004, all of the 9/11 terrorists arrived in the U.S. from outside North America. They flew to major U.S. airports. They entered the U.S. with documents issued to them by the U.S. government. No 9/11 terrorists came from Canada." Crestfallen embassy officials contacted McCain's office soon after his Fox News remarks to set the record straight. McCain, an avid supporter of NAFTA and a powerful friend to Canada on Capitol Hill, recently visited the Canadian Embassy and had lunch with Wilson. The normally reserved Wilson made his 9/11 remarks on Tuesday following a CBC interview in which Napolitano appeared to believe that the hijackers entered the U.S. from Canada.

She later said she had misunderstood a question asked during the interview and was well aware there had been no Canadian 9/11 connection, but added that the Canada-U.S. border had, in the past, posed a security risk to Americans. The next day, Napolitano appeared at a border conference and suggested Canada was more lax in its immigration policies than the U.S., alleging Canadian authorities allow people into the country that would not pass muster south of the border. Napolitano has also ruffled diplomatic feathers with her insistence that the Canadian border must not be treated any differently than the U.S.-Mexican boundary, where a drug war rages and countless illegal immigrants flood into America every year. McCain expressed some sympathy for Canada on that front on Friday.

Today, it's launching a new service aimed at winning over the most paranoid of corporate customers. The service is a first step toward doing for network security what Amazon Web Services and other public cloud services have done for application services—replacing on-premises hardware with virtualized services spread across the Internet.

Called Keyless SSL, the new service allows organizations to use Cloudflare’s network of 28 data centers around the world to defend against distributed denial of service attacks on their websites without having to turn over private encryption keys. Keyless SSL breaks the encryption “handshake” at the beginning of a Transport Layer Security (TLS) Web session, passing part of the data back to the organization’s data center for encryption. It then negotiates the session with the returned data and acts as a gateway for authenticated sessions—while still being able to screen out malicious traffic such as denial of service attacks.

In an interview with Ars, Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince said that the technology behind Keyless SSL could help security-minded organizations embrace other cloud services while keeping a tighter rein on them. “If you decide you’re going to use cloud services today, how you set policy across all of these is impossible," he said. "Now that we can do this, fast forward a year, and we can do things like data loss prevention, intrusion detection… all these things are just bytes in the stream, and we’re already looking at them.”

All of that puts Cloudflare on a path to, as Prince put it, do to Cisco and other network hardware suppliers what AWS and other cloud services have done to Hewlett-Packard and Dell-type server vendors. The technology could also help extend Internet services to areas of the world that lack the sort of trustworthy data centers that Cloudflare and other cloud providers operate from, as it keeps their most precious secrets locked away back at the core of their networks.

Changing the locks

The development of Keyless SSL began about two years ago, on the heels of a series of massive denial of service attacks against major financial institutions alleged to have been launched from Iran. “We got a series of fairly frantic calls from those banks saying they needed help with this problem,” Prince said. “We met with JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs… pretty much everyone in that community. They described to us a challenge that put them between a rock and a hard place. They had spent billions on hardware

1. In a sexual harassment special investigation by former NJ Deputy Attorney General Lee Vartan, Tom McKay was found to have sexually harassed the Township clerk and a rent leveling board volunteer by describing them as lesbians and calling them “man-haters”. McKay never apologized to either woman, but rather blames his actions on his political opponents. The investigation costs Lopatcong taxpayers more than $10,000 and the council must censure the mayor. CensureResolution

2. Tom McKay is served with a Tort Claims notice of intent to sue subjecting the Township and its taxpayers to substantial liability for his sexual harassment behavior.

3. Tom McKay gavels Councilwoman Maureen McCabe in a public meeting and yells at her to “shut up.” Again, he refuses to take responsibility for losing his temper.

4. Tom McKay publicly posts his personal “10 Commandments” for behavior at public meetings, but when a resident posts beside it her 10 criticisms of his public demeanor, he has them removed. The town receives legal notice from the resident’s lawyer that the Mayor violated her First Amendment rights.

5. Tom McKay secretly secured access to the Township’s security cameras without the knowledge or consent of the Council. He also accepted those services as a gift from a Township vendor in violation of his terms of office.

6. Lopatcong Township loses its credit status with many of its vendors due to the Mayor’s refusal to pay bills on time. Many vendors take a “payment in advance” policy with the Township.

7. Tom McKay refused to consider the request led by Councilwoman Ciesla to refinance to Township’s debt obligation, for spite not business, and COST Lopatcong taxpayers $200,000.

8. Tom McKay’s politically motivated banking decisions COST Lopatcong $20,000 in lost revenues.

9. Tom McKay offered to trade his vote to reappoint the Township’s attorney and engineer for promises that they will not contribute to his opponents’ political campaign.

10. Tom McKay replaces a long time member of the Township Planning Board with a non-US citizen political ally who, at public meetings, refuses to Pledge Allegiance to the US Flag.

11. Tom McKay attempts to appoint his personal sexual harassment defense lawyer as the Township’s new labor lawyer. When the Council objects, he sues them.

12. Tom McKay attempts to appoint his personal attorney as the Township’s new general attorney

Well, let’s start with the positive: the Manning Centre organizers kept their promise to deliver a “unique” debate experience, at least in contrast to the majority of the fourteen-wide face-offs that have characterized the race so far.

Instead of lining the stage from curtain to curtain with candidates, they drew names from a hat and called them on stage in groups—two groups of four and two groups of three—with one topic per mini-slot, complete with answers, rebuttals and even the occasional outbursts of direct interaction between the candidates.

Serving as moderator was the inimitable Tom Clark, who signed off his journalistic duties at Global News earlier this year to take up a government relations gig at Global Public Affairs, but handled his brief return to the interview chair with ease and obvious enjoyment, even—or possibly especially—when he was obliged to cut the mic on an overly loquacious contestant.

(Those TV host reflexes stay sharp for at least a few months after hanging up the earpiece, apparently.)

What was clear, however, from the post-debate chatter at the meet-the-candidate reception that capped off the official conference activities for the day, was that it still wasn’t enough to knock the contestants off script and into the sort of spontaneous, off-the-cuff exchange of views that can, in a nanosecond, change the course of a campaign and, eventually, Canadian political history.

Forget “no knockout punches”—except for a few brief back-and-forths over health care (Chris Alexander and Kellie Leitch), trade negotiations (Lisa Raitt and Maxime Bernier) and the Canadian bona fides of Kevin O’Leary (O’Leary, Andrew Scheer and Deepak Obhrai)—the candidates were far too focused on delivering their now familiar applause and laugh lines.

Leitch reminded everyone of her plan for face-to-face screenings at border crossings. Scheer praised pipelines. Chong defended his proposal for a “revenue neutral carbon tax.” Bernier decried supply management. O’Leary raged over deficits and taxes—particularly provincial. Andrew Saxton reminded everyone he was, and is, a businessman. Brad Trost and Pierre Lemieux—who, by

History [ edit ]

LexisNexis office in Markham, a suburb of Toronto, Ontario, Canada

LexisNexis is currently owned by RELX Group (formerly known as Reed Elsevier).[6]

The story of LexisNexis starts in western Pennsylvania in 1956, when attorney John Horty began to explore the use of CALR technology in support of his work on comparative hospital law at the University of Pittsburgh Health Law Center.[7] In 1965, Horty's pioneering work inspired the Ohio State Bar Association (OSBA) to develop its own separate CALR system, Ohio Bar Automated Research (OBAR).[8] In 1967, the OSBA signed a contract with Data Corporation, a local defense contractor, to build OBAR based on the OSBA's written specifications.[8] Data proceeded to implement OBAR on Data Central, an interactive full-text search system originally developed in 1964 as Recon Central to help U.S. Air Force intelligence analysts search text summaries of the contents of aerial and satellite reconnaissance photographs.[9]

In 1968, paper manufacturer Mead Corporation purchased Data Corporation for $6 million to gain control of its inkjet printing technology.[10] Mead hired the Arthur D. Little firm to study the business possibilities for the Data Central technology.[10] Arthur D. Little dispatched a team of consultants to Ohio led by H. Donald Wilson.[11] Mead asked for a practicing lawyer on the team, so the team included Jerome Rubin, a Harvard-trained attorney with 20 years of experience.[12] The resulting study concluded that the nonlegal market was nonexistent, the legal market had potential, and OBAR needed to be rebuilt to profitably exploit that market.[12] At the time, OBAR searches often took up to five hours to complete if more than one user was online, and its original terminals (replaced with CRT text terminals in 1970) were noisy Teletypes with slow transmission rates of 10 characters per second.[13] OBAR also had quality control issues; Rubin later recalled that its data was “

<|begin_of_text|>This book has gotten a lot of flack for two reasons: (1) A number of people were upset by the large amount of errata posted after the book came out. (2) A number of people were upset by the perceived power-creep that this book carried with it, especially in the archetype section.

Both of these are reasonable complaints that I largely agree with.

That said, this book also contains a cornucopia of player options that are great fun. A number of the classes it introduced are now mainstream: it’s hard to imagine playing the game without options like the Brawler, the Investigator, the Slayer, the Bloodrager, the Hunter, or the Warpriest. Or to play without archetypes like the Bolt Ace (Gunslinger), Mutation Warrior or Martial Master (Fighter).

Moreover, the book introduced a number of feats that improve on the available build options available to most players (Extra Hex! Slashing Grace!). Likewise, although the spells in this book seem to have flown under the radar, there are a lot of nice and interesting spells are introduced in this book (Glue Seal, Communal Align Weapon, Wall of Blindness/Deafness, Wall of Nausea, Anti-Incorporeal Shell, Adjustable Disguise, Adjustable Polymorph, Investigative Mind, etc).

Easily 5 stars worth of good material here. Given the unusually large amount of errata, I feel compelled to deduct a star. But all that said, it’s hard to imagine playing Pathfinder without this book -- after the Core Rulebook and Advanced Players Guide, it’s probably the best book for players to pick up.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Following news last week that EPA had allowed for the re-introduction of asbestos into the construction market, architects across the country have lambasted the proposal, calling for a blanket ban on asbestos. In response, the environmental agency has issued the following statement:

“The EPA accepts the blanket ban on asbestos and will under no circumstances permit the production of asbestos blankets, but other asbestos products may be used where there is significant desire to do so because after all, asbestos is the best osTM #MAGA.”

In addition to this statement, the EPA released a full list of materials granted SNUR (Significant New Use Rule) status following a year-long safety inquiry. The document can be seen below.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

NOTIFICATION OF SIGNIFICANT NEW USE RULES FOR PROHIBITED MATERIALS:

Structural Cheese: With asbestos back on the menu, so is cheese. Once again, certain cheeses will be classified as safe for construction. Any cheese harder than an average supermarket cheddar will once again be permitted for use in structural members for public and governmental buildings no larger than a soccer stadium. Many of these cheeses have been consistently described as ‘robust’, ‘extra strong’ and ‘particularly tangy’ and so are clearly suitable for supporting extremely heavy loads. For obvious reasons, mozzarella is banned for construction use in pizza shops and all cheese is banned from mice farms. The EPA would like to clarify that this cheese legislation has nothing to do with the 1.4 billion-pound surplus of cheese in the U.S.

Napkin Tiling: To combat the wasteful practice of discarding unused restaurant-grade napkins, the EPA will classify them as suitable for tiling bathrooms and wet-rooms. The famous slogan “one sheet does plenty” clearly applies to the use of napkins as bathroom tiles, and they are marketed as “super-absorbent” so are perfect for use in areas that tend to get excessively wet. They are also often folded into the shape of boats, or swans, so are clearly waterproof. Napkins with scribbles and doodles on them will not be permitted.

Chocolate Fire Doors: In order to drastically cut deforestation in North America the EPA proposes to drastically increase deforestation in South America. This can be done by doubling chocolate production in South American countries. This surplus chocolate will be used in the construction of fire-rated door sets. In the event of a fire, conventional timber doors catch fire, and fire is well known to be the leading cause of fire. Chocolate

A woman who kept a £20 note she found in a shop has been convicted of theft.

Nicole Bailey, 23, picked up the cash at a branch of One Stop, in Blurton, Stoke-on-Trent, after it was dropped by a customer who withdrew it from a nearby cash machine, police said.

Bailey pleaded guilty at North Staffordshire Justice Centre after seeing CCTV evidence.

Her defence team reportedly argued the case should have been dealt with through a police caution.

Bailey, of Highfield Drive, Blurton, must also pay £20 compensation, a £20 victim surcharge and £135 in court costs.

More updates on this and other stories in Staffordshire

What do you do if you find £20?

The theft occurred on 8 August last year.

Ch Insp Karen Stevenson, from Staffordshire Police, urged anyone who finds lost money to "do the right thing".

"Morally, the right thing to do is hand in any found property so that the person who has lost out has every opportunity to be reunited with it."

"This was someone's hard-earned money and we are committed to supporting all victims in our community."

The US Soccer national team today finally unveiled its new logo. Following the design language established by the overwhelmingly popular centenary crest, the new US Soccer logo boasts the US national teams' iconic navy and red in a sleek arrangement. This is the new US Soccer badge, introduced on February 29, 2016.Drawing inspiration from the previous US Soccer logo's badge shape, the new USA national team crest simplifies a lot elements of the old crest, while also shifting the colors to darker and less cartoony shades of blue and red.The three stars and the ball from the 1993 crest have been ditched, making place for a bold navywriting at the top of the badge. Dynamic red stripes adorn the lower half of the new USA soccer logo.Barely changed since its creation in 1993 and often mocked for its outdated 1990s look, the US Soccer badge has been in need for a redesign for a long time. Building on the success of the centenary crest seems a very viable and logical decision, in the interest of the US national team's fans.After Nike and US Soccer renewed their kit supplier contract until 2022, the two worked side by side on the new US Soccer badge, which is set to be first used on the new United States 2016 Home and Away Kits. The new USA Jerseys are set to be worn at the first-ever Copa America on US-soil, the 2016 centenary tournament.What do you think of the new 2016 USA national team logo?

<|begin_of_text|>The twelve-sided Australian fifty-cent coin is the third-highest denomination coin of the Australian dollar and the largest in terms of size in circulation. It is the only 12-sided coin of its size in the southern hemisphere. It was introduced in 1969 [2] to replace the round fifty-cent coin issued in 1966.

The original, round, 50-cent coin was made of 80% silver and 20% copper; but as the value of a free-floating silver price became higher, the coin's bullion value became more valuable than its face value; so that version was withdrawn from circulation and replaced with the dodecagonal cupro-nickel version.

It is by diameter the largest Australian coin currently issued and second largest after the Crown of 1937–38. It is also the heaviest Australian coin in common circulation. Many commemorative designs have been issued, the large size allowing for detailed content.

With a diameter of 31.65 mm (1.25 in), the 50-cent coin is one of the largest in volume among those currently circulating in the world. Coins of larger diameter include the Costa Rican five-hundred-colones and the fifty-CFP Franc, both 32.9 mm.

Five-cent, ten-cent, twenty-cent, and fifty-cent coins are legal tender up to the sum of $5.[3]

Obverse [ edit ]

As with all coins of Australia, the reigning monarch features on the obverse. Only Elizabeth II has been monarch during the coin's existence.

Unlike other decimal denominations, four different portraits of Her Majesty have been used on 50c coins. A unique effigy by Vladimir Gottwald was used for the 2000 Royal Visit commemorative fifty-cent piece.[4][5] This is the only Australian decimal coin to have an obverse designed by an Australian[6] and to have a portrait of the queen which is not also used on British currency.

The other three portraits have featured on all then-current denominations: from 1966 to 1984 one by Arnold Machin,[7] from 1985 to 1998 one by Raphael Maklouf,[8] and since 1999 a portrait by Ian Rank-Broadley.[9] These portraits were introduced to British coins in 1968, 1985, and 1998 respectively.[10]

Commemorative coins [ edit ]

The Australian fifty-cent coin was the first to display a variation of the reverse design in 1970 for the commemorating

<|begin_of_text|>Verizon is getting rid of contract plans, switching its offerings over to month-to-month plans like AT&T and T-Mobile did before it. Verizon's new plans are all based around shared data buckets — there's no single line or family plan. Instead, subscribers pay for a specific amount of data and then pay a per-device fee to hook it into the plan.

Everyone loves per-line access fees!

The options include 1GB for $30 per month, 3GB for $45 per month, 6GB for $60 per month, and 12GB for $80 per month. Adding a smartphone to the plan is $20 per month, adding a tablet or hotspot is $10 per month, and adding a smartwatch is $5 per month. Verizon says that larger plans will be available for those who want them; for those who just need a little bit of extra data one month, Recode reports that they'll be stuck paying $15 for an extra gigabyte, though they can always jump up to a new plan the next month. As usual, the pricing is not really friendly or tailored for anyone, but Verizon is under the odd impression that it's easier to understand.

The plans go live next Thursday, on August 13th. Current Verizon subscribers will be able to hang onto their existing plans or switch over to the new plans "with some restrictions."

Though doing away with contracts is a big shift, it's something we've seen coming. T-Mobile kicked off the trend about two years ago, and AT&T began following it recently by dropping contract offerings from third-party sellers. Alongside the shift away from contracts is the shift away from subsidized phones, meaning that people are going to need to start buying phones at full price or using carriers' payment plans. Verizon has been offering such a plan under the name Edge, though it's now decided to rename it "device payment option," which actually is easier to understand.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Former President Jimmy Carter broke away from his own party, coming to President Donald Trump’s defense and saying, “The media have been harder on Trump than any other president.”

In a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times published on Saturday, Carter seemed to ally himself with Trump, criticizing the media for its coverage of the new administration.

[lz_ndn video=”33150334″]

“I think the media have been harder on Trump than any other president certainly that I’ve known about,” Carter told The Times. “I think they feel free to claim that Trump is mentally deranged and everything else without hesitation.”

In addition, Carter also aligned himself with Trump on the issue of whether or not football players should stand while the national anthem is being played before games. Trump reignited the controversy in late September when he urged football coaches to bench players who choose to protest against racial injustice in the country by kneeling instead of standing during the anthem. Since then, National Football League ratings have plummeted while many sports fans expressed their disapproval of kneeling during the anthem and politicizing a patriotic tradition.

“I think they ought to find a different way to object, to demonstrate. I would rather see all the players stand during the American anthem,” Carter said.

The former president also pushed back against one of the prevailing narratives Democrats and liberal-leaning media outlets have pushed in the days following Trump’s astonishing Election Day victory: whether or not the Russians affected voting outcomes. In addition, Carter said he wasn’t bothered particularly with Trump’s desire to cultivate a stronger and more diplomatic relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“At the Carter Center,” the former president said, “we deal with Putin and the Russians quite frequently concerning Syria.”

Carter added: “I don’t think there’s any evidence that what the Russians did changed enough votes, or any votes” during the 2016 presidential election.

Noting that he and his wife, Rosalynn, both voted for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) over Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during the primaries, Carter didn’t have many kind words to offer the Clintons. When The Times’ Maureen Dowd compared the Carter Center to the Clinton Foundation, Carter bristled.

<|begin_of_text|>The FBI has been lobbying top internet companies like Yahoo and Google to support a proposal that would force them to provide backdoors for government surveillance, according to CNET.

The Bureau has been quietly meeting with representatives of these companies, as well as Microsoft (which owns Hotmail and Skype), Facebook and others to argue for a legislative proposal, drafted by the FBI, that would require social-networking sites and VoIP, instant messaging and e-mail providers to alter their code to make their products wiretap-friendly.

The FBI has previously complained to Congress about the so-called "Going Dark" problem – the difficulty of doing effective wiretap surveillance as more communications have moved from traditional telephone services to internet service companies.

Under the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or CALEA, passed in 1994, telecommunications providers are required to make their systems wiretap-friendly. The Federal Communications Commission extended CALEA in 2004 to apply to broadband providers like ISPs and colleges, but web companies are not covered by the law.

CNET reports that in addition to this push from the FBI, the Federal Communications Commission may be looking at reinterpreting CALEA to demand that video and non-telephone-replacement VoIP products such as Skype and Xbox Live be modified to include backdoors that allow FBI surveillance.

The news comes on the heels of another FBI plan that began kicking around in 2010 that would require backdoors in encrypted communication systems. That proposal, which would revisit the encryption wars of the 1990s, has failed to gather administration backing.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

British media organisations have been forced to make a string of corrections and retractions over recent months relating to coverage of Muslims following routine monitoring.

Miqdaad Versi, an assistant general secretary of the Muslim Council of Britain, has undertaken a personal project to track articles about Islam and Muslims in order to spot misrepresentations and inaccuracies.

He has secured almost 20 corrections and retractions, and a further 20 complaints are being examined by the press regulator, Ipso. Several complaints have been rejected.

Among the published corrections was a story published on the Sun website last week, originally headlined: “SUPERMARKET TERROR: Gunman ‘screaming Allahu Akbar’ opens fire in Spanish supermarket while ‘carrying bag filled with petrol and gunpowder’.”

After Versi complained, the headline was changed to “SUPERMARKET HORROR: Gunman opens fire in Spanish supermarket while ‘carrying bag filled with petrol and gunpowder’.”

The corrected text included a denial by local police and a spokesperson for the supermarket chain that the suspect had shouted “Allahu Akbar”. The Sun appended an apology to the story. Neither the Mail nor the Express corrected similar headlines.

Another was a story published on Mail Online suggesting the murder of a Muslim mother had been motivated by religion. The original headline said: “Mother of four stabbed to death while her family were at a funeral ‘may have been murdered in Islamic honour killing’.”

Versi complained to the news organisation, saying “honour killings” were rooted in culture not religion. Mail Online amended its headline to: “Mother of four stabbed to death while her family were at a funeral ‘may have been murdered in honour killing’”, and added a footnote stating: “An earlier version of this article said that police were investigating whether Ms Khan may have been murdered in an ‘Islamic honour killing’. We are happy to make clear that Islam as a religion does not support so-called ‘honour killings’.”

He also complained to Ipso, which ruled that the phrase “Islamic honour killing” suggested that “the killing had been motivated by Islam, when there was no basis for saying that religion had played a role in this killing”.

The Express corrected a headline claiming religious groups could ban the new £5 note because the Bank of England could not promise they were halal. The new version read: “New £5 could be BANNED by religious

Viewership for the primetime game between the Washington Redskins and the Oakland Raiders was down on NBC by 11 percent from the same night one year ago and 9 percent from the previous week, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The media outlet reports the game averaged an 11.6 household rating. Fox saw a 16 percent decrease in ratings for the NFL afternoon game, according to Forbes.

However, ratings for CBS were up 4 percent from last year's Week 3 coverage, according to a CBS Sports press release.

The less-than-stellar ratings came after President Trump slammed the NFL during a rally in Alabama on Friday, saying players who protest the national anthem should be fired.

Possibly taking away viewers from NBC's "SNF" WAS CBS' 50th anniversary season premiere of "60 Minutes" with Oprah Winfrey and the only broadcast of the new "Star Trek Discovery."

These were top markets for "Sunday Night Football," according to Deadline:

<|begin_of_text|>The U.S. One Cent coin, or penny, has almost no purchasing power today. The cost of making the pennies (1.66 cents each) is higher than face value, and the melt value of pennies ranges from more than two cents for the pre-1982 copper pennies, to nearly a full cent for the copper plated zinc pennies. However, the penny is a very sentimental coin to most Americans, and many people fear that eliminating the penny would raise prices because things would need to be rounded up to the nearest nickel.

Both sides in the penny debate make some good points, and the solution is far from being an easy decision. This article takes a look at the issues involved in the pro-penny and the anti-penny debate so that you can make up your mind about where you stand on this critical matter.

Background

The United States has eliminated a small denomination coin in the past with relatively little trouble. In 1857, the Mint stopped making the half-cent coin, partly because the cost of making it had exceeded its face value, and somewhat because it was considered to be too small a denomination that it was no longer needed.

Back in 1857, the half-cent had the purchasing power that would translate to well over ten cents today, so in some ways, it was akin to our eliminating the dime. Commerce continued without any major hiccups, even though the one-cent copper coin suddenly shrunk from a hefty, over an inch in diameter piece of copper that weighed almost 11 grams, to a penny that was less than half the weight and 40% smaller.

Other significant changes in U.S. coinage occurred without any catastrophic effects on commerce. In 1965 the U.S. Mint stopped making 90% silver dimes, quarters, and half dollars and changed them over to base metal clad versions. The outer shell was made out of 75% copper and 25% nickel bonded to a core of pure copper. A few people groused about it, but commerce continued unabated.

There have been several other minor changes in the coin metal composition. These composition changes ranged from temporary wartime alterations during World War II, to more permanent switches like using zinc instead of copper for the penny. More recently, the mint changed the cupro-nickel clad dollar coin (the Susan B. Anthony) to the "golden dollar" type used in the Sacagawea and Presidential Dollar types. None of these changes caused any significant problems in commerce.

The lower fee, in place for at least 40 years -- according to commissioner Lyall Schwarzkopf, who remembered it from when he was city clerk in 1972 -- had enabled candidates, in the absence of a primary, to make "a mockery" of recent mayoral elections, said Commissioner Devin Rice.

"We shouldn't overreact, but 35 candidates was ridiculous," said Commisisoner Jan Sandberg. "We absolutely have to do something about that filing fee."

The $20 fee is set by a state law which allows cities to adopt higher fees. The $20 fee applied to only four cities: Minneapolis, St. Paul, Duluth and Rochester. St. Paul had put a $50 fee in place, then raised that to $500 in 2010. Rochester's fee went from $25 to $50 in 1988. Duluth's? Still $20.

The new Minneapolis fees are intended to be entered into the overhauled city charter that voters overwhelmingly approved Tuesday. The revised charter takes effect in 2015. But first they have to go before the City Council, which can change them and send them back to the charter commission for another vote before they're entered into the charter. Commission chairman Barry CLegg said that if the council refuses to act, the proposal will go directly to voters in 2014. He said he'd expect overwhelming support.

Rice first proposed raising the mayoral filing fee to $300, pointing out that he didn't want to judge the seriousness of any candidate, but did want to make sure that they filed campaign finance reports, which a $100 expenditure triggers. He also said he didn't think it should cost more to file for mayor than it does for U.S. Senate ($500) and governor ($400).

But the rest of the board upped the ante, also raising the fee to enter a city council race from $20 to $250, and the fee to run for Park and Recreation Board and the Board of Estimate and Taxation from $20 to $100.

"$500 today is not a barrier," said Commissioner Todd Ferrara.

Twenty dollars in 1972 would be worth $111.70 today.

Candidate Bob "Again" Carney agreed that Tuesday's ballot was "cumbersome." He said the higher filing fee might have

Nik Stauskas and Tyler Ennis are envisioning the day when they all get together wearing Canada's national team jersey.

"I think, once we get in the gym together, getting chemistry and just get all the talent in one gym for the first time, I think that will be a big moment for Canada," Ennis said Thursday night at the NBA draft. "I think not only 2016, but the following Olympics I think we'll be able to make a run at it."

Stauskas, a long-range shooter from Mississauga, Ont., went eighth overall to the Sacramento Kings in Thursday night's draft at Barclays Center. Ennis, a point guard from Brampton, Ont., went 18th to the Phoenix Suns.

Andrew Wiggins, a 19-year-old sensation from Vaughan, Ont., was taken No. 1 overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers.

The Canadians were asked in their post-draft interviews if they think Canada can give perennial powerhouse United States a run for their money at the 2016 Rio Olympics.

"I talked with Andrew (Wiggins) the last couple of days, just being here in New York at the same time. We're very excited for the future of Canada basketball," Stauskas said. "I feel like, if we really all commit to coming in and working hard and coming together, I think we could have a really good team.

"I'm not saying we're going to win a gold medal right now, but I'm saying that we could have a chance to compete at that level if we really — if we all commit to it.

Dwight Powell of Toronto was the fourth Canadian drafted Thursday, going 45th overall to the Charlotte Hornets.

The first-round picks confirm Canada will have at least 12 players on NBA rosters next season — second most in the league behind the United States. Canada passed France, which previously held that honour with nine players on NBA rosters.

"It's such a tremendous night for Canadian Basketball. For Andrew, Nik and Tyler to go in the top 18 in such an incredibly deep draft makes such a compelling case for the development of the Canadian game," said Wayne Parrish, Canada Basketball's president and CEO.

The Egyptian government denied that terrorism is even a possibility, with Egyptian despot Abdel Fatah al-Sisi proclaiming:

“When there is propaganda that it crashed because of Isis, this is one way to damage the stability and security of Egypt and the image of Egypt. Believe me, the situation in Sinai – especially in this limited area – is under our full control.”

However, it soon came out that the person in charge of Sharm el-Sheikh airport, where the Russia plane had landed before taking off again, had been “replaced” – oh, but not because of anything to do with the downing of the Russian passenger plane! As the Egyptian authorities put it:

“Adel Mahgoub, chairman of the state company that runs Egypt’s civilian airports, says airport chief Abdel-Wahab Ali has been ‘promoted’ to become his assistant. He said the move late Wednesday had nothing to do with media skepticism surrounding the airport’s security. Mahgoub said Ali is being replaced by Emad el-Balasi, a pilot.”

Laughable, albeit in a sinister way, and yet more evidence that something wasn’t quite right: after all, everyone knows the Egyptian government does not have the Sinai, over which the plane disintegrated in mid air, under its “full control.” ISIS, which claimed responsibility for the crash hours after it occurred, is all over that peninsula.

Still, the denials poured in, mostly from US government officials such as Director of National Intelligence James “Liar-liar-pants-on-fire” Clapper, who said ISIS involvement was “unlikely.” Then they told us it couldn’t have been ISIS because they supposedly don’t have surface-to-air missiles that can reach the height attained by the downed plane. Yet that wasn’t very convincing either, because a) How do they know what ISIS has in its arsenal?, and b) couldn’t ISIS or some other group have smuggled a bomb on board?

The better part of a week after the crash, we have this:

“Days after authorities dismissed claims that ISIS brought down a Russian passenger jet, a U.S. intelligence analysis now suggests that the terror group or its affiliates planted a bomb on the plane.

“British Foreign Minister Philip Hammond said his government believes there is a ‘significant possibility’ that an explosive device caused the crash. And

NEW YORK - O No, Canada.

A Broadway performer botched the Canadian national anthem before the Toronto Raptors' game in Brooklyn on Sunday, singing lyrics that aren't in "O Canada."

Amber Iman, who has been cast in the national tour of "Hamilton" that will soon open, sang, "O Canada, we sing our hearts for thee." The line that ends the song is "O Canada, we stand on guard for thee."

Raptors players and coaches looked around in confusion as they stood in line.

"I'm going to leave that alone. But yeah, that anthem was a lot different than I've heard over the last five years. A lot different," Raptors All-Star Kyle Lowry said. "Her voice was beautiful, but the anthem, the song, the words... have her come to Toronto, we'll come and get somebody to give her some lessons."

The Raptors responded by poking fun at the Nets on Twitter, writing "For future reference" and posting the correct lyrics to the song.

The Nets apologized to the singer for the prompter failing according to a spokeswoman at the Barclays Center.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Several exhibition halls at the museum - located on Tashan Mountain in Shantou's Chenghai district - were adapted for other purposes, and all the stone tablets, memorial gateways and victims' tombs at the site were covered with cement, Hong Kong-based news site hkej.com reported Wednesday.

Peng Qi'an, founder of the museum and former vice mayor of Shantou, told the Global Times on Thursday that he had not entered the museum since its exhibits were covered.

"Since March, the materials [in the museum] had been covered by banners with core socialist values slogans. Then they were covered by cement, making them illegible," Peng told the Global Times.

When contacted by the Global Times for comment, an employee of the Chenghai district's publicity department said that she was unaware of the move. Shantou's publicity department was unable to be reached for comment as of press time.

A report published by Hong Kong's Ming Pao newspaper in May said signs showing the way to the museum had been covered with banners extolling the core socialist values and emblazoned with the Chinese national flag and the Party emblem.

A 20-meter-wide and 5-meter-high stone tablet in the museum's public square that was originally inscribed with the phrase "Take history as a mirror, do not let the tragedy of the Cultural Revolution repeat itself" had been replaced with enormous posters advocating the Chinese dream and core socialist values, the report added.

Peng began developing the site in the late 1990s, and construction of the museum was completed in 2005. The area is dotted with dozens of graves, memorial arches and marble memorials carved with passages from history texts that describe class struggle or violent deaths.

According to previous reports, it is allegedly China's only museum dedicated to the Cultural Revolution, and the local government neither supported nor opposed its construction.

Historians trace the start of the Cultural Revolution to May 16, 1966, when a conference of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) passed a circular in which Party leader Mao Zedong stated his belief that the power usurped by capitalist-roaders could be recaptured only by carrying out a great cultural revolution.

The DJ, whose name was later revealed to be Dave Lester, 32, from Lewisham, had been playing a sub-standard selection of repetitive tunes when a member of the crowd proceeded to the DJ booth. The crowd member was then seen talking into Lester’s ear, at which point the convulsions began at once.

“He started shaking uncontrollably straight away,” crowd member Jody Smith told us afterwards. “If I heard correctly, the dude leaned over and said to him, ‘I’m really enjoying your selection: top tech-house music.’ Then the DJ’s mouth started frothing with blood and foam, his eyes seemed to pop out of their sockets with anger, and his fists clenched as if he had suddenly become some hideous techno version of the Incredible Hulk. He then collapsed twitching onto the floor, screaming in a blood-curdling voice the words ‘Jeff Mills is not Tech-House!’ over and over again.”

As the convulsions continued, onlooker Andrew Harris, who later identified himself as a friend of the deceased, was one of the first on the scene.

“The sound technician has already jumped in and begun to administer CPR,” Harris told us, “but Dave simply squealed that the pumps to his chest were not being delivered in four to the floor time and physically threw him to one side. The sound technician responded by observing the fact that a techno tempo is too slow for effective CPR. It was at that point Dave simply exploded all over the concerned onlookers and over the decks.”

Lester was taken to hospital immediately afterwards, but was confirmed dead upon arrival. Doctors issued the following statement: “We’ve known about this condition, known in the medical journals as Techno Snobbery, for some time now, but this is the first time that we’ve ever seen anyone spontaneously combust with rage due to it.

“We would offer the following advice to techno DJs,” the statement continued. “Techno Snobbery is a condition that can often show no symptoms for many years, yet it has been documented that it can emerge suddenly at any time due to the slightest provocation. Therefore, techno DJs should remember that genre categorisations are largely permeable and superfluous, and that a fan referring to their music as Tech-House is therefore not a derogatory comment and can, in some circumstances

Following criticism of Mohammad Amir's early return to cricket after his spot-fixing ban, the ICC today announced the left-arm quick would only be allowed to bowl right-arm offspin in a long-sleeved top so "no one can ever forget he's a bit shifty".

There had been fears letting Amir back ahead of schedule sent a message his past behaviour was completely forgiven, but this latest sanction, the ICC believes, will ensure the Pakistani youngster will continue to be widely stigmatised because, in the words of one Dubai official, "everyone knows what these offspinners get up to".

Speaking outside the Indian Supreme Court, Head of the ICC Ethics Enforcement Unit, N Srinivasan, explained the idea: ''A lot of people were a bit miffed at us letting Amir come back early, so we decided to add an extra punishment to guarantee no one will ever, ever consider him above suspicion. We couldn't think of anything more likely to ruin his reputation in the current climate than forcing him to play as an offspinner.

"Well, we were toying with the idea of making him India's overseas bowling coach, but in the end we decided even a convicted felon didn't deserve that." The deputy head of the ICC Ethics Enforcement Unit, N Srinivasan, claimed that this was in no way another clever ruse from the Big Three to prevent other countries from having any decent bowlers whatsoever: ''We haven't insisted Wayne Parnell becomes an offspinner, have we?'' he argued convincingly.

Amir himself was understandably upset about the plan, taking to social media to suggest the shame of being imprisoned for spot-fixing was nothing compared to the disgrace of having to bowl offspin in 2015. After listing his profile location as "a small village", the fallen idol sent out a number of distraught tweets claiming he "couldn't stand all the whispering and finger-pointing'' to which he'd be subjected if he was forced to send down the same category of delivery as Mohammad Hafeez and Saeed Ajmal. Later he wrote: "It's one thing to be hated for deliberately conceding a no-ball and shattering the dreams of millions of cricket fans across the world. It's quite another to suffer the humiliation of having a portly man in an ill-fitting umpire's uniform declare your arm is a bit too bendy." New to Twitter, Amir eventually realised the

he election of Donald J. Trump revealed a bitterly divided nation and a large body of voters fed up with the status quo: fed up with a perennially ailing economy and a shrinking middle class; fed up with an overly intrusive state that crippled businesses with innumerable regulations and sought to redistribute wealth; fed up with a massively burdensome and insupportable debt; fed up with a president mentored by revolutionaries and malcontents who seemed not to like ordinary Americans much if at all; fed up with a leader who paid court to hostile foreign powers while alienating or outright betraying America's traditional allies; fed up with a president who spoke of heartland Americans as bitter people who cling to their guns or religion or bigotry; fed up with a president who told business owners "You didn't build that," called the Fort Hood terrorist attack an episode of workplace violence, and announced at the United Nations that the future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam; and most of all, perhaps, fed up with an administration that placed the whole country in thrall to political correctness, making a range of important subjects off-limits for discussion on pain of job loss or public disgrace. Many of these voters felt that America had changed beyond all recognition, had lost its core values, and that neither Republican nor Democrat politicians offered any real resistance to that, or even seemed to notice.Donald Trump promised to change everything: to make America great again; to revive American industry; to put Americans back to work and make it possible for them to feed their families and to have prosperity once again; to reduce burdensome taxes and over-regulation of businesses; to renew American patriotism and the traditional family; to stop pretending that children do just as well without a father and money; to stop pretending that masculinity is toxic; to make it acceptable and normal once more to love God and to celebrate America's Judeo-Christian heritage; to decrease the mass immigration that is changing the face of America for the worse; to root out the Muslim Brotherhood sympathizers who have been given key positions in the American administration; to halt illegal immigration and to put a stop to the sanctuary cities that make a mockery of American laws; to rebuild the American military and to signal American power, not acquiescence, to America's foes; to honor American veterans in a manner appropriate to their service; to renew ties with America's traditional allies; and to vigorously protect America from domestic and foreign terrorism.

“Starting today, the Department of Justice will do its part in this struggle. We will enforce federal law, defend free speech, and protect students’ free expression from whatever end of the political spectrum it may come,” Sessions told an audience of Georgetown students.

The speech marked the attorney general's entry into a raging national debate, largely over protesters effectively shutting down conservative speakers on American campuses.

During his remarks at Georgetown’s Constitution Center, the Justice Department simultaneously filed a statement of interest in a free-speech case siding with students who said their rights were limited.

“We will be filing more in the weeks and months to come,” Sessions said.

The case cited Tuesday was initially filed by students at Georgia Gwinnett College to challenge a policy limiting student expressive activity to two small “free-speech zones.”

The Justice Department argued that the college’s speech policies were not content-neutral and were not “narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest.”

“A national recommitment to free speech on campus and to ensuring First Amendment rights is long overdue,” Sessions said.

Ahead of Sessions' address, a group of more than 30 Georgetown law professors signed onto a letter condemning what they called “the hypocrisy” of Sessions' appearance. They cited President Trump's ongoing feud with NFL players who kneel during the anthem and other complaints about Sessions' DOJ.

“Attorney General Jeff Sessions is a key cabinet member in an administration headed by a President who spent last weekend denouncing athletes engaged in free expression and calling for them to be fired,” the professors wrote Monday night.

The professors went on to cite other examples of why they think Sessions is unfit to deliver this address, including his department's prosecution of a protester who disrupted his confirmation hearings.

In the question-and-answer exchange after Sessions’ remarks, the attorney general defended the president’s “free speech rights.”

“The president has free speech rights too. He sends soldiers out every day to defend this country, under the flag of the United States, under the national anthem,” Sessions said. “I agree there is a big mistake to protest in that fashion because it weakens the commitment we have to this nation that has provided us this freedom.”

Sessions added that while the players obviously are not subject to prosecution, they should be prepared to be condemned if they pursue a “provocative act.”

Even though it was large in size (38.1 to 40 mm), it was a popular denomination and circulated well due to its buying power. The "silver dollar" was discontinued in 1935. By the mid to late 1960's, the price of silver rose to the point that "silver dollars" no longer circulated. In 1971, due to the needs of gambling casinos for a dollar coin, and the public's desire to honor the first landing on the moon, the dollar coin was again struck, i.e. the Eisenhower Dollar. The coins failed to circulate widely, primarily due to their large size and the acceptance and convenience of the paper dollar.

SIDE-BY-SIDE SIZE COMPARISON OF AN EISENHOWER

DOLLAR (38.1 mm) AND A SUSAN B. ANTHONY DOLLAR (26.5 mm)

PHOTO COURTESY OF ROBERT EZERMAN In the mid 1970's, attention turned to a smaller size dollar coin, culminating in the Susan B. Anthony Dollar in 1979. Miss Anthony was chosen to honor her life long fight for women's suffrage. From day one the Anthony Dollar was rejected and ridiculed. The portrait was considered ugly and the coins were not easily distinguished from the quarter dollar. Besides being the same color, there was less than nine-hundredths of an inch difference in the diameters of the Anthony Dollar and the quarter dollar. They were given nicknames such as "Agony Dollars", "Carter Quarters", "Susan B. Edsel", and "JC Pennies" (Jimmy Carter was in the White House at the time). They were discontinued at that time after only being struck for circulation for two years, 1979 and 1980. The 1981 Anthony Dollars were struck for mint sets only. Curiously, this was not the first time this criticism was accorded a United States coin. In 1875 a Twenty-Cent piece was struck. Besides having virtually the same design as the quarter dollar, it was a mere eight-hundredths of an inch smaller. The Twenty-Cent piece ceased being struck for circulation in 1876

And I can’t think of a better term to describe the Conservative campaign brain trust at the midpoint of this long election season.

Just lately, for example, the campaign seems to be having a tiny problem with geography. Last Friday, a Harper tweet provided a lovely snapshot of Little Crater Lake in the state of Oregon to illustrate its commitment to the Canadian great outdoors. Earlier in the week, a campaign spot talked about shipbuilding in Halifax, N.S. … against a backdrop of Johnstown, Ont. A group of Colombian miners sat in for a party ad promoting a mineral exploration tax credit. And then there was the Tory ad which misidentified a B.C. salmon as its Atlantic cousin — the online trolls are still chuckling over that one.

Well, these things happen. So do things like a sudden drop in the polls to third place. If that’s not a wakeup call, I don’t know what qualifies.

It all made me think of an incident in the 2000 campaign, when Canadian Alliance Leader Stockwell Day lamented that Canadian talent and brains were heading south to the U.S., “just like the Niagara River.” The message was sound, the words were not; the Niagara actually flows northward.

Day took a lot of ungentle ribbing for that error — but his mistakes fade in comparison to the fiasco in the Big Blue Bus these days. There’s one common thread that links Day’s experience in 2000 to what Harper is going through right now: a profound sense of confusion on the ground. But that’s where the similarities end.

I worked on the Day campaign as legislative assistant to a front-bench MP. For the Alliance, the 2000 election was an unwelcome surprise from PM Jean Chretien, who always knew how to catch his opponents off guard. The CA had just been through a highly divisive leadership campaign and the party was low on funds. There was little corporate support for the party and many influential backers were waiting to see whether the Alliance could really replace the Progressive Conservatives as a centre-right alternative to the Liberals. Day fought that campaign on a shoestring, with family members playing key roles in the process.

The Conservative party is having more and more difficulty recruiting volunteers at the riding level. Even campaign stalwarts who show up for every election are finding reasons to stay home this time. Who

The flag of South Korea, also known as the Taegukgi (also spelled as Taegeukgi, literally "supreme ultimate flag"), has three parts: a white rectangular background, a red and blue Taegeuk, symbolizing balance, in its center, and four black trigrams selected from the original eight, one toward each corner.

Symbolism [ edit ]

The flag's background is white, a traditional color in Korean culture. White was common in the daily attire of 19th-century Koreans, and it still appears in contemporary versions of traditional Korean garments, such as the hanbok. The color represents peace and purity.[2]

The circle in the middle is derived from the philosophy of um-yang (yin-yang from China) and represents balance in the universe. The red half represents positive cosmic forces, and the blue half represents the opposing negative cosmic forces.

Together, the trigrams represent movement and harmony as fundamental principles. Each trigram (hangeul: 괘 [gwae]; hanja: 卦) represents one of the four classical elements,[3] as described below:

DeepWatch Blocked Unblock Follow Following Jun 7, 2017

We at DeepWatch monitor illegal activities in the deep web. Our clients may from time to time examine the identified evidence themselves. This article helps them in the process.

So, you’ve heard of the “dark web” or “darknet”, a hidden internet infamous for hosting illegal activities. You may wonder what it actually looks like. Or your organization recently got hit by data breach and you want to look into it yourself.

You’ve probably also heard the dark web is a dangerous place, one that only an intelligence officer can get in and out of without losing a finger or two.

Is it true?

As it turns out, interacting with the dark web can be a relatively safe process even if you are not a security expert. To enter the dark web safely, we recommend this “super onion” setup as a reasonable approach to prevent bad guys from 1) Knowing who you are, 2) Attacking your computer, and 3) Stealing your data:

Why we call it a Super Onion? Because it’s composed of multiple layers with Tor Browser at its core.

Be daunted by this epic onion not. In this article, we will explain how to build it layer by layer. It’s easier than you might think.

Prerequisites: You are computer savvy. You understand no security solution is 100% safe. You aren’t going to do any illegal stuff — our method is not designed for escaping law enforcement.

Make sure to follow each and every step. Do not skip them or change their order. Your system could become vulnerable otherwise.

On Thursday, Marinij.com reported that San Domenico School in San Anselmo, California, had removed and relocated a number of Catholic statues in order to be more inclusive of other religions, sparking strong reactions from parents of students who attend the allegedly Catholic school.

Thus far, the school has removed and relocated all but 18 of their 180 Catholic icons and statues. The head of the school's board of trustees, Amy Skewes-Cox, claims such removals are “completely in compliance” with school rules, which were approved by the board and the Dominican Sisters of San Rafael last year.

Kim Pipki, whose daughter used to attend San Domenico, recalled the removal of the statue of baby Jesus and Mary as particularly contentious.

“The one main statue that has everyone fired up is the baby Jesus and Mary one,” said Pipki. “It was at the center of the primary school courtyard.”

“It was less about God and more about passing on some traditions,” the mother noted. “People were shocked that the statues were pitched in the basement.”

Shannon Fitzpatrick, whose eight-year-old daughter currently attends Domenico, wrote an email to school officials and the Dominican Sisters of San Rafael expressing her disapproval of the so-called inclusive changes, suggesting their version of "inclusion" apparently means gutting Catholicism from the school altogether.

“Articulating an inclusive foundation appears to mean letting go of San Domenico’s 167-year tradition as a Dominican Catholic school and being both afraid and ashamed to celebrate one’s heritage and beliefs,” wrote Fitzpatrick.

“In our time here, the word ‘Catholic’ has been removed from the mission statement, sacraments were removed from the curriculum, the lower school curriculum was changed to world religions, the logo and colors were changed to be ‘less Catholic,’ and the uniform was changed to be less Catholic," she continued.

The mother said she first became alarmed by the school's changes last year, when San Domenico removed “first reconciliation and first communion from the second-grade curriculum."

In a follow-up email, Fitzpatrick noted that she was not the only parent disturbed by the "inclusive" changes.

“There are other families having the same concerns I do. Many parents feel if the school is heading in a different direction then the San Domenico community should

Deep dive: What makes the Demon so wicked?

by Patrick Rall

At a small Detroit media event, SRT powertrain boss Chris Cowland laid out all of the fine details of the 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon.

The 2018 Challenger Demon had two simple guidelines during development – to run a 9-second quarter mile and to lift the front wheels off of the ground on launch, both in street legal trim.

Once the Demon was given the green light, Dodge added a few initial requirements, including an engine power increase of 10% over the Hellcat Hemi, and launch forces at least 20% greater than the standard Hellcat Challenger. At the same time, the Demon had to be emission-legal in all 50 states (meeting LEV160), meet pass-by noise requirements, and pass strict SRT durability testing.

The result is a 4,200 pound muscle car which will run a 9.65 quarter mile and lift the front wheels off of the ground on a hard launch with an 840 horsepower Hemi – which meets all emission and noise requirements set for by the industry and the company. Most importantly, the new Demon is 100% street-friendly, so in addition to being the quickest production car in the world, it can also serve as a comfortable daily driver.

This was achieved by introducing a new version 6.2-liter supercharged Hemi, with 62% of the content changed from the original Hellcat Hemi — including a new block, crankshaft, connecting rods, pistons, and supercharger assembly.

That 840 horsepower Hemi is mated to a new 8-speed automatic transmission which has been heavily upgraded with a new torque convertor and trans brake. From that stronger transmission, the power travels through a stronger driveshaft to a stronger rear differential with a steeper gear ratio and stronger axles – reaching the ground by means of the lightweight 18” wheels and the Demon-branded Nitto NT05R tires.

We knew all of that when the car was introduced back in April, but below, you will find a detailed rundown of how each key component of the drivetrain in the 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon differs from the Hellcat Hemi.

Richard Milhous Nixon (January 9, 1913 – April 22, 1994) was the 37th President of the United States, serving from 1969 to 1974. He was also the 36th Vice President, serving under Dwight D. Eisenhower. Nixon redefined the office of Vice President, making it for the first time a high visibility platform and base for a presidential candidacy. He is the only person to have been elected twice to the Vice Presidency and twice to the Presidency, and the only president to have resigned that office. His resignation came after advisement of imminent impeachment related to the Watergate break-in and subsequent Watergate scandal.

Nixon is noted for his diplomatic foreign policy, especially with the Soviet Union and China, and his efforts to end the Vietnam War. He is also noted for his middle-of-the-road domestic policy that combined conservative rhetoric and, in many cases, liberal action, as in his environmental policy.

As president, Nixon imposed wage and price controls, indexed Social Security for inflation, and created Supplemental Security Income. The number of pages added to the Federal Register each year doubled under Nixon. He advocated gun control, reduced speed limits, and eradicated the last remnants of the gold standard. Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency and Occupational Safety and Health Administration and implemented the Philadelphia Plan, the first significant federal affirmative action program.

In his later years, Nixon worked to rehabilitate his public image, and he enjoyed considerably more success than could have been anticipated at the time of his resignation. He gained great respect as an elder statesman in the area of foreign affairs, being consulted by both Democratic and Republican successors to the Presidency, and wrote several highly-regarded books.

Early years

Richard Nixon was born in Yorba Linda, California, to Francis A. Nixon and Hannah Milhous Nixon in a house his father built from a kit purchased from Sears, Roebuck. He was raised by his mother as an evangelical Quaker. His upbringing is said to have been marked by conservative evangelical Quaker observances, like refr
