Last week, scientists announced findings based on data from the SPICAM spectrometer onboard ESA’s Mars Express spacecraft. The findings reported in Science by Maltagliati et al (2011), reveal that the Martian atmosphere is supersaturated with water vapor. According to the research team, the discovery provides new information which will help scientists better understand the water cycle and atmospheric history of Mars.

What processes are at work to allow large amounts of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere?

The animated sequence to the left shows the water cycle of the Martian atmosphere in action:

When the polar caps of Mars (which contain frozen Water and CO 2 ) are warmed by the Sun during spring and summer, the water sublimates and is released into the atmosphere.

Atmospheric winds transport the water vapor molecules to higher altitudes. When the water molecules combine with dust molecules, clouds are formed. If there isn’t much dust in the atmosphere, the rate of condensation is reduced, which leaves water vapor in the atmosphere, creating a supersaturated state.

Water vapor may also be transported by wind to the southern hemisphere or may be carried high in the atmosphere.In the upper atmosphere the water vapor can be affected by photodissociation in which solar radiation (white arrows) splits the water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen atoms, which then escape into space.

Scientists had generally assumed that supersaturation cannot exist in the cold Martian atmosphere, believing that any water vapor in excess of saturation instantly froze. Data from SPICAM revealed that supersaturation takes place at altitudes of up to 50 km above the surface when Mars is at its farthest point from the Sun.

Based on the SPICAM data, scientists have learned that there is more water vapor in the Martian atmosphere than previously believed. While the amount of water in Mars’ atmosphere is about 10,000 times less water vapor than that of Earth, previous models have underestimated the amount of water in the Martian atmosphere at altitudes of 20-50km, as the data suggests 10 to 100 times more water than expected at said altitudes.

“The vertical distribution of water vapour is a key factor in the study of Mars’ hydrological cycle, and the old paradigm that it is mainly controlled by saturation physics now needs to be revised,” said Luca Maltagliati, one of the authors of the paper. “Our finding has major implications for understanding the planet’s global climate and the transport of water from one hemisphere to the other.”

Combining one of the strongest natural materials with one of the strongest artificial materials, researchers at the University of Trento in Italy created what they describe as "super silk".

"The protein matrix and hard tissues of insects, worms, ants and spiders naturally incorporates metals, such as zinc, manganese and copper," the study states. "This leads to mechanical hardening of teeth, jaws, mandibles, ovipositors and to an enhancement of silk toughness.

What is graphene? Graphene is a one-atom-thick material made of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice that is 200-times stronger than steel, more conductive than copper and as flexible as rubber. It has been touted as a "wonder material" by scientists for its remarkable properties and vast range of uses, which include everything from flexible smartphone screens to artificial retinas.

"Thus, the artificial incorporation of metals, or even insulating or semiconducting materials, into these protein structures could be exploited to obtain a reinforced matrix."

The silk created by the graphene-coated spiders is 3.5 times tougher than that of the giant riverine orb spider - the strongest silk known to nature.

The process that leads to the graphene and carbon nanotubes being infused in the silk is still not clear to the researchers, though the principle theory is that spiders make use of materials found within their immediate environments when spinning silk.

Nicola Pugno, the lead researcher in the study, believes that the strength of the material produced is the highest reported to date, even when compared to high performance fibres like kevlar or the current toughest knotted fibres.

The researchers hope that similar techniques in the future can be used to create a new class of bionic materials and have suggested that one potential application could be to create a giant net capable of catching falling aircraft.

"This approach could be extended to other animals and plants and could lead to a new class of bionic materials for ultimate applications," Pugno said.

"This concept could become a way to obtain materials with superior characteristics."<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Our world is made of elements and combinations of elements called compounds. An element is a pure substance made of atoms that are all of the same type. At present, 116 elements are known, and only about 90 of these occur naturally.

Elements and the ‘Big Bang’ theory

During the formation of the universe some 14 billion years ago in the so-called ‘Big Bang’, only the lightest elements were formed – hydrogen and helium along with trace amounts of lithium and beryllium. As the cloud of cosmic dust and gases from the Big Bang cooled, stars formed, and these then grouped together to form galaxies.

The other 86 elements found in nature were created in nuclear reactions in these stars and in huge stellar explosions known as supernovae.

Elements and our Sun

For most of their lives, stars fuse elemental hydrogen into helium in their cores. Two atoms of hydrogen are combined in a series of steps to create helium-4. These reactions account for 85% of the Sun’s energy. The remaining 15% comes from reactions that produce the elements beryllium and lithium.

The energy from these nuclear reactions is emitted in various forms of radiation such as ultraviolet light, X-rays, visible light, infrared rays, microwaves and radio waves. In addition, energised particles such as neutrinos and protons are released, and it is these that make up the solar wind.

Earth is in the path of this energy stream, which warms the planet, drives weather and provides energy for life. The Earth’s atmosphere is able to screen out most of the harmful radiation, and the Earth’s magnetic field can deflect the harmful effects of the solar wind.

Dying stars

When a star’s core runs out of hydrogen, the star begins to die out. The dying star expands into a red giant, and this now begins to manufacture carbon atoms by fusing helium atoms.

More massive stars begin a further series of nuclear burning or reaction stages. The elements formed in these stages range from oxygen through to iron.

During a supernova, the star releases very large amounts of energy as well as neutrons, which allows elements heavier than iron, such as uranium and gold, to be produced. In the supernova explosion, all of these elements are expelled out into space.

Our world is literally made up of elements formed deep within the cores of stars now long dead. As Britain’s Astronomer Royal Sir Martin Rees said, “We are literally the ashes of long dead stars.” When you buy a

What's in a name? For the Greek god of the sun, Helios.

Say what? Helium is pronounced as HEE-lee-em.

History and Uses:

Helium, the second most abundant element in the universe, was discovered on the sun before it was found on the earth. Pierre-Jules-César Janssen, a French astronomer, noticed a yellow line in the sun's spectrum while studying a total solar eclipse in 1868. Sir Norman Lockyer, an English astronomer, realized that this line, with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometers, could not be produced by any element known at the time. It was hypothesized that a new element on the sun was responsible for this mysterious yellow emission. This unknown element was named helium by Lockyer.

The hunt to find helium on earth ended in 1895. Sir William Ramsay, a Scottish chemist, conducted an experiment with a mineral containing uranium called clevite. He exposed the clevite to mineral acids and collected the gases that were produced. He then sent a sample of these gases to two scientists, Lockyer and Sir William Crookes, who were able to identify the helium within it. Two Swedish chemists, Nils Langlet and Per Theodor Cleve, independently found helium in clevite at about the same time as Ramsay.

Helium makes up about 0.0005% of the earth's atmosphere. This trace amount of helium is not gravitationally bound to the earth and is constantly lost to space. The earth's atmospheric helium is replaced by the decay of radioactive elements in the earth's crust. Alpha decay, one type of radioactive decay, produces particles called alpha particles. An alpha particle can become a helium atom once it captures two electrons from its surroundings. This newly formed helium can eventually work its way to the atmosphere through cracks in the crust.

Helium is commercially recovered from natural

<|begin_of_text|>Today’s post looks at an aspect of chemistry we come across every day: alloys. Alloys make up parts of buildings, transport, coins, and plenty of other objects in our daily lives. But what are the different alloys we use made up of, and why do we use them instead of elemental metals? The graphic answers the first of these questions, and in the post we’ll try and answer the second.

First, a little on what alloys are, for anyone unfamiliar with the term. Alloys are a mixture of elements, where at least one of the elements is a metal. There are over 80 metals in the periodic table of elements, and we can mix selections of these different metals in varying proportions, sometimes with non-metals too, to create alloys. Note the use of the word mixture: in the vast majority of cases, alloys are simply intermixed elements, rather than elements that are chemically bonded together.

Alloys can be simply classified in terms of their atomic arrangements. In cases where the two elements being mixed to make the alloy have similar atom sizes, atoms of the second element can simply take the place of atoms of the first element in the structure. These types of alloys are called substitution alloys. On the other hand, if the atoms of the second element are much smaller, they can slot into the gaps between atoms of the first element. These alloys are known as interstitial alloys. Alloys can be made in a number of ways, but they are primarily fashioned by mixing together the molten components.

There are a great range of alloys; the main graphic illustrates just a small selection of those that we use in a range of applications. But why use them in the first place when there are so many different metals with varying properties in the periodic table? Whilst metallic elements may have desirable properties, unfortunately they rarely have them in convenient combinations. Gold is shiny and, well, golden, but it’s also quite soft, meaning if you try and make a ring from pure gold, it’ll deform easily. Iron is present in many buildings, but on its own it too is a little on the soft side, and also has a tendency to rust when exposed to damp air.

Making alloys is essentially a way for us to ‘tweak’ the properties of a metal, to make them closer to the ideal properties we want for a particular purpose. Alloying gold with copper or silver makes it harder, whilst alloying iron with carbon and a selection of other metals accomplishes a similar effect, and also helps prevent it

<|begin_of_text|>As semiconductor nanowires emerge as indispensable building blocks for next-generation electronic, energy conversion, and photonic devices (i.e. solar panels, lasers), better understanding how to direct nanowire growth is vital, according to Georgia Tech researchers.

Many orders of magnitude smaller than household wires, nanowires can be made from a variety of semiconducting materials including germanium and silicon.

For years, the synthesis of nanowires has been somewhat mysterious, requiring scientists to experiment with reactor settings, modulating temperature and pressure, to see what would work best – a slow, arduous process of trial and error. “It’s been like cooking something in the oven without ever being able to look in until it’s done hours later,” explains Michael Filler, associate professor at Georgia Tech’s School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering.

However, a team working in the Filler Laboratory has gained unprecedented insight into the nanowire growth process through the use of real-time infrared spectroscopy. They found that surface species, specifically hydrogen atoms and methyl groups, decorate the nanowire’s surface and are essential for the stable growth of nanowires made from germanium.

According to the study’s findings, without the presence of hydrogen and methyl adsorbing (or adhering) to the nanowire sidewalls, the liquid droplet that sits atop the nanowire could slip, causing growth to cease. “These surface species, hydrogen and methyl molecules, act like a layer of Rain-X, keeping the droplet in place,” Filler explains.

“Our work shows that without these surface adsorbates, growth doesn’t happen. No one knew that before,” says Filler, whose research team published its findings in a recent issue of the Journal of the American Chemical Society. “For as long as scientists have been using this growth method – more than five decades – we didn’t know that anything was present on the wire surface.”

Now that the scientific community is aware of this key aspect of nanowire synthesis, researchers will be able to better design processes and precursors to choreograph nanowire growth, Filler says. As obstacles to the production of nanowires are overcome, they can be manufactured on a greater sale and incorporated into commercial products.

“The fundamental chemical knowledge provided in our study promises to advance the rational synthetic design of nanowire structure and function,” Filler says.

Titled “Direct Observation of Transient Surface Species during Ge Nanowire Growth and Their Influence on Growth Stability,” the study was led by

Oxygen toxicity Synonyms Oxygen toxicity syndrome, oxygen intoxication, oxygen poisoning In 1942–43 the UK Government carried out extensive testing for oxygen toxicity in divers. The chamber is pressurised with air to 3.7 bar. The subject in the centre is breathing 100% oxygen from a mask. Specialty Emergency medicine

Oxygen toxicity is a condition resulting from the harmful effects of breathing molecular oxygen (O

2 ) at increased partial pressures. Severe cases can result in cell damage and death, with effects most often seen in the central nervous system, lungs, and eyes. Historically, the central nervous system condition was called the Paul Bert effect, and the pulmonary condition the Lorrain Smith effect, after the researchers who pioneered the discoveries and descriptions in the late 19th century. Oxygen toxicity is a concern for underwater divers, those on high concentrations of supplemental oxygen (particularly premature babies), and those undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

The result of breathing increased partial pressures of oxygen is hyperoxia, an excess of oxygen in body tissues. The body is affected in different ways depending on the type of exposure. Central nervous system toxicity is caused by short exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure. Pulmonary and ocular toxicity result from longer exposure to increased oxygen levels at normal pressure. Symptoms may include disorientation, breathing problems, and vision changes such as myopia. Prolonged exposure to above-normal oxygen partial pressures, or shorter exposures to very high partial pressures, can cause oxidative damage to cell membranes, collapse of the alveoli in the lungs, retinal detachment, and seizures. Oxygen toxicity is managed by reducing the exposure to increased oxygen levels. Studies show that, in the long term, a robust recovery from most types of oxygen toxicity is possible.

Protocols for avoidance of the effects of hyperoxia exist in fields where oxygen is breathed at higher-than-normal partial pressures, including underwater diving using compressed breathing gases, hyperbaric medicine, neonatal care and human spaceflight. These protocols have resulted in the increasing rarity of seizures due to oxygen toxicity, with pulmonary and ocular damage being mainly confined to the problems of managing premature infants.

In recent years, oxygen has become available for recreational use in oxygen bars. The US Food and Drug Administration has warned those suffering from problems such as heart or lung disease not to use oxygen bars.

After a long time gone I’m slowly getting back into business but with a lot of energy 🙂

Introduction

These past weeks I’ve been solving a couple of coding challenges and for one of them I thought (and I still think) that the best solution would be achieved by using a Graph Db (can’t post details because of confidential reasons). I had a little bit of experience using Neo4j in the past, not an expert though. So I did a bit of research and I found Titan Db which caught my attention as they claim it is a scalable Distributed Graph Database supporting thousand of concurrent users executing complex graph traversals in real time, just what I needed.

So this post will be about creating a small social network twitter-alike (following / followed by) using Titan Db. For those impatient creatures, here’s the code.

Basic Example

In this basic example we have the following relationships:

Gabi is following Damian and John, and is followed by Damian and Mike.

Damian is following Gabi and John, and is followed by Gabi.

John is following Chris, and is followed by Gabi and Damian.

Mike is following Gabi.

Chris is followed by John.

Pretty basic but enough to demonstrate how we can start creating these relationships in Titan Db using the Gremlin Scala DSL.

Introduction to Graph Databases

NOTE: If you’re already familiar with this concept feel free to skip this part.

As described in the Apache TinkerPop website: “A graph is a structure composed of vertices and edges. Both vertices and edges can have an arbitrary number of key/value-pairs called properties. Vertices denote discrete objects such as a person, a place, or an event. Edges denote relationships between vertices. For instance, a person may know another person, have been involved in an event, and/or was recently at a particular place. Properties express non-relational information about the vertices and edges. Example properties include a vertex having a name, an age and an edge having a timestamp and/or a weight. Together, the aforementioned graph is known as a property graph and it is the foundational data structure of Apache TinkerPop”.

So for our example every person will be a Vertex and both relationships “following” and “followedBy” will be Edges. Every person has an Id and a Name which will be Properties of each Vertice.

<|begin_of_text|>The brain - awake and sleeping - is awash in electrical activity, and not just from the individual pings of single neurons communicating with each other. In fact, the brain is enveloped in countless overlapping electric fields, generated by the neural circuits of scores of communicating neurons. The fields were once thought to be an "epiphenomenon, a 'bug' of sorts, occurring during neural communication," says neuroscientist Costas Anastassiou, a postdoctoral scholar in biology at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).

New work by Anastassiou and his colleagues, however, suggests that the fields do much more - and that they may, in fact, represent an additional form of neural communication.

"In other words," says Anastassiou, the lead author of a paper about the work appearing in the journal Nature Neuroscience, "while active neurons give rise to extracellular fields, the same fields feed back to the neurons and alter their behavior," even though the neurons are not physically connected - a phenomenon known as ephaptic coupling. "So far, neural communication has been thought to occur at localized machines, termed synapses. Our work suggests an additional means of neural communication through the extracellular space independent of synapses."

Extracellular electric fields exist throughout the living brain, though they are particularly strong and robustly repetitive in specific brain regions such as the hippocampus, which is involved in memory formation, and the neocortex, the area where long-term memories are held. "The perpetual fluctuations of these extracellular fields are the hallmark of the living and behaving brain in all organisms, and their absence is a strong indicator of a deeply comatose, or even dead, brain," Anastassiou explains.

Previously, neurobiologists assumed that the fields were capable of affecting - and even controlling - neural activity only during severe pathological conditions such as epileptic seizures, which induce very strong fields. Few studies, however, had actually assessed the impact of far weaker - but very common - non-epileptic fields. "The reason is simple," Anastassiou says. "It is very hard to conduct an in vivo experiment in the absence of extracellular fields," to observe what changes when the fields are not around.

To tease out those effects, Anastassiou and his colleagues, including Caltech neuroscientist Christof Koch, the Lois and Victor Troendle Professor of Cognitive and Behavioral Biology and professor of computation and neural systems, focused on strong but slowly oscillating fields, called local field potentials (L

<|begin_of_text|>As we know from our history books, the War for Independence began with the shots fired at Lexington and Concord. Those shots required gunpowder, a substance that was in short supply throughout the colonies. In 1775 there was only one American gunpowder mill, the Frankford Mill in Pennsylvania, and it was turning out a miniscule amount compared to what would be needed to wage a successful war.[1] In addition, this mill was not turning out the high-quality powder needed for artillery use. If the Patriots were going to have any chance of victory, the colonies needed to step up production or import it. Had it not been for the French assistance in supplying the Americans with gunpowder from 1776 throughout the war, American forces would not have been able to fight and win the battles that they did.

Gunpowder is a mixture of sulfur, charcoal, and potassium nitrate that must be combined in specific ratios. While this sounds simple enough, it must be remembered that in 1775 the state of chemistry was rudimentary. Potassium nitrate itself is a compound of nitrogen and potassium, neither element of which had been identified at that point in time.[2] What they did know was that what they called “nitre” was needed, which, in some recipes, involved soaking soil in urine from both animals and humans, and then allowing it to dry. The dried urine-soil was then boiled to produce saltpeter. Not all recipes agreed with this method which added to the problems in making gunpowder. Unfortunately this required half a year or more to produce nitre-bearing soil and created a bottleneck in the production of gunpowder in America.

When the War for Independence started American supplies of powder were what they had gathered from Royal sources or their own local supplies. The amount was not enough to sustain an army in the field. While Congress was hopeful that they could establish enough mills to create their own self-sustaining sources of gunpowder, they also decided to seek additional supplies from overseas which meant European suppliers. The Journals of the Continental Congress are full of references to purchasing gunpowder in the West Indies. To do so meant selling American goods which involved adjusting the rules under the Association agreement of 1774. As several congressional delegates noted, gunpowder was needed or else the whole enterprise was lost. A Secret Committee was set up on September 19, 1775 to contract and agree to importation of gunpowder not to exceed 500 tons.[3]

<|begin_of_text|>Cryptography’s most familiar application is perhaps the sending of coded messages: Alice wants to communicate some information to her distant confidante Bob. She worries that her message might be intercepted by an eavesdropper, so she encrypts it in a way that only Bob can decipher. But there exists a whole range of complementary cryptographic tasks—such as online auctions and secure voting—in which Alice and Bob want to guard against attacks not from eavesdroppers but from each other.

To develop algorithms to perform those other tasks, cryptographers use a building block called bit commitment: Alice chooses a bit (a 1 or 0) to be revealed later; Bob wants to ensure that Alice can’t change her mind in the meantime, while Alice wants to ensure that Bob has no way to learn which bit she chose until the appointed time.

Although quantum theory is the basis for perfectly secure encryption, it offers no path to secure bit commitment. But a different law of physics, the impossibility of faster-than-light signaling, has now come to the rescue, and Anthony Martin, Hugo Zbinden, and their colleagues at the University of Geneva have implemented a protocol for achieving bit commitment for a full 24 hours.

For the protocol to work, Alice and Bob work with trusted partners Amy and Brian, respectively. Bob and Brian take turns exchanging data with Alice and Amy, in such a way that each exchange falls outside the forward light cone of the previous one. Each of Alice’s and Amy’s answers depends on both the data they receive from Bob or Brian and on information Alice and Amy agree on in advance, including the bit they want to commit. For Alice to cheat and change the bit at any time in the middle of the protocol, she’d need to know what happened in Amy’s most recent exchange with Brian; relativity prevents her from having that information.

In their 24-hour implementation, Martin and colleagues repeated the exchanges for 5 billion rounds, one every 17 µs, with a total of 162 GB of data. According to two theory papers from the past year, the probability that the protocol is vulnerable to cheating is less than one in a billion. (E. Verbanis et al., Phys. Rev.

<|begin_of_text|>Sand is composed of particles of minerals, rock, or soil, with quartz being the most common constituent. Peaks that once stood rock solid have eroded into sand. How does such erosion occur?

Sand is often the product of ocean violence. Waves smash against coastal cliffs, and these collisions loosen and rip away slabs of rock. Very large pieces surrender before the unremitting assault, being sloughed off in chunks into the surf. The churning sea grinds off sharp edges, producing boulders. Constant motion gradually wears them into pebbles, and these are crushed into still smaller particles, which we know as sand. Sometimes the sea carries the sand off, but in many places, waves heave the sand back ashore, leaving pristine beaches.

When cold weather combines with ocean violence, frozen water becomes trapped in rock, producing icy wedges that split the stones. The fracturing goes on, reducing large rock masses to smaller and smaller pieces, which eventually become sand.

The wind too plays a role, lifting grains of sand and driving them against rock masses. The abrasion creates more sand. Layers of rock hundreds of feet thick give way before this natural form of sandblasting. Meanwhile, the wind scatters the resulting sand, stretching it out like a carpet on the desert floor.

Over millenniums, these harsh processes have yielded countless tons of sand. Many people would be delighted if it were used only to provide contoured cushions at the beach. But sand’s value reaches far beyond the shore, as we shall see.

Tiny Grains, Huge Benefits

To a large degree, our eating and drinking is dependent on sand. How is that? In one way or another, all our food comes from the vegetation of the earth. Sand and its finely ground cousins silt and clay supply minerals that plants need. Also, sand in the soil allows air and water to circulate. Thus, plant roots can easily absorb nutrients. But how is sand involved in quenching our thirst?

If you fill a one-quart [one-liter] jar with dry sand, you can add a third of a quart [300 milliliters] of water to that same jar without making it overflow. This is so because sand is porous —that is, between its grains there is a lot of space. In fact, there are sand “water jars” large enough to supply large cities with the life-giving fluid. What are they?

(NaturalNews) Coca-Cola and Pepsico have both announced they are removing brominated vegetable oil (BVO) from their beverage products following a sustained social media campaign that protested the practice. Brominated vegetable oil is a flame retardant, and it's usually made from genetically modified corn or soy derivatives bonded with a bromine atom., just like fluoride and chlorine (they're all in the same column on the Table of Elements).

The hydrogen atom is unique since physical theories can be applied to it “without” approximations. Any discrepancy between theoretical prediction and experimental measurement which may be unveiled at any increase of theoretical and experimental accuracy thus holds the potential for new fundamental insights.

Nothing can hide in hydrogen, not even the proton at its center. In fact, measurements with hydrogen beams by Stern in 1933 revealed that the magnetic moment of the proton deviated from the prediction of the Dirac relativistic theory. This was the first indication that the proton - contrary to the electron - has a structure. In 1947 measurements of the 2S-2P (Lamb shift) and 1S-hyperfine splitting in hydrogen deviated from those predicted by the Dirac equation. This was the initiation for the development of quantum electrodynamics (QED). In the last four decades, the goal to measure hydrogen energy levels with greater accuracy has lead to advances in high resolution spectroscopy and metrology. This peaked with the invention of the frequency comb laser by Hänsch in the late 90ies. The high accuracy obtained with such techniques provided cornerstones to test bound-state QED, to determine the Rydberg constant and the proton radius (assuming the correctness of the theory), and to search for slow time variations of fundamental constants.

Hydrogen energy levels are slightly modified by the fact that in contrast to the electron the proton has a size. Hence, to precisely predict these energy levels an accurate knowledge of the root-mean-square charge radius of the proton is necessary. The historical method of determining the proton radius was based upon scattering electrons on protons, in effect by scattering an electron beam on a liquid hydrogen target. The uncertainty related to the knowledge of the proton radius extracted from electron-proton scattering limited the prediction accuracy of the hydrogen energy levels, and consequently it was limiting the comparison between theory and measurements. Therefore to advance the check (comparison between prediction and measurement) of bound-state QED describing the hydrogen energy levels it was necessary to have a more precise determination of the proton radius. This was one of the main motivations for our experiment: to measure the 2S-2P energy difference in muonic hydrogen (µp), an exotic atom composed by a negative muon and a proton. The single electron of a hydrogen atom is replaced by a negative muon which has a lifetime of only 2 microseconds and is 200 times heavier than the electron. According to the laws of quantum mechanics the muon wave functions in S-states overlap

He records a personal greeting for two schoolgirls embarking on their first play. And another one. And another one.

If I hadn’t known before that the star of Sherlock and Star Trek: Into Darkness was the most popular man in Britain, I’d know it now.

He finally bids his fan club farewell: “Not at all,” he tells them. “One of the perks of the job.”

He bounds over and reaches for a giant dark chocolate Toblerone. “I am sorry,” he tells me with a firm handshake. “But I do need sugar.” He politely pushes the big triangle into the side of his mouth so that he can keep talking. The effect is to sharpen his already razor-like cheekbones. “I wish there was a more decorous way of doing this,” he smiles.

I can’t think of one. This is exactly how I would expect a Mitford sister to eat polyhedral- shaped confectionary if they had lately been accosted by Cumberbitches. But the 38-year-old can’t find cause to complain.

“You have to pinch yourself,” he says cheerfully. “To have a professional life where you get to tell stories and people respond? It’s kind of wonderful. Magic, actually.”

Not that Cumberbatch is impressed by celebrity. Even his own. BBC’s Sherlock has catapulted him to the top of Sexiest Man Alive and Britain’s Greatest Thespian polls. But such things are of little consequence to Benedict Timothy Carlton Cumberbatch.

Water accounts for nearly 57 percent of an adult male's body weight. Nearly 70 percent of our planet's surface is covered in water. Unimaginable numbers of water molecules travel the earth via the ebbs and flows of tides, the acceleration of eddies and whirlpools and the dynamic surges of currents and floods, torrents and tsunamis.

Some 1200 years after it disappeared beneath the surface of the Mediterranean Sea, the ancient Egyptian city of Heracleion was recently discovered by archaeologist Frank Goddo and a team from the European Institute of Underwater Archaeology.

Meanwhile, as islands in the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean start to disappear and scientists use computer modeling to imagine the impact of rising sea levels on coastal cities, a picture is still worth a thousand words.

Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy showed the devastation that can be wrought by a storm surge. This footage of the tsunami that followed the March 2011 Tohoku earthquake off the northeastern coast of Japan offers stunning visuals of the power unleashed by vast volumes of water gathering momentum.

While the fish it contains can provide seemingly endless amounts of nutrition -- and a sailing vessel caught in a doldrum can remain becalmed for days on end -- a tsunami like the one that struck the Indian Ocean in 2004 can kill nearly a quarter of a million people.

Its structure consists of chains of boron atoms (blue) connected into a slab by iron atoms (red) separated by layers of aluminum atoms (grey). Credit: J. Am. Chem. Soc.

Refrigerators in our kitchens cool food by powering pumps that compress gases like Freon. Some scientists and engineers would like to scrap those energy inefficient compressors and chill refrigerators using low energy magnets. These researchers are on the hunt for practical materials that exhibit the magnetocaloric effect—the ability of a substance to heat and cool under the influence of a magnetic field. Now a team at Florida State University has shown that inexpensive transition-metal borides exhibit the magnetocaloric effect at low magnetic fields (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013, DOI: 10.1021/ja404107p).

A material that exhibits a magnetocaloric effect will heat up in an applied magnetic field and then cool when the field is removed. Basically, the material releases energy when a magnetic field forces its magnetic poles to align and then absorbs energy when the field is gone and the poles randomize.

In 1997, Karl A. Gschneidner Jr. and colleagues at the Ames National Laboratory demonstrated the first material with a strong magnetocaloric effect at near room temperature. Unfortunately, this alloy of gadolinium, silicon, and germanium (Gd 5 Si 2 Ge 2 ) requires strong magnetic fields applied by an electromagnet to cool down significantly. It also contains expensive rare-earth elements.

Since that discovery, materials scientists have been hunting for magnetocaloric materials that work under the relatively weak magnetic fields produced by strong permanent magnets. Without the need to power an electromagnet, a magnetic refrigerator would require little energy to operate.

During that hunt for new materials, no one had looked at borides, says Michael Shatruk, a chemist at Florida State University. Shatruk notes that the strongest permanent magnets are made from neodymium iron boron. He thought that taking out the neodymium might give the material magnetocaloric properties. Indeed, he and his colleagues found that iron boron and manganese boron exhibit the magnetocaloric effect—but at about 300 °C. Computer modeling suggested that adding aluminum ions would bring down the temperature to more practical levels.

To test their prediction, Shatruk’s group synthesized the aluminum iron bor

AC power plugs and sockets allow electric equipment to be connected to the alternating current (AC) power supply in buildings and at other sites. Electrical plugs and sockets differ from one another in voltage and current rating, shape, size, and connector type. Different standard systems of plugs and sockets are used around the world.

Plugs and sockets for portable appliances became available in the 1880s, to replace connections to light sockets with wall-mounted outlets. A proliferation of types developed for both convenience and protection from electrical injury. Today there are about 20 types in common use around the world, and many obsolete socket types are found in older buildings. Coordination of technical standards has allowed some types of plug to be used across large regions to facilitate trade in electrical appliances, and for the convenience of travellers and consumers of imported electrical goods.

Some multi-standard sockets allow use of several types of plug; improvised or unapproved adaptors between incompatible sockets and plugs may not provide the full safety and performance of an approved socket–plug combination.

Concepts and terminology [ edit ]

Plugs and sockets may sometimes combine male and female contacts. Clockwise from top left: CEE 7/4 (German) plug; a matching CEE 7/3 socket with exposed earth (ground) projections on circumference of socket; CEE 7/5 (French) socket with projecting earth pin. Typically no energy is supplied to any exposed pins or terminals on the socket, for safety.

A plug is the movable connector attached to an electrically operated device, and the socket is fixed on equipment or a building structure and connected to an energised electrical circuit. The plug is a male connector with protruding pins that match the openings and female contacts in a socket. Some plugs have female contacts that are used only for an earth ground connection. Some plugs have built-in fuses for safety.

To reduce the risk of electric shock, plug and socket systems have safety features in addition to the recessed contacts of the energised socket. These may include plugs with insulated sleeves, recessed sockets, or automatic shutters to block socket apertures when a plug is removed.

A socket may be surrounded by a decorative or protective cover [1] which may be integral with the socket.

Single-phase sockets have two current-carrying connections to the power supply circuit, and may also have a third pin for a safety connection to

New York’s streetlights currently produce a baleful orange glow by electrocuting vaporized sodium atoms. Sodium bulbs have been around since the 1930s and are commonly used in cities. But LEDs last longer (20 years) than sodium bulbs (6 years), tend to be more efficient, and give off cleaner, more illuminating light.

New York has already gone to LEDs on select streets in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and in Central Park. The $76.5 million project will replace streetlights in waves of 80,000 and, and if projections bear out, save $14 million in maintenance and energy annually.

New York’s transportation commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan, said in a press conference, “These 250,000 new lights will redefine our roadways and neighborhoods, bringing in clearer, whiter and more attractive lights to our 6,000 miles of streets and 12,000 miles of sidewalks.”

Bloomberg and company say New York City’s LED project is the world’s biggest—but it’s hardly the first.

Los Angeles, for example, recently finished replacing just over 141,000 streetlights with LEDs. The city says savings have so far outstripped projections (63% cost reduction compared to the forecast 40%), and light pollution is much reduced because LEDs can be better directed, preventing unintended light leakage.

Other US cities upgrading to LED streetlights include Seattle, Las Vegas, Austin, and San Antonio, among others. Buenos Aires will soon install some 100,000 LED streetlights. More may follow. According to Navigant Research, shipments of LED streetlights are set to rise from 3 million in 2012 to 17 million in 2020.

Beyond energy and maintenance savings, LEDs can also make city lighting smarter. Senior Navigant research analyst, Eric Woods, said, “LED lamps allow for better dimming control than standard street lights, and their electronics allow for easy integration of control nodes.”

Woods thinks finance may be the biggest hindrance to wider adoption. Upfront costs of projects can stymy cash-strapped municipalities.

Accelerating adoption of LED lighting in cities is mirrored at home. Though LEDs currently make up less than 10% of the residential market, they

Wikipedia was founded in 2001 as a project to build an online, free-access, free-content encyclopedia entirely from scratch. Since then, it has grown to be the largest encyclopedia ever created, comprising more than five million articles in English, while still relying on the contributions of volunteers. The English Wikipedia community thanks the millions of users whose edits over the past fourteen-plus years have made this remarkable accomplishment possible.

A brief history

Wikipedia officially launched on 15 January 2001, with Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger as its leaders, on a single computer server as the successor to Nupedia. Its first major mainstream media coverage was in The New York Times on 20 September 2001. In the first year of its existence, more than 20,000 encyclopedia entries were created – a rate exceeding 1,500 articles per month. Today, there are Wikipedia editions in more than 200 languages, accompanied by a dozen additional free-content projects, such as Wikimedia Commons. In March 2006, the English Wikipedia reached one million articles. According to Alexa, Wikipedia is currently the world's sixth most popular website, receiving approximately eight billion pageviews per month. We reached five million articles on 1 November 2015.

A work in progress

While Wikipedia is an incredible success, it remains a work in progress. There are still great gaps in its coverage with millions of important topics missing from its pages. Many articles – even vital ones – are not yet considered high-quality. Of our 5,810,435 articles, only a few tens of thousands have passed a vetting process for good or featured status, and more than half are short stubs or start-class articles. There are also more than 200 non-English-language editions of Wikipedia that need volunteers. In other words, there is still much work to be done – and you can help!

LAKE WALES, Fla. -- Researchers at the Department of Energy's (DoE's) Brookhaven National Laboratory have claimed a world record, saying they have patterned devices with feature sizes as small as 1nm. The research team hopes to use the same technique to create and impart to silicon new properties never before observed.

So far, the Brookhaven researchers have only proven the concept with poly-methyl methacrylate or PMMA -- a polymer commonly used as a coating in lithography as an alternative to glass (under the Plexiglas trade name) and a resist called hydrogen silsesquioxane. A schematic showing a focused electron beam (green) shining through a polymeric film (grey: carbon atoms; red: oxygen atoms; white: hydrogen atoms) with yellow indicating scope of electron beam.

Brookhaven scientists made clever use of an electron microscope to pattern the material at even smaller sizes than is normally possible with electron-beam lithography (EBL). The electron-sensitive materials were exposed to a focused beam of electrons, as usual, but with its features reduced to a size capable of manipulating individual atoms. The result is a new tool capable of dramatically altering a material's properties, from electrical conductivity to light transmission and interactions between the two.

The feat was accomplished by the Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN), a DoE Office of Science User Facility at Brookhaven (Long Island, N.Y.). The 1nm features patterned using the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) were spaced 11 nanometers apart, which could allow nearly one trillion features to be patterned within a single square centimeter. They also achieved 2nm resolution with the aberration-corrected STEM with a 5nm half-pitch in hydrogen silsesquioxane resist.

The resolution limits of aberration-corrected electron-beam lithography -- usually 10 nanometers at best -- were improved by installing a slow-moving pattern generator that followed the instructions from a specialized computer program. The automated STEM provided a focused electron beam at the atomic scale enabling individual atoms to be assembled into patterns, including gold palladium features as small as

The answer is the atomic clock, which Swiss scientists are developing at CSEM (Centre Suisse d’électronique et microtechnique) in the Swiss city of Neuchatel.

The atomic clock measures time accurately, because it relies on the radiation emitted by atoms. It means that the frequency emitted by atoms of hydrogen are measured, and that gives the reference for the time. The original version of the atomic clock, built in the 90s, was the size of a household washing machine.

But CSEM scientists working in Neuchatel’s old astronomical observatory are moving steadily towards the progressive miniaturisation of the atomic clock. Their goal is to reduce it to the size of a sugar cube.

Miniaturisation will greatly reduce manufacturing costs and power consumption allowing this technology to be used more widely, possibly it could even enter the consumer market in battery-operated devices, like GPS or smart phones.

According to physicist Steve Lecomte, what is known as the heart of the clock is key. It has to be reduced in size to nearly a millimetre: “Minitiarisation is useful in order to put atomic clocks in more instruments and mobile devices. Our ultimate goal here at CSEM is work towards having an atomic timepiece in a wrist-watch.”

Scientists not only hope to install atomic clocks in consumer electronic devices, but they want to use them for scientific purposes, such as verifying Einstein’s theory of relativity.

“If we were to put an atomic clock in a smartphone with a GPS for example, then we’d have a frequency base in the GPS which would allow a faster sychronisation with geo-positioning satellites and therefore a more efficient device,” explained CSEM physicist Jacques Haesler.

“Right now, if you have in a wrist-watch, you have to wind it up from time to time. Maybe every day or every few weeks. With an atomic clock inside, in theory you’ll only need to set it once every 3,000 years, providing of course your battery lasts that long,” he added.

Today the best atomic clocks are able to keep time to the point where they will gain or lose a second, every one billion years, and they are powered by an extremely tiny engine. This miniscule part, only a millimetre across, holds the key to a future in which

Monoclonal antibody therapy is a form of immunotherapy that uses monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to bind monospecifically to certain cells or proteins. The objective is that this treatment will stimulate the patient's immune system to attack those cells. Alternatively, in radioimmunotherapy a radioactive dose localizes a target cell line, delivering lethal chemical doses.[1] More recently antibodies have been used to bind to molecules involved in T-cell regulation to remove inhibitory pathways that block T-cell responses. This is known as immune checkpoint therapy.[2]

It is possible to create a mAb that is specific to almost any extracellular/cell surface target. Research and development is underway to create antibodies for diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Ebola[3] and different types of cancers).

Antibody structure and function [ edit ]

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies are large heterodimeric molecules, approximately 150 kDa and are composed of two kinds of polypeptide chain, called the heavy (~50kDa) and the light chain (~25kDa). The two types of light chains are kappa (κ) and lambda (λ). By cleavage with enzyme papain, the Fab (fragment-antigen binding) part can be separated from the Fc (fragment constant) part of the molecule. The Fab fragments contain the variable domains, which consist of three antibody hypervariable amino acid domains responsible for the antibody specificity embedded into constant regions. The four known IgG subclasses are involved in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.[4] Antibodies are a key component of the adaptive immune response, playing a central role in both in the recognition of foreign antigens and the stimulation of an immune response to them. The advent of monoclonal antibody technology has made it possible to raise antibodies against specific antigens presented on the surfaces of tumors.[5] Monoclonal antibodies can be acquired in the immune system via passive immunity or active immunity.The advantage of active monoclonal antibody therapy is the fact that the immune system will produce antibodies long-term, with only a short-term drug administration to induce this response. However, the immune response to certain antigens may be inadequate, especially in the elderly. Additionally, adverse reactions from these antibodies may occur because of long-lasting response to antigens.[6] Passive monoclonal antibody therapy can ensure consistent antibody concentration, and can control for adverse reactions by stopping administration.

Scientists demonstrated such a material. They combined two oxides on the atomic scale. The interface between the oxide materials, one containing strontium and titanium and one containing lanthanum and chromium, absorbs visible light, producing electrons and holes that might be useful for catalyzing reactions, such as producing hydrogen fuel. However, if there is nothing to pull those electrons and holes apart, they will quickly annihilate one another without doing anything useful. By carefully synthesizing this material as a series of alternating layers, the international team created a built-in electric field that could help separate the excited electrons and holes and improve the material's performance as a catalyst.

This material opens up new scientific frontiers to solve a persistent energy challenge: storing solar energy for later use. Fuel cells capable of running on hydrogen fuel created by solar energy could allow people to heat their homes and run their computers on solar energy even in the dark of night.

By depositing thin layers of SrTiO 3 and LaCrO 3 on a crystalline substrate, the investigators at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, SuperSTEM, and the University of Oxford controlled how the ions at the interfaces bond to each other. This allowed them to engineer an electric field in the material that can be used to separate electrons and holes. Using X-ray spectroscopy techniques, they confirmed that the electric field was present and that the ions in the material shift positions as a result. Ultra-high resolution measurements using an electron microscope helped confirm this ionic shift.

All of these experimental results were backed up by computational modeling of the materials, which predicted behavior in excellent agreement with what was observed.

The electric field in these materials is present because the researchers were able to precisely control the growth process so that each interface has either a positive or negative charge. Alternating positively and negatively charged interfaces in the material produce nanoscale electric fields that can interact with the electrons and holes that are excited by solar energy. Electrons may then be driven to the surface, where they could interact with water molecules to break their bonds and produce hydrogen fuel.

Researchers are continuing to explore the properties of these superlattices using cutting-edge X-ray measurements at synchrotrons around the world and using other advanced microscopy techniques to look at the chemical makeup of the interfaces.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

And while nobody is suggesting there might actually be fish on Europa, this finding suggests the Jovian satellite could be capable of supporting the kinds of life familiar to us here on Earth, if only in microbial form.

Europa, which is roughly the size of Earth's moon, is enveloped by a global ocean about 100 miles deep (160 km), with an icy crust that may be only a few miles thick. From what we know of Earth, where there is water, there is a chance at life, so for many years scientists have speculated that this Jovian moon could support extraterrestrials.

As we learned more about Jupiter's effect on its moons, the possibility for life on Europa grew even more likely. Studies showed the moon could have enough oxygen to support the kind of life we are most familiar with on Earth.

IN PICTURES: Jupiter

The ice on the surface, like all water, is made from hydrogen and oxygen, and the constant stream of radiation pouring in from Jupiter reacts with this ice to form free oxygen and other oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide. The reactivity of oxygen is key to generating the energy that helped multi-cellular life flourish on our planet.

Still, researchers had thought there was no effective method for delivering any of this oxygen-rich matter into Europa's ocean. Scientists had assumed the primary way for surface materials to migrate downward was from the impacts it would suffer from cosmic debris, which regularly bombards everything in our solar system. [Photos of Jupiter's moons.]

However, past calculations suggested that even after a few billion years, such "impact gardening" would never lead to an oxygenated layer more than some 33 feet (10 meters) deep into the ice shell, nowhere far enough down to reach the underlying ocean.

However, the new study suggests this oxygen-rich layer could be far thicker than before thought, potentially encompassing the entire crust. The key is looking at other ways to stir Europa's crust, explained researcher Richard Greenberg, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at Tucson.

The gravitational pull Europa experiences from Jupiter leads to tidal forces roughly 1,000 times stronger than what Earth feels from our moon, flexing and heating Europa and making it very active geologically. This could explain why its surface appears no older than 50 million years old — its surface underwent complete turnover in that time

When it comes to why, exactly, the beach gets you feeling all Zen, there are a few factors at play, says Richard Shuster, PsyD, clinical psychologist and host of The Daily Helping podcast.

“The color blue has been found by an overwhelming amount of people to be associated with feelings of calm and peace,” says Shuster. “Staring at the ocean actually changes our brain waves’ frequency and puts us into a mild meditative state.” A study published in the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s journal even found that blue is associated with a boost of creativity.

The smell of the ocean breeze contributes to your soothed state, which may have something to do with the negative ions in the air that you’re breathing in.

Plus, that consistent ebbing and flowing you hear as you lie on your towel under an umbrella? “It kind of de-stimulates our brains,” says Shuster. The noises — coupled with the visuals — activate your parasympathetic nervous system, which is “responsible for slowing us down and allowing us to relax and feel more engaged,” says Sally Nazari, PsyD, owner of Chrysalis Psychological Services and host of the podcast Beyond the Couch.

The smell of the ocean breeze also contributes to your soothed state, which may have something to do with the negative ions in the air that you’re breathing in. These oxygen atoms have an extra electron and occur in places like waterfalls and the ocean, says Shuster. A study published in the

<|begin_of_text|>Researchers in Japan have found a way to make the 'wonder material' graphene superconductive - which means electricity can flow through it with zero resistance. The new property adds to graphene's already impressive list of attributes, like the fact that it's stronger than steel, harder than diamond, and incredibly flexible.

But superconductivity is a big deal, even for graphene, because when electricity can flow without resistance, it can lead to significantly more efficient electronic devices, not to mention power lines. Right now, energy companies are losing about 7 percent of their energy as heat as a result of resistance in the grid.

Before you get too excited, this demonstration of superconductivity in graphene occurred at a super cold -269 degrees Celsius, so we're not going to be making power lines out of graphene any time soon.

But what is exciting, is that this research suggests that graphene could be used to build nano-sized, high-speed electronic devices. Just imagine all the electricity we could save with computers that rely on tiny graphene circuity, capable of zooming electrons around without wasting energy as heat.

For those who aren't already familiar with graphene, the material is a one-atom-thick layer of graphite (the stuff that makes up your pencils), which is made up of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal honeycomb patterns.

The electrons inside graphene are already pretty special, because they're able to take on a special state called Dirac-cone, where they behave as if they have no mass. That makes them very speedy, but even though graphene is a very efficient conductor, it's not a superconductor, which is a state that requires zero resistance.

Now a team from Tohoku University and the University of Tokyo have managed to achieve superconductivity by creating two graphene sheets and inserting calcium atoms between them - sort of like a calcium sandwich, with graphene acting as the bread.

Takashi Takahashi

These graphene sheets were grown on a silicon carbide crystal (the SiC substrate in the image above), and the team was able to show that when the temperature gets to around 4 Kelvin, or -269 degrees Celsius, the electrical conductivity of the material rapidly drops - a clear indication of superconductivity.

Superconductivity generally relies on electrons not repelling each other, as they usually do, and pairing up instead, so they can flow through materials effortlessly. As you can imagine, when that happens in a material with electrons that are already acting like they have no mass, scientists get pretty excited.

<|begin_of_text|>ON A list of cutting-edge materials for high-tech applications, you might not expect to see wood near the top. But an experiment by Teng Li and Liangbing Hu of the University of Maryland may soon put it there. For Dr Li and Dr Hu, writing in Nano Letters, have just described how wood might be used to make one class of batteries cheaper by permitting the lithium now employed in them to be replaced with sodium.

As any high-school chemist knows, lithium and sodium are chemically similar. Sodium ions (sodium atoms with an electron missing, which makes them positively charged) are, however, five times the size of lithium ions. That matters because a battery works by shuttling ions between its anode and its cathode. The bigger the ion, the more damage this shuttling causes—and the shorter, in consequence, is the battery’s life. Hitherto, that has ruled sodium out as a plausible ingredient of batteries. But engineers would still like to devise a commercially viable sodium battery, because sodium is much more abundant than lithium.

Dr Li and Dr Hu wondered if the problem of electrode damage might be ameliorated by using a more pliant material for the frames on which the electrodes are suspended. These frames, which also transmit current to and from the electrodes, are normally made of metal, and are therefore rigid. But the two researchers reckoned that suitably treated wood could do the job of conduction equally well while providing more yielding support for an electrode that was continually expanding and contracting as ions moved in and out of it.

To test this idea, they used slivers of wood from yellow pines. First, they coated these with carbon nanotubes, to improve their conductivity. Then they applied a film of tin to each sliver. (Tin is the preferred material for the anode in a lithium or sodium battery.) This done, they immersed the slivers in an electrolyte containing sodium ions and put the resulting battery through 400 cycles of discharging and recharging. As a control, they built similar batteries using slivers of copper.

The wooden battery was not perfect. Its initial capacity was 339 milliamp hours per gram (mAH/g), but that fell to 145 mAH/g over the course of the 400 cycles. This, however, was not bad for a prototype, and far better than the copper-framed batteries managed. They had an initial capacity of

All Android apps are deployed and contained in so called APK files. APK files are really just ZIP archives that contain a few mandatory folders and metadata files in addition to the application binary and application resource files such as images, XML layout files, arbitrary binary data, etc.

Good And Folly

APK files are a good medium for distributing Android apps as they cram the myriad pieces of an app into one convenient archive which is easy to copy and distribute. The APK folly is that installed apps are never extracted from the archive and placed in a simple folder. Instead they are kept in the archive.

Why

Ok, so you ask why is keeping installed apps in APK files an incredibly foolish design choice? Simply, because it requires all code that accesses a resource file to deal specially with the APK file format.

This may not seem like much of an issue since the SDK provides a couple of mechanisms to use and access resources. Nearly all classes that use resource files accept resource IDs defined in the auto-generated R.java file and the SDK takes care of loading the resources for you. Even better, there is the Resources class for accessing resources directly by obtaining InputStream instances to them and even AssetFileDescriptors for them.

These mechanism don’t really solve the problem. In the first instance, the SDK is simply hiding the underlying problem by accepting the resource IDs and accessing the APK file behind the scenes. Obviously, the SDK still has special code to extract resources from the APK file. Special code that exists only for specific file types (images, XML layouts, etc.) explicitly handled by the SDK in this way.

The second instance is not really a solution, it is a manifestation of the problem. The resource files are buried in the APK file and we need the Resources class to access them. All the standard methods of opening a file, in Java or native C, are useless. You can’t use new FileInputStream() in Java or open() a file in C. We need special code that is aware of the APK format and uses the designated APIs to extract files from it.

At least in theory. In practice the Resources class does not provide a real solution for accessing APK resource files from C. There is an extremely convoluted method of obtaining the APK’s file descriptor in Java from an undocumented member of an AssetFileDescriptor instance, obtaining the offset and length of the resource in the APK file and passing the triplet through JNI. You can read about it here. The alternative is to compile your native code with libzip support and to process the APK file yourself

<|begin_of_text|>A low-cost, high-speed method for printing graphene inks using a conventional roll-to-roll printing process, like that used to print newspapers and crisp packets, could open up a wide range of practical applications, including inexpensive printed electronics, intelligent packaging and disposable sensors.

Developed by researchers at the University of Cambridge in collaboration with Cambridge-based technology company Novalia, the method allows graphene and other electrically conducting materials to be added to conventional water-based inks and printed using typical commercial equipment, the first time that graphene has been used for printing on a large-scale commercial printing press at high speed.

Graphene is a two-dimensional sheet of carbon atoms, just one atom thick. Its flexibility, optical transparency and electrical conductivity make it suitable for a wide range of applications, including printed electronics. Although numerous laboratory prototypes have been demonstrated around the world, widespread commercial use of graphene is yet to be realised.

“We are pleased to be the first to bring graphene inks close to real-world manufacturing. There are lots of companies that have produced graphene inks, but none of them has done it on a scale close to this,” said Dr Tawfique Hasan of the Cambridge Graphene Centre (CGC), who developed the method. “Being able to produce conductive inks that could effortlessly be used for printing at a commercial scale at a very high speed will open up all kinds of different applications for graphene and other similar materials.”

“This method will allow us to put electronic systems into entirely unexpected shapes,” said Chris Jones of Novalia. “It’s an incredibly flexible enabling technology.”

Hasan’s method, developed at the University’s Nanoscience Centre, works by suspending tiny particles of graphene in a ‘carrier’ solvent mixture, which is added to conductive water-based ink formulations. The ratio of the ingredients can be adjusted to control the liquid’s properties, allowing the carrier solvent to be easily mixed into a conventional conductive water-based ink to significantly reduce the resistance. The same method works for materials other than graphene, including metallic, semiconducting and insulating nanoparticles.

Currently, printed conductive patterns use a combination of poorly conducting carbon with other materials, most commonly silver, which is expensive. Silver-based inks cost £1000 or more per kilogram, whereas this new graphene ink formulation would be 25 times cheaper. Additionally, silver is not recyclable, while graphene and other carbon materials can easily be recycled. The new method uses cheap, non-toxic and environmentally friendly solvents that can be dried quickly at room temperature,

I thought it would be a few years before we saw hydrogen fuel cells used in camping… but here they are…

One of the award winners at this year’s Outdoor Trade Show was the Hydrogen Fuel Cell USB charger from Brunton.

This phone charger takes lightweight hydrogen fuel cells that releases hydrogen into a reactor to generate power, and only releases water vapour, not fumes.

They estimate that a single hydrogen fuel cell, which just looks like a metal cylinder, is equivalent to 15AA batteries and should be enough for 6 mobile phone charges.

The reactor comes with two hydrogen fuel cells, and more can be purchased (believed to be around £4 each).

Now for most of us family campers, we usually camp with our car, and so a 12V adaptor that fits in the car usually does the trick. Solar powered chargers have also improved recently, and the Coleman CPX Lanterns also come with a USB charging solution. However, the use of hydrogen fuel cells and their promise of ‘clean’ energy has really been only in university research departments. Until now.

We had a play with the Brunton hydrogen reactor at the show. It’s really lightweight and small – ideal to fit in a back pack.

So whilst this is not something high on the list for family camping, it’s a useful bit of kit if you are going to be away from a power source for a while, and it is an interesting piece of high-tech gadgetry aimed at campers and hikers.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Microwaves are radio waves with frequencies ranging from around 300 million cycles per second (300 MHz) to 3 GHz. RF. A standard measure of exposure for microwave energy is the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) or rate of tissue energy absorption measured in watts per kilogram of tissue.

Microwave radiation leakage can damage human cells and tissues.

All appliances working on electricity produce a toxic electromagnetic field (EMF) of approximately 60 hertz. This is over and above potential microwave leakage from appliances or devices.

Microwave ovens can leak

Microwave leakage is serious enough that the FDA sets strict limits on it for the manufacturers. But once door seals age, leaking tends to exceed those limits, often at head level. That’s bad news, because the microwave energy inside a microwave oven is massive!

Frequency inside your microwave 2.45 BILLION hertz.

Frequency shown to start harming the human body: over 10 hertz

That’s 2.45 billion vs. 10 hertz. It doesn’t take very big leak for the damage to begin. (One top culprit: aging door seals)

The facts about microwaves & cataracts

Eyes are especially vulnerable to microwaves. That’s because unlike other areas of the body, they lack the blood vessels to dissipate the heat and cellular stress.

The first suspected clinical case of microwave-caused cataracts was reported by Hirsch and Parker as early as 1950's. (Sulman 1980).

For decades, cataracts have been reported in workers exposed to this type of radiation. (On the back of the lens where radiation cataracts usually occur.)

What do microwaves do to food?

In a microwave oven, alternating current forces atoms reverse polarity at a startlingly high rate. This creates such violent friction that the water inside the food molecules begin to vibrate and heat up.

The dangers of microwaved foods.

Microwaves break chemical and molecular bonds, and can literally rip atoms apart, disrupting the basic biochemical structures of life. It’s no wonder foods cooked in such a way become so harmful to consume.Government and industry studies suggest they pose no threat, but a growing body of knowledge now contradicts those claims.

Microwaved foods lose nutrition.

The Swiss scientist Hans Hertel, was the first to study microwave dangers, specifically, how cooking degrades and depletes food of nutrients—an effect that shows up in study participants' blood samples.

<|begin_of_text|>This is a ground-breaking philosophical exploration of consciousness and the self as they occur across the states of waking, falling asleep, dreaming, lucid dreaming, deep dreamless sleep, out-of-body experiences and dying. Evan Thompson's rich, beautifully written book interweaves lucid prose with relevant personal anecdotes, bringing the latest neuroscience together with ancient contemplative wisdom to offer valuable insight into the nature of consciousness and the self. The first-person methodologies of Indian and Asian contemplative traditions such as Yoga, Vedānta and Buddhism generate data that go beyond the reach of the standard scientific approach taken by Western neuroscience and psychology, for example on the possible presence of consciousness during deep dreamless sleep. At the same time, the Western scientific and philosophical approach serves to temper some of Indian metaphysical assertions, such as the claim that consciousness does not depend upon the brain. Thompson argues convincingly that the different approaches -- combined to form 'neurophenomenology' -- produce data that reinforce and complement each other, solidifying findings that, from just one perspective, would be more speculative (for example, that a minimal moment of reportable object-directed awareness is 10-20ms). One of main theses to emerge from the study is that the self is a fluid process, not a static thing, nor the illusion of a thing. Like clouds, the 'I-making' enacted self breaks up and re-forms with the different states of being, and like a sunlit sky, the luminous and pure background consciousness is able reveal the workings and contents of both, all the more so if cultivated as a meta-awareness through practices of meditation and mindfulness.

An outstanding feature is the book's accessible presentation of up-to-date empirical data on both neuro-psychological research and its interface with studies on meditation. Thompson is unusually well-placed to write such a book. A meditation practitioner and lucid dreamer himself, he's also a renowned philosopher of mind who has for years been an active participant in dialogues among key players in the field, such as his well-known (now-deceased) mentor the cognitive neuroscientist Francisco Varela, the Dalai Lama and leading meditation neuroscientist Richard Davidson. His philosophical contributions to the field of cognitive science (including several previous books) enable him to synthesise the inter-disciplinary findings in a way that not only offers novel answers to existing questions but, like a tantalising Scrabble word, also opens up the field to provocative questions that invite new directions of critical engagement.

Researchers dream of making miniature, flexible electronic circuits from films just a few atoms thick. But growing such 2D films at the scale needed to produce batches of reliable electronic devices has been a challenge.

Nature podcast Reporter Lizzie Gibney finds a class of materials with exotic properties – but can they one day rival silicon? You may need a more recent browser or to install the latest version of the Adobe Flash Plugin.

Now materials scientists have devised a way to grow single layers of a promising class of 2D semiconductor on silicon wafers that are 10 centimetres across — all the while maintaining the impressive electronic properties seen in smaller samples1. They used the films to make hundreds of transistors, which tests showed worked in 99% of cases.

“Lots of people are trying to grow single layers on this large scale, myself among them,” says Georg Duesberg, a materials scientist at Trinity College Dublin. “But it looks like these guys have really done it.”

The semiconductors in question are known as transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). A single-layer TMD is three atoms thick: it comprises a sheet of atoms from a family of elements called transition metals (which include molybdenum and tungsten) sandwiched between two layers of chalcogen atoms (such as sulfur, selenium and tellurium).

Like their carbon-based cousin graphene, TMD sheets are strong, thin and flexible and conduct electrons. But unlike graphene, they are also semiconductors — meaning that the flow of electrons can be easily switched off and on. TMDs are unlikely ever to replace the most famous semiconductor, silicon, whose manufacture has been honed over decades. But they could form films more than a thousand times thinner than today's components made from silicon slabs, allowing for flexible transistors, displays, and light detectors.

Large layers

TMD layers can be peeled from a multi-layered crystal, much as graphene can be pulled from graphite with sticky tape. But the results can be inconsistent and the process is time consuming. An alternative — growing the material atom by atom from a gas of precursor chemicals — has so far produced only small-area samples that are often more than one layer thick.

Publishing in Nature1 on 29 April, Jiwoong Park at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and his colleagues have adapted this technique to grow large single-layer films. Over 26 hours and at a temperature of 550 °C,

<|begin_of_text|>Thanks to data collected by ESA’s Cluster spacecraft and a NASA mission called the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE), scientists have solved a long-standing space mystery – the origin of a colorful display in the night sky known as the theta aurora.

Auroras are the most visible manifestation of the Sun’s effect on Earth.

They are caused by the solar wind, a stream of plasma – electrically charged atomic particles – carrying its own magnetic field, interacting with the magnetic field of our planet.

Normally, the main region for this impressive display is the ‘auroral oval’, which lies at around 65-70 degrees north or south of the equator, encircling the polar caps.

However, auroras can occur at even higher latitudes. One type is known as a theta aurora because seen from above it looks like the Greek letter Θ (theta) – an oval with a line crossing through the center.

While the genesis of the auroral oval emissions is reasonably well understood, the origin of the theta aurora was unclear until now.

The new study, published in the journal Science, shows that hot plasma funneled into near-Earth space from the Sun helps cause these unique aurora.

“Previously it was unclear whether this hot plasma was a result of direct solar wind entry through the lobes of the magnetosphere, or if the plasma is somehow related to the plasma sheet on the night side of Earth,” said study lead author Dr Robert Fear of the University of Southampton.

“The possibilities have been debated since the first satellite observations of the phenomenon were made in the 1980s.”

The mystery was finally solved by studying data collected simultaneously by the IMAGE satellite and Cluster’s PEACE electron spectrometer instruments on September 15, 2005.

While the four Cluster satellites were located in the southern hemisphere magnetic lobe, IMAGE had a wide-field view of the southern hemisphere aurora.

As one Cluster satellite observed uncharacteristically energetic plasma in the lobe, IMAGE saw the ‘arc’ of the theta aurora cross the magnetic footprint of Cluster.

“We found that the energetic plasma signatures occur on high-latitude magnetic field lines that have been closed by the process of magnetic reconnection, which then causes the plasma to become relatively hot,” Dr Fear explained.

“Because the field lines are closed, the observations are incompatible with direct entry from the solar wind.”

“By testing this and other predictions about the behavior of the theta aurora, our observations provide strong evidence that the plasma trapping mechanism is responsible for

It’s O.K. to be mean to lumpy, lardy people. It’s a sort of subtle intolerance towards people that’s very bad.”

Thanks to the ubiquity of cameras, wearing a bikini is now scary even for gorgeous celebrities. Remember how Jennifer Love Hewitt was pilloried in 2007 for the crime of wearing a bandeau without being a size 0? Helen Mirren was accused of having had surgery when she dared to flaunt her (taut, toned) 62-year-old stomach in a tomato-red bikini a year later.

“It’s about everyone everywhere having a comment, and they are anonymous,” said Gabrielle Reece, the former volleyball star and now a fitness guru, who has also been captured bare-stomached by the paparazzi. “The bathing suit is really a metaphor for all the ways we can approach a lot of things,” she said. “Why would we punish ourselves when we don’t have to? Why dread that?”

But the bikini has become the star of several fear-inspiring marketing campaigns. A recent advertisement for Yoplait Light features an itsy-bitsy yellow-and-red polka dotted bikini hanging on a wall as a future award for the diligent yogurt eater.

Nivea has a Goodbye Cellulite, Hello Bikini! Challenge, which prods women to slim down and buy its products. Nivea also sponsors the Cosmopolitan Magazine Bikini Bash, which last year involved 100 lithe dancers in blue-and-white ruffled bikinis tossing their hair violently to the Midi Mafia’s song “Two-Piece” in front of 1,000 attendees at the Planet Hollywood resort in Las Vegas. The two male singers of “Two-Piece,” fully clothed, belted, “You all look like models off the cover of Cosmo.”

Amansala, a “bikini boot camp,” in Ibiza, Spain, and Tulum, Mexico, sells six-night stays starting at $1,875. “Our society definitely has a stigma of bikini readiness — my business thrives on that,” said Melissa Perlman, an owner of the resort, which she said mostly attracts women in their 30s and 40s. “But at the same time, we

This technology, however, has much broader applications. As governments move to release more data and documents online, verifying the authenticity of those files will become increasingly important. In the future, governments could use blockchains to track and verify the ownership of property records, banking records, securities or anything else posted on an open data platform.

Brian Forde, the director of the MIT Media Lab's Digital Currency Initiative, explores the concept in the video below.

By 2020, using blockchain technology might even become a best practice for the verification of public records online.

Makes sense, @digiphile. You could be right. — Jessica Rosenworcel (@JRosenworcel) August 31, 2015

"Property records, particularly in the developing world, are notoriously subject to hacking," Oliver Goodenough, a professor at Vermont Law School, observed in an interview. "Honduras got money to do an electronic record land registry, but when they were done, many key properties were held by relatives of people who set up the ledger. Now, a contract was awarded to a company in Texas to set up a blockchain-based property system."

That example and others are drawing attention in other contexts, from countries around the world. In the United States, the blockchain might be a way of validating voter records before and after elections, making entries perusable and insulating them from fraud. It might also be relevant to securities, adding a technological component that would make fraud by corrupt officials much harder.

Given how blockchain technology has matured in recent years, Goodenough says it's just going to require hard work to get it into use -- and he hopes that Vermont will be a leader in that area.

"This could give sunshine and make it very hard to screw the system," he told me. "The blockchain will not cook us breakfast, but it might tell us who cooked breakfast."

For more, watch Goodenough's talk earlier this year at Stanford (embedded below) on the state of legal technology:

Governments haven't been the biggest fans of Bitcoin, given the use of the cryptocurrency on the shadier parts of the Internet, including drug deals on the Deep Web. But at least one recognizes the potential of blockchains.

<|begin_of_text|>Fresh Christmas trees are a holiday tradition, loved for their beauty and fresh, outdoorsy fragrance. However, Christmas trees often take the blame for destructive fires that occur during the holiday season. The most effective way to prevent Christmas tree fires is to keep the tree well hydrated. With proper care, a tree should remain fresh for two to three weeks. This may sound easy, but it becomes a problem if your Christmas tree is not drinking water.

Causes for a Christmas Tree Not Taking Up Water

Generally, when Christmas trees have problems taking up water, it’s because we tend to add products to the tree itself or the water. Avoid spray-on fire retardants and other products advertised to keep your tree fresh. Similarly, bleach, vodka, aspirin, sugar, lime soda, copper pennies or vodka have little or no effect and some can actually slow water retention and increase moisture loss.

What works best? Plain old tap water. If you tend to be forgetful, keep a pitcher or watering can near the tree to remind you.

How to Get a Christmas Tree to Take Up Water

Cutting a thin sliver from the bottom of the trunk is key to keeping a tree fresh. Keep in mind that if the tree is freshly cut, you don’t need to cut the trunk. However, if the tree has been cut for longer than 12 hours before you put it in water, you must trim ¼ to ½ inch from the bottom of the trunk.

This is because the bottom of the trunk seals itself with sap after a few hours and can’t absorb water. Cut straight across and not at an angle; an angular cut makes it harder for the tree to take up water. It is also difficult to get a tree with an angular cut to stand upright. Also, don’t drill a hole in the trunk. It doesn’t help.

Next, a large stand is critical; a Christmas tree can drink up to one quart of water for each inch of stem diameter. The National Christmas Tree Association recommends a stand with a one-gallon capacity. Never trim the bark to accommodate a too-tight stand. The bark helps the tree take up water.

Christmas Tree Watering Tips

Start with a fresh Christmas tree. There’s no way to hydrate a dried up tree, even if you trim the bottom. If you aren’t sure about freshness, pull a branch slowly through your fingers. A few dry needles are no reason for concern, but look for a fresher tree if a large number of needles are loose or brittle.

This month, at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, physicists and engineers built tracks inside one of its fusion reactors and ran a toy train on them for three days.

It was not an exercise in silliness, but in calibration.

The modified model of a diesel train engine was carrying a small chunk of californium-252, a radioactive element that spews neutrons as it falls apart.

The spherical torus experiment is a small reactor designed to test new approaches to fusion, in which hydrogen atoms are fused together at ultrahigh temperatures to produce energy — as the Sun does.

The western 'head' region consists mostly of heavily cratered 'alpine' terrain. The middle part of Cthulhu Macula is meanwhile a smooth plain, probably formed through large cryovolcanic eruptions, like Vulcan Planum on Charon. This part appears to be younger than the alpine terrain to the east, but there are nevertheless several large craters located in this region. The western 'tail' region of Cthulhu Macula was imaged in much lower resolution than the eastern part, but it can be inferred that this is a hilly landscape bordered by mountains to the west.[9][10][11] Higher-resolution images of the border between the two regions indicate that lighter material from Sputnik Planitia, composed of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane ices, may be invading and overlaying the easternmost part of the dark Cthulhu Macula.[12] As of 30 July 2015, the eastern "head" region had been imaged in much higher resolution than the western "tail" region.[13]

A photogenic and favorite target for amateur astronomers, the full beauty of nearby barred spiral galaxy M83 is unveiled in all of its glory in this Hubble Space Telescope mosaic image. The vibrant magentas and blues reveal that the galaxy is ablaze with star formation. The galaxy, also known as the Southern Pinwheel, lies 15 million light-years away in the constellation Hydra.

The Hubble photograph captures thousands of star clusters, hundreds of thousands of individual stars, and “ghosts” of dead stars called supernova remnants. The galactic panorama unveils a tapestry of the drama of stellar birth and death spread across 50,000 light-years.

The newest generations of stars are forming largely in clusters on the edges of the dark spiral dust lanes. These brilliant young stellar groupings, only a few million years old, produce huge amounts of ultraviolet light that is absorbed by surrounding diffuse gas clouds, causing them to glow in pinkish hydrogen light.

Gradually, the fierce stellar winds from the youngest most massive stars blow away the gas, revealing bright blue star clusters and giving a “Swiss cheese” appearance to the spiral arms. These youngest star clusters are about 1 million to 10 million years old. The populations of stars up to 100 million years or older appear yellow or orange by comparison because the young blue stars have already burned out.

Interstellar “bubbles” produced by nearly 300 supernovas from massive stars have been found in this Hubble image. By studying these supernova remnants, astronomers can better understand the nature of the stars that exploded and dispersed nuclear processed chemical elements back into the galaxy, contributing to the next generation of new stars.

This image is being used to support a citizen science project titled STAR DATE: M83. The primary goal is to estimate ages for approximately 3,000 star clusters. Amateur scientists will use the presence or absence of the pink hydrogen emission, the sharpness of the individual stars, and the color of the clusters to estimate ages. Participants will measure the sizes of the star clusters and any associated emission nebulae. Finally, the citizen scientists will “explore” the image, identifying a variety of objects ranging from background galaxies to supernova remnants to foreground stars.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Many people who work in fusion power look 50 to 100 years into the future, and we say 'what else can provide a sustainable clean energy source for thousands of years on a large scale,' and fusion's one of the only ways to do that, Mauel says.

When you hear the term nuclear energy, images of Fukushima or Three Mile Island may come to mind. But harnessing nuclear power isn't limited to the reactors that we currently use, which rely on nuclear fission. Energy can also be harnessed from fusion."Nuclear fusion is the energy that powers the sun and stars," Mike Mauel, professor of applied physics at Columbia University, told CBSNews.com. "It takes hydrogen gas, heating up to millions of degrees, and brings the atoms together to release energy and make helium."Instead of splitting an atom's nucleus, like in fission, nuclear fusion is the process of bringing together two atomic nuclei to form a new nucleus. And there is no need for dangerous chemical elements like uranium or plutonium -- easing the fears of nuclear proliferation. Energy derived from fusion is appealing because very few natural resources are required to create fuel.According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), approximately 68 percent of the country's electricity in 2011 was generated by coal, natural gas, petroleum, and oil. The next highest energy source was nuclear energy at about 20 percent. About 13 percent was contributed by renewable sources, like solar, hydropower, wind, geothermal and biomass.A United Nations panel of scientists has reportedly agreed, with near certainty, that humans have a direct influence on climate change. The organization is expected to release its findings in an upcoming annual report."It is extremely likely that human influence on climate caused more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010," says a draft of the report, obtained by the New York Times. "There is high confidence that this has warmed the ocean, melted snow and ice, raised global mean sea level and changed some climate extremes in the second half of the 20th century."For the first time in recorded history, the amount of carbon dioxide in the air could rise to 400 parts per million (ppm) -- it's currently just over 390

Conversely, a reduction in taxes followed by a reduction in spending reduces the GDP, and therefore increases unemployment.

In this particular case (repeal of the ACA), the reduction in taxes benefits higher income people who have a relatively low “marginal propensity to consume” (Google it!), MPC, and negatively affects lower income people, who have a relatively higher MPC. The net effect is that a reduction in taxes and an equal reduction in spending will decrease the GDP by an amount larger than the reduction in taxes. The effect on the unemployment rate will be larger than predicted by the BBM.

Will the repeal of the ACA be the trigger for the next recession/depression?

How long will it take for the country to be plunged into a depression? (a) two years (b) four years (c) eight years.

It will depend on how large are the tax and spending cuts.

Incidentally, things getting worse may not even be Mr. Trump's doing. While we liberals are not cheering for the success of most Trump's policies, all conscientious citizens should be extra vigilant when economic turns bad and lives get tough. History has repeatedly told us that tough times were the breeding group for authoritarians and fascists. Demagogues never had solutions but they had risen by channeling the anger of the people against chosen minorities. I hope that America will stay prosperous despite Trump and his regressive policies will be reversed over time. I hope that if bad economic times will come, we will choose a wise and compassionate leader next time to take us out of it. However, history should have taught us to be watchful; this election has shown that the wisdom of, we, the American people is not infallible. Flag

It is hard to imagine you could reconstruct a record of fog dating back thousands of years, but this is exactly what Chilean scientists have done.

The low-lying cloud is seemingly so transient and intangible, and unlike rivers and glaciers it leaves no easy-to-read impressions on the landscape.

And yet, a Santiago team has been able to trace the fog history of the Atacama Desert by studying Tillandsia plants.

Their chemistry suggests strongly that this local fog has increased over time.

It is a period covering the last 3,500 years.

"I don't think there's any other place in the world where I've actually seen a record of fog, even spanning the last hundred years," said Claudio Latorre Hidalgo from the Catholic University of Chile.

"What little we know about fog is from measurement instrumental data that we have, and from satellite data that only spans the last 20 years.

"So, this is actually a unique opportunity to study the evolution of a fog ecosystem over the Late Holocene, and what are the major drivers and controls of the mechanisms that produce that fog in the long term - the very long term."

The palaeoclimate expert was discussing his team's research here at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union - the world's largest annual gathering of Earth scientists.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Claudio Latorre Hidalgo: "The fog is the plants’ only source of water and nutrients"

The Atacama is famous for its super-arid conditions; there are places where it has not rained for years.

But life can eke out an existence if it can exploit the fog that rolls in off the Pacific. Tillandsia are a perfectly adapted opportunist.

These wiry, grey plants have no roots. They clutch weakly at sand dunes, but arrange themselves at every spatial scale to maximise their capture of the fog.

Science teaches without reservation that life begins at fertilization (conception). It is a scientific fact that an organism exists after fertilization that did not exist before. This new organism has its own DNA distinct from the mother and father, meaning that it is a unique person. As the embryo grows, it develops a heartbeat (22 days after fertilization), its own circulatory system, and its own organs. From fertilization, it is a new organism that is alive and will continue to grow and develop as long as nutrition is provided and its life is not ended through violence or illness.

It is indisputably human, as it has human DNA.

The offspring of two members of a species is always the same type of creature as the parents. No two dogs will ever conceive and give birth to a cat; no fish egg will ever produce a snake. According to all the laws of nature, the preborn baby is human.

Scientific textbooks proclaim this fact. Keith L. Moore’s The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology (7th edition, Philadelphia, PA: Saunders, 2003) states the following:

A zygote [fertilized egg] is the beginning of a new human being. Human development begins at fertilization, the process during which a male gamete … unites with a female gamete or oocyte … to form a single cell called a zygote. This highly specialized, totipotent cell marks the beginning of each of us as a unique individual.

“Zygote” is a scientific term for the new life that is created when the sperm and the egg combine. “Oocyte” is another term for the egg cell, the cell released by woman’s ovary, which travels down the Fallopian tube and is fertilized by the male sperm.

The author of this scientific textbook, Keith L. Moore, is a world-renowned embryologist. He has written a number of definitive books on embryology, and his scientific knowledge and experience are vast and beyond reproach. Few medical students can complete their careers without studying from his textbooks.

Moore puts it even more plainly in Before We Are Born: Essentials of Embryology (7th edition, Philadelphia, PA: Saunders, 2008, p. 2):

[The zygote], formed by the union of an oocyte and a sperm, is the beginning of a new human being.

<|begin_of_text|>"EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW"-These words, written above the main entrance to the Supreme Court Building, express the ultimate responsibility of the Supreme Court of the United States. The Court is the highest tribunal in the Nation for all cases and controversies arising under the Constitution or the laws of the United States. As the final arbiter of the law, the Court is charged with ensuring the American people the promise of equal justice under law and, thereby, also functions as guardian and interpreter of the Constitution.

The Supreme Court is "distinctly American in concept and function," as Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes observed. Few other courts in the world have the same authority of constitutional interpretation and none have exercised it for as long or with as much influence. A century and a half ago, the French political observer Alexis de Tocqueville noted the unique position of the Supreme Court in the history of nations and of jurisprudence. "The representative system of government has been adopted in several states of Europe," he remarked, "but I am unaware that any nation of the globe has hitherto organized a judicial power in the same manner as the Americans.... A more imposing judicial power was never constituted by any people."

The unique position of the Supreme Court stems, in large part, from the deep commitment of the American people to the Rule of Law and to constitutional government. The United States has demonstrated an unprecedented determination to preserve and protect its written Constitution, thereby providing the American "experiment in democracy" with the oldest written Constitution still in force.

The Constitution of the United States is a carefully balanced document. It is designed to provide for a national government sufficiently strong and flexible to meet the needs of the republic, yet sufficiently limited and just to protect the guaranteed rights of citizens; it permits a balance between society’s need for order and the individual’s right to freedom. To assure these ends, the Framers of the Constitution created three independent and coequal branches of government. That this Constitution has provided continuous democratic government through the periodic stresses of more than two centuries illustrates the genius of the American system of government.

The complex role of the Supreme Court in this system derives from its authority to invalidate legislation or executive actions which, in the Court’s considered judgment, conflict with the Constitution. This power of "judicial review" has given the Court a crucial responsibility in assuring individual rights, as well as in maintaining a "living Constitution" whose broad provisions are continually applied to complicated new situations.

While the function of judicial review is not explicitly provided in the Constitution, it

Luckily no one had to find out: Key substitutions in hairsprays and refrigerants allowed such products to exist without chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which were found to be ripping a huge "hole" in Earth's protective ozone layer.

Today the ozone hole, which was first spotted 25 years ago, appears headed for a happy ending, thanks to unprecedented international action.

Could a similar effort rein in climate change? And is the closing ozone hole actually making global warming worse?

Ozone at High Risk From CFCs

The ozone layer lies between about 9.3 and 18.6 miles (15 and 30 kilometers) above Earth's surface. This blanket of ozone, or O3, blocks most of the sun's high-frequency ultraviolet rays.

These UV rays can cause skin cancer and cataracts in humans, as well as reproductive problems in fish, crabs, frogs, and even in the single-celled phytoplankton at the bottom of the ocean food chain.

Ozone is created naturally when oxygen molecules (O2) high in the atmosphere get broken by sunlight into two free oxygen atoms. A free atom can then bond with an unbroken O2 molecule, and ozone is born.

Ozone is unstable, however, and it's easily broken up by trace elements.

Invented in the 1920s, CFCs proved to be an exceptional problem for ozone, because many of these synthetic chemicals can persist for decades, allowing them to make their way into the upper atmosphere. (Related: "Rocket Launches Damage Ozone Layer, Study Says.")

In that rarefied air, ultraviolet light breaks the molecular bonds in CFCs and free chlorine atoms get released. Chlorine then destroys ozone molecules by "stealing" their oxygen atoms.

Ozone Hole a Shocking Surprise

Scientists had theorized since the 1970s about the chemistry that could lead to ozone depletion. But in May 1985 scientists with the British Antarctic Survey shocked the world when they announced the discovery of a huge hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica.

Technically a substantial thinning of the ozone layer, the ozone "hole" has been opening every spring since the 1970s, the scientists reported.

Their data, collected at the Halley Research Station in Antarctica, suggested that CFCs were to blame. That's because atmospheric conditions during the cold, dark,

An explosion last month that caused a University of Hawaii, Manoa, postdoctoral researcher to lose an arm was caused by a spark from a digital pressure gauge that was not designed for use with flammable gases, says a Honolulu Fire Department investigation report.

Thea Ekins-Coward was combining hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and oxygen gases from high-pressure cylinders into a lower pressure tank when the incident occurred. She has not given the university permission to release information about her condition, said spokesman Daniel Meisenzahl at an April 18 press conference.

The gas mixture was “food” for bacteria being used to produce biofuels and bioplastics. Ekins-Coward was working for the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute under researcher Jian Yu. A 2013 paper by Yu indicates a set-up in which gases are plumbed through a mixing device called a gas proportioner directly into the bioreactor (Int. J. Hydrogen Energy 2013, DOI: 10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.04.153). The gas gauge identified in the paper is an “intrinsically safe” model designed to prevent ignition.

But after Ekins-Coward started in the lab last fall, she purchased a 49-L steel gas tank, a different gauge not rated as intrinsically safe, a pressure-relief valve, and fittings, and she put them together, Yu and Ekins-Coward told fire department investigators, according to the report. Ekins-Coward would add the gases to the portable tank, which would then be connected to the bioreactor. She was using a mixture of 70% hydrogen, 25% oxygen, and 5% carbon dioxide for her experiments, the report says.

In the week before the incident, a similar set-up with a 3.8-L tank resulted in a “small internal explosion” when Ekins-Coward pressed the off button on the gauge, the fire department report says. She also occasionally experienced static shocks when touching the tank, which was not grounded. She reported the shocks and possibly the small explosion to Yu, who told her not to worry about it, the report says.

On the day of the incident, the 49-L tank exploded when Ekins-Coward pressed the off button on the gauge. “She did not lose consciousness or hit her head; she was aware that she lost her arm in the explosion,” the report

A Word from the Developer

Greetings, admirals!

This version of the FAQ includes a few card clarifications and a couple of important rules updates. We’ve clarified that when you’re attacking squadrons, each roll against a different squadron counts as a separate attack. This is why you can resolve cards like Point-Defense Reroute and Dominator against each squadron you attack, not just one. Also, there were some edge cases in ship targeting where attacks that didn’t seem like they should be legal were indeed legal. We’ve clamped down on that by adding the rule that line of sight is broken if your attack’s range is measured through one of the defender’s hull zones. Most players are already playing this way without realizing it; now it’s codified.

Thanks again to everyone who sends in rules questions!

The Star Wars: Armada tournament rules have seen some minor updates. While the initial document was solid, our tournament software, currently in beta, has created the need to update how pairings and strength of schedule work.

Before we started work on our tournament software, stores and tournament organizers were often forced to run tournaments by hand. While many TOs have the math skills to run large tournaments with complicated tiebreakers, the time this adds to a tournament is significant and detrimental to players’ experiences. This limited the rules governing pairings and tiebreakers for our games in the past, but tournament software opens the possibilities of new methods and we have taken advantage of them to improve our tournaments.

<|begin_of_text|>The gustatory system creates the human sense of taste, allowing us to perceive different flavors from substances that we consume as food and drink. Gustation, along with olfaction (the sense of smell), is classified as chemoreception. Because it functions by reacting with molecular chemical compounds in a given substance. Specialized cells in the gustatory system that are located on the tongue are called taste buds, and they sense tastants (taste molecules). The taste buds send the information after coming in contact with food from the tastants to the brain, where a molecule is processed as a certain taste. There are five main tastes: bitter, salty, sweet, sour, and umami (savory). All the varieties of flavor we experience are a combination of some or all of these tastes.

The sense of taste is transduced by taste buds. Which are clusters of 50-100 taste receptor cells located in the tongue, soft palate, epiglottis, pharynx, and esophagus. The tongue is the main sensory organ of the gustatory system. The tongue contains papillae, or specialized epithelial cells, which have taste buds on their surface. There are three types of papillae with taste buds in the human gustatory system:

Loading...

fungiform papillae, which are mushroom-shaped and located at the tip of the tongue;

foliate papillae, which are ridges and grooves toward the back of the tongue;

circumvallate papillae, which are circular-shaped and located in a row just in front of the end of the tongue.

You can’t taste food unless it’s mixed with your saliva

Each taste bud is flask-like in shape and formed by two types of cells: supporting cells and gustatory cells. Gustatory cells are short-lived and are continuously regenerating. They each contain a taste pore at the surface of the tongue which is the site of sensory transduction. Though there are small differences in sensation, all taste buds, no matter their location, can respond to all types of taste.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

For the agricultural and industrial processes for producing whole coffee beans, see Coffee processing

Filter coffee being brewed

Coffee preparation is the process of turning coffee beans into a beverage. While the particular steps vary with the type of coffee and with the raw materials, the process includes four basic steps: raw coffee beans must be roasted, the roasted coffee beans must then be ground, the ground coffee must then be mixed with hot water for a certain time (brewed), and finally the liquid coffee must be separated from the used grounds.

Coffee is usually brewed immediately before drinking. In most areas, coffee may be purchased unprocessed, or already roasted, or already roasted and ground. Coffee is often vacuum packed to prevent oxidation and lengthen its shelf life.

Roasting [ edit ]

Dutch coffee-roasting machine, c. 1920

Roasting coffee transforms the chemical and physical properties of green coffee beans. When roasted, the green coffee bean expands to nearly double its original size, changing in color and density. As the bean absorbs heat, its color shifts to yellow, then to a light "cinnamon" brown, and then to a rich dark brown color. During roasting, oils appear on the surface of the bean. The roast will continue to darken until it is removed from the heat source.

Coffee can be roasted with ordinary kitchen equipment (frying pan, grill, oven, popcorn popper) or by specialised appliances. A coffee roaster is a special pan or apparatus suitable to heat up and roast green coffee beans.

Grinding [ edit ]

An old-fashioned manual burr-mill coffee grinder

Coffee grinder

The whole coffee beans are ground, also known as milling, to facilitate the brewing process.

The fineness of the grind strongly affects brewing. Brewing methods that expose coffee grounds to heated water for longer require a coarser grind than faster brewing methods. Beans that are too finely ground for the brewing method in which they are used will expose too much surface area to the heated water and produce a bitter, harsh, "over-extracted" taste. At the other extreme, an overly coarse grind will produce weak coffee unless more is used. Due to the importance of a grind's fineness, a uniform grind is highly desirable.

If a brewing method is used in which the time of exposure of the ground coffee to the heated water is adjustable, then a short brewing time can be used for finely ground coffee. This produces coffee of equal flavor yet uses less ground coffee. A blade grinder does not

<|begin_of_text|>Supply and demand is perhaps one of the most fundamental concepts of economics and it is the backbone of a market economy. Demand refers to how much (quantity) of a product or service is desired by buyers. The quantity demanded is the amount of a product people are willing to buy at a certain price; the relationship between price and quantity demanded is known as the demand relationship. Supply represents how much the market can offer. The quantity supplied refers to the amount of a certain good producers are willing to supply when receiving a certain price. The correlation between price and how much of a good or service is supplied to the market is known as the supply relationship. Price, therefore, is a reflection of supply and demand.

The relationship between demand and supply underlie the forces behind the allocation of resources. In market economy theories, demand and supply theory will allocate resources in the most efficient way possible. How? Let us take a closer look at the law of demand and the law of supply.

A. The Law of Demand

The law of demand states that, if all other factors remain equal, the higher the price of a good, the less people will demand that good. In other words, the higher the price, the lower the quantity demanded. The amount of a good that buyers purchase at a higher price is less because as the price of a good goes up, so does the opportunity cost of buying that good. As a result, people will naturally avoid buying a product that will force them to forgo the consumption of something else they value more. The chart below shows that the curve is a downward slope.

A, B and C are points on the demand curve. Each point on the curve reflects a direct correlation between quantity demanded (Q) and price (P). So, at point A, the quantity demanded will be Q1 and the price will be P1, and so on. The demand relationship curve illustrates the negative relationship between price and quantity demanded. The higher the price of a good the lower the quantity demanded (A), and the lower the price, the more the good will be in demand (C).

B. The Law of Supply

Like the law of demand, the law of supply demonstrates the quantities that will be sold at a certain price. But unlike the law of demand, the supply relationship shows an upward slope. This means that the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied. Producers supply more at a higher price because selling a higher quantity at a higher price increases revenue.

<|begin_of_text|>COLUMBUS, Ohio—Researchers at The Ohio State University have discovered how to control heat with a magnetic field.

In the March 23 issue of the journal Nature Materials, they describe how a magnetic field roughly the size of a medical MRI reduced the amount of heat flowing through a semiconductor by 12 percent.

The study is the first ever to prove that acoustic phonons—the elemental particles that transmit both heat and sound—have magnetic properties.

“This adds a new dimension to our understanding of acoustic waves,” said Joseph Heremans, Ohio Eminent Scholar in Nanotechnology and professor of mechanical engineering at Ohio State. “We’ve shown that we can steer heat magnetically. With a strong enough magnetic field, we should be able to steer sound waves, too.”

Joseph Heremans

People might be surprised enough to learn that heat and sound have anything to do with each other, much less that either can be controlled by magnets, Heremans acknowledged. But both are expressions of the same form of energy, quantum mechanically speaking. So any force that controls one should control the other.

“Essentially, heat is the vibration of atoms,” he explained. “Heat is conducted through materials by vibrations. The hotter a material is, the faster the atoms vibrate.

“Sound is the vibration of atoms, too,” he continued. “It’s through vibrations that I talk to you, because my vocal chords compress the air and create vibrations that travel to you, and you pick them up in your ears as sound.”

The name “phonon” sounds a lot like “photon.” That’s because researchers consider them to be cousins: Photons are particles of light, and phonons are particles of heat and sound. But researchers have studied photons intensely for a hundred years—ever since Einstein discovered the photoelectric effect. Phonons haven’t received as much attention, and so not as much is known about them beyond their properties of heat and sound.

Hyungyu Jin

This study shows that phonons have magnetic properties, too.

“We believe that these general properties are present in any solid,” said Hyungyu Jin, Ohio State postdoctoral researcher and lead author of the study.

The implication: In materials such as glass, stone, plastic—materials that are not conventionally magnetic—heat can be controlled magnetically, if you have a powerful enough magnet. The effect would go unnoticed in metals, which transmit so much heat via electrons that any heat carried by phonons is negligible by comparison.

There won’t be any practical applications of this discovery

<|begin_of_text|>Airglow (also called nightglow) is a faint emission of light by a planetary atmosphere. In the case of Earth's atmosphere, this optical phenomenon causes the night sky to never be completely dark, even after the effects of starlight and diffused sunlight from the far side are removed.

History [ edit ]

Airglow in Allier, France, on the night of 13 August 2015

The airglow phenomenon was first identified in 1868 by Swedish physicist Anders Ångström. Since then, it has been studied in the laboratory, and various chemical reactions have been observed to emit electromagnetic energy as part of the process. Scientists have identified some of those processes that would be present in Earth's atmosphere, and astronomers have verified that such emissions are present.

Description [ edit ]

Airglow is caused by various processes in the upper atmosphere of Earth, such as the recombination of atoms which were photoionized by the Sun during the day, luminescence caused by cosmic rays striking the upper atmosphere, and chemiluminescence caused mainly by oxygen and nitrogen reacting with hydroxyl free radicals at heights of a few hundred kilometres. It is not noticeable during the daytime due to the glare and scattering of sunlight.

Even at the best ground-based observatories, airglow limits the photosensitivity of optical telescopes. Partly for this reason, space telescopes like Hubble can observe much fainter objects than current ground-based telescopes at visible wavelengths.

Airglow at night may be bright enough for a ground observer to notice and appears generally bluish. Although airglow emission is fairly uniform across the atmosphere, it appears brightest at about 10° above the observer's horizon, since the lower one looks, the greater the depth of atmosphere one is looking through. Very low down, however, atmospheric extinction reduces the apparent brightness of the airglow.

One airglow mechanism is when an atom of nitrogen combines with an atom of oxygen to form a molecule of nitric oxide (NO). In the process, a photon is emitted. This photon may have any of several different wavelengths characteristic of nitric oxide molecules. The free atoms are available for this process, because molecules of nitrogen (N 2 ) and oxygen (O 2 ) are dissociated by solar energy in the upper reaches of the atmosphere and may encounter each other to form NO. Other species that can create air glow in the atmosphere are hydroxyl (OH),[2][3][4] atomic oxygen (O

The history of dance is difficult to access because dance does not often leave behind clearly identifiable physical artifacts that last over millennia, such as stone tools, hunting implements or cave paintings. It is not possible to identify with exact precision when dance became part of human culture.

Early dance [ edit ]

Dance has been an important part of ceremony, rituals, celebrations and entertainment since before the birth of the earliest human civilizations. Archaeology delivers traces of dance from prehistoric times such as the 30,000-year-old Bhimbetka rock shelters paintings in India and Egyptian tomb paintings depicting dancing figures from c. 3300 BC. Many contemporary dance forms can be traced back to historical, traditional, ceremonial, and ethnic dances of the ancient period.

Means of social communication and bonding [ edit ]

Dance may have been used as a tool of social interaction that promoted cooperation essential for survival among early humans. Studies found that today's best dancers share two specific genes associated with a predisposition for being good social communicators.[1]

As folk celebrations [ edit ]

Many dances of the early periods were performed to celebrate festivals, on important or seasonal occasions such as crop harvest, or births and weddings. Such dances are found all over the world.[2]

In ceremonies and rituals [ edit ]

Dance may be performed in religious or shamanic rituals, for example in rain dance performed in times of drought. Shamans dancing for rain is mentioned in ancient Chinese texts. Dance is an important aspect of some religious rites in ancient Egypt,[3] similarly dance is also integral to many ceremonies and rites among African people.[4] Ritual dances may also be performed in temples and during religious festivals, for example the Rasa ritual dances of India (a number of Indian classical dances may have their origin in ritual dances), and the Cham dances of Tibet.[5]

As a method of healing [ edit ]

Another early use of dance may have been as a precursor to ecstatic trance states in healing rituals. Dance is used for this purpose by many cultures from the Brazilian rainforest to the Kalahari Desert.[6] Medieval European danses macabres were thought to have protected participants from disease; however; the hysteria and duration of these dances sometimes led to death due to exhaustion.[7]

An international research team discovered the ice in crystalline form on the surface of comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko, Churi for short, indicating that it was formed 4.6 billion years ago — the results of the experiment have been published in the Astrophysical Journal.

The comet, which is part of the planet Jupiter family, has found to have ice crystals on its surface that could have originated in space before the solar system or the sun was formed in conditions described by scientists as protosolar nebula.

By analyzing chemicals trapped in the ice on the comet's surface, researchers were able to determine the age of the ice crystals using a mass spectrometer — which is an instrument that can measure the masses and relative concentrations of atoms and molecules. A statement from the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) said:

"If comets are made of crystalline ice, this means that they must have formed at the same time as the solar system, that than earlier in the interstellar medium."

Before Life Began

The discovery of ice crystals on Churi could have implications on future research surrounding how the earth and solar system began life.

<|begin_of_text|>Introduction

Following Algol, Scheme is a statically scoped programming language. Each use of a variable is associated with a lexically apparent binding of that variable.

Scheme has latent as opposed to manifest types. Types are associated with objects (also called values) rather than with variables. (Some authors refer to languages with latent types as untyped, weakly typed or dynamically typed languages.)

Other languages with latent types are Python, Ruby, Smalltalk, and other dialects of Lisp.

Languages with manifest types (sometimes referred to as strongly typed or statically typed languages) include Algol 60, C, C#, Java, Haskell, and ML.

Scheme was one of the first languages to support procedures as objects in their own right. Procedures can be created dynamically, stored in data structures, returned as results of procedures, and so on. Other languages with these properties include Common Lisp, Haskell, ML, Ruby, and Smalltalk.

One distinguishing feature of Scheme is that continuations - which in most other languages only operate behind the scenes - also have “first-class” status. First-class continuations are useful for implementing a wide variety of advanced control constructs, including non-local exits, backtracking, and coroutines.

In Scheme, the argument expressions of a procedure call are evaluated before the procedure gains control, whether the procedure needs the result of the evaluation or not.

C, C#, Common Lisp, Python, Ruby, and Smalltalk are other languages that always evaluate argument expressions before invoking a procedure.

This is distinct from the lazy-evaluation semantics of Haskell, or the call-by-name semantics of Algol 60, where an argument expression is not evaluated unless its value is needed by the procedure.

Basic types

Scheme programs manipulate objects, which are also referred to as values. Scheme objects are organized into sets of values called types. This section gives an overview of the fundamentally important types of the Scheme language. More types are described in later chapters.

As Scheme is latently typed, the use of the term type in this report differs from the use of the term in the context of other languages, particularly those with manifest typing.

<|begin_of_text|>The United States Transportation Security Administration has recently come under scrutiny for, among other things, its use of X-ray full-body scanners in airports to see through clothes and to detect non-metallic explosives. But are they safe? A group of UC-San Francisco professors recently raised a number of safety concerns regarding these scanners. While the Obama administration attempted to address these worries, its assertion that the scanners are safe appears to fall short.

The TSA has slowly been implementing the use of X-ray scanners in airports (so far, 38 airports have 206 of the machines) in order to see through passengers' clothes and check them for explosive devices. Officials have asserted that the machines are okay to use on the basis of the everyday use of X-rays in medical offices. However, a group of four UCSF professors pinpointed several important differences between the medical X-ray machines and those used in airports. They described the issues in a letter to Dr. John P. Holdren, the assistant to the president for science and technology.

A normal X-ray image is a familiar sight—depending on the exposure, an X-rayed person typically appears only as a skeleton. This is because the X-rays used in those machines penetrate the skin and can only scatter off of the larger atoms in bones.

Unlike a medical X-ray, the TSA X-ray machines are a sci-fi fan's dream: they are lower-energy beams that can only penetrate clothing and the topmost layers of skin. This provides TSA agents with a view that would expose any explosives concealed by clothing. But according to the UCSF professors, the low-energy rays do a "Compton scatter" off tissue layers just under the skin, rather than the bone, possibly exposing some vital areas and leaving the tissues at risk of mutation.

When an X-ray Compton scatters, it doesn't shift an electron to a higher energy level; instead, it hits the electron hard enough to dislodge it from its atom. The authors note that this process is "likely breaking bonds," which could cause mutations in cells and raise the risk of cancer.

Because the X-rays only make it just under the skin's surface, the total volume of tissue responsible for absorbing the radiation is fairly small. The professors point out that many body parts that are particularly susceptible to cancer are just under the surface, such as breast tissue and testicles. They are also concerned with those over 65, as well as children, being exposed to the X-rays.

The professors pointed to a number of other issues, including the possibility that TSA

American football teams and organizations subsequently adopted new rules which distinguished the game from rugby. [19] Among the most consequential changes was the adoption of the forward pass in 1906, which allowed the quarterback to throw the ball forward over the line of scrimmage to a receiver. [20] Canadian football remained akin to rugby for decades, though a progressive faction of players, chiefly based in the western provinces, demanded changes to the game based on the innovations in American football. Over the years, the sport adopted more Americanized rules, though it retained some of its historical features, including a 110-yard field, 12-player teams, and three downs instead of four. [3]

The sport developed from informal games played in North America during the 19th century. Early games had a variety of local rules and were generally similar to modern rugby union and soccer. By the 1860s, teams from universities were playing each other, leading to more standardized rules and the creation of college football. While several American schools adopted rules based on the soccer rules of the British Football Association, Harvard University held to its traditional "carrying game". Meanwhile, McGill University in Montreal used rules based on rugby union. In 1874, Harvard and McGill University in Montreal organized two games using each other's rules. Harvard took a liking to McGill's rugby-style rules, and subsequently played several other U.S. colleges over the next several years. [18]

The football used in North American football has a distinct pointed shape, with a brown color and prominent laces to aid in throwing

This is a minimal description of the game in general, with elements common to all or almost all variants of the game. For more specific rules, see each code's individual articles.

Prior to the start of a game, a coin toss determines which team will kick off the ball to their opponent. Each team lines up on opposite halves of the field, with a minimum ten yards of space between them for the kickoff. The team receiving the ball can make a fair catch (which stops the play immediately), catch the ball and run it back until the ball carrier is tackled, or, if the ball is kicked out of bounds, let the

<|begin_of_text|>Overview

One of the earliest shooting games, Space Invaders was released by Taito in Japan on June 19, 1978. Gameplay involves attempting to defeat waves of aliens cascading down from the top of the screen with a laser cannon that moves along a fixed horizontal axis. The only goal is to earn as many points as possible. Designer Tomohiro Nishikado was in charge of planning, graphic design, and programming for the game and drew creative inspiration from such diverse sources as Gun Fight, Breakout, The War of the Worlds, and Star Wars. The game’s development cycle lasted for one year, during which Nishikado created custom hardware and software. The game achieved massive popularity upon its release (leading to a temporary shortage of one hundred yen coins in Japan), and helped usher in the golden age of arcade video games (circa 1978-1984).

Space Invaders sold over 400,000 arcade cabinets worldwide and grossed around $3.8 billion in revenue by 1982, equivalent to over $13 billion in 2014, making it the highest-grossing video game of all time.

Gameplay

Arcade (cabaret/cocktail) version

Gameplay in Space Invaders is relatively simple. The player controls a small ship that can only move laterally across the bottom of the screen and fires vertically. Five rows of eleven aliens each advance slowly from one side of the screen to the other, dropping down one space and reversing direction when they reach either side. The player’s task is to acquire points by eliminating enemies and to destroy all of the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen and complete their “invasion.” As aliens are destroyed, the speed of the remaining enemies increases, as does the tempo of the music. Once all of the enemies are destroyed, the wave resets and the difficulty increases (a cycle that can continue indefinitely).

The Invaders constantly shoot back at the player as they advance from side to side across the screen. To help avoid their attacks, the player can hide behind a number of destructible barriers or “bunkers” near the bottom of the screen (four in the original version). Occasionally a “mystery ship” will appear near the top of the screen and move quickly from one side to the other while making a distinctive klaxon noise. Destroying it rewards the player with a sizeable point bonus.

<|begin_of_text|>Germany (German: Deutschland), officially the Federal Republic of Germany (German: Bundesrepublik Deutschland), is a country in Central Europe.

The first modern unified state in German history was the German Empire, founded in 1871 by Wilhelm I, King of Prussia. The country was a member of the Central Powers during World War I alongside Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire. However, as their war effort collapsed in 1918, the empire fell to civil conflicts, resulting in the abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II and the end of the German Empire. The Weimar Republic that succeeded the empire carried the burdens of the war in the years that followed.

Probably one of the most infamous eras of German history was the fascist Nazi regime of the Third Reich or Nazi Germany. In 1933, Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party came to power within the Weimar Republic, and soon seized all power from the democratic Reichstag. In the years that followed, Hitler built an enormous and zealous army and annexed neighboring countries, including Austria and Czechoslovakia. On September 1, 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland, prompting a declaration of war from France and the United Kingdom, sparking World War II.

<|begin_of_text|>IBM and Ogilvy make a big impact with the smallest of building blocks in their latest video, billed as "the world's smallest movie"—a rudimentary stop-motion animation made by IBM scientists using a special microscope they invented to move atoms around on a surface.

The movie, titled "A Boy and His Atom," consists of nearly 250 frames of stop-motion action and tells the simple story of a boy named Atom who dances and plays with an atom. By drawing viewers in with the film (a technological marvel that will no doubt be passed around far and wide), IBM then uses an engrossing behind-the-scenes clip to tell its larger story—about how the company has worked at the nanoscale for decades to explore the limits of data storage, among other things with real-world applications.

Andreas Heinrich, a principle investigator at IBM Research, is the most eloquent voice of the project. "Capturing, positioning and shaping atoms to create an original motion picture on the atomic level is a precise science and entirely novel," he says. "At IBM, researchers don't just read about science, we do it. This movie is a fun way to share the atomic-scale world and show everyday people the challenges and fun science can create."

The consequences of IBM's research at the atomic level are also put into useful context—using, fittingly enough, the movies as a gauge. Today's electronic devices need roughly 1 million atoms to store a single bit of data. But IBM researchers have shown that only 12 atoms are actually needed to store one bit. The implications for data storage are astonishing—it means that one day, every movie ever made could be stored in a device the size of a fingernail.

While IBM works on that, it hopes this movie accomplishes a simpler goal: getting kids to love science. As Heinrich says: "If I can do this by making a movie, and I can get a thousand kids to join science rather than go into law school, I'd be super happy."

This is ANOTHER meteor which exploded in the sky - just two hours before a space rock crash-landed in Russia injuring 1,000 people.

The fireball - reportedly followed by a loud explosion some minutes later - was spotted above Cuba at 1am GMT yesterday.

That's 6,000 miles away from Chelyabinsk where a meteor left a 20ft crater and caused a devastating sonic boom at 3.20am GMT.

China's Xinhua news agency reported the bright spot in the sky was spotted in the Cienfuegos area, in central Cuba.

One eyewitness said his house shook slightly in the blast and officials are scouring for any remnants of the object.

Some meteorites can be very valuable, selling for up to £433 per gram depending on their exact composition.

Scientists do not believe the space activity was linked to last night’s 150ft wide asteroid 2012 DA14, which passed within 17,000 miles last night.

The 10-tonne fireball in Russia entered the Earth’s atmosphere faster than the speed of sound.

It caused a devastating sonic boom that ripped through buildings and exploded windows, injuring 1,000 people including 82 children.

The immense pressure of the wave also tore the roof off a factory while some 170,000 square metres of shattered glass will need to be replaced.

Meteors are pieces of space rock, usually from larger comets or asteroids, that burn up on entering Earth’s atmosphere.

Bits that survive are called meteorites.

It is easy to see how this arrogance comes. The genius is a genius by the first look he casts on any object. Is his eye creative? Does he not rest in angles and colors, but beholds the design?- he will presently undervalue the actual object. In powerful moments, his thought has dissolved the works of art and nature into their causes, so that the works appear heavy and faulty. He has a conception of beauty which the sculptor cannot embody. Picture, statue, temple, railroad, steam-engine, existed first in an artist's mind, without flaw, mistake, or friction, which impair the executed models. So did the Church, the State, college, court, social circle, and all the institutions. It is not strange that these men, remembering what they have seen and hoped of ideas, should affirm disdainfully the superiority of ideas. Having at some time seen that the happy soul will carry all the arts in power, they say, Why cumber ourselves with superfluous realizations? and like dreaming beggars they assume to speak and act as if these values were already substantiated.

On the other part, the men of toil and trade and luxury,- the animal world, including the animal in the philosopher and poet also, and the practical world, including the painful drudgeries which are never excused to philosopher or poet any more than to the rest,- weigh heavily on the other side. The trade in our streets believes in no metaphysical causes, thinks nothing of the force which necessitated traders and a trading planet to exist: no, but sticks to cotton, sugar, wool and salt. The ward meetings, on election days, are not softened by any misgiving of the value of these ballotings. Hot life is streaming in a single direction. To the men of this world, to the animal strength and spirits, to the men of practical power, whilst immersed in it, the man of ideas appears out of his reason. They alone have reason.

Things always bring their own philosophy with them, that is, prudence. No man acquires property without acquiring with it a little arithmetic also. In England, the richest country that ever existed, property stands for more, compared with personal ability, than in any other. After dinner, a man believes less, denies more: verities have lost some charm. After dinner, arithmetic is the only science: ideas are disturbing, incendiary, follies of young men, repudiated by the solid portion of society

<|begin_of_text|>(OrganicJar) Hemp Seeds, are the most nutritionally complete food source in the world! Hemp has been eaten for thousands of years in different parts of the world. It's the seed that we eat, and it's beneficial in terms of protein and essential fatty acids. There's evidence that goes back thousands of years that it was beingeaten in China and in different places around the world for their health benefits.

Hemp seeds have an astonishing balanced nutritional make-up. It is one of the plant kingdom's most concentrated, complete and balanced sources of all 10 essential amino acids (EAA's) and essential fatty acids (EFA's) which are necessary to maintain healthy human life. You can divide it roughly into three components.

First: There are the essential fatty acids in the oil -- omega-6, omega-3, omega-9 -- and also minor fatty acids like gamma linolenic acid (GLA) and stearidonic acid, which is biosynthesized from the alpha-linolenic acid (ALA).

GLA and ALA cannot be made by the human body and must be obtained through the diet, so they are called essential fatty acids (EFA). GLA and ALA are the most important fatty acids in human nutrition and health. They are involved in producing life energy from food and the movement of that energy throughout the body. EFAs govern growth, vitality and state of mind. Still, much is unknown about their functioning in the body. This oil comprises 35% of the total seed weight and has the lowest amount of saturated fatty acids at 8%, and the highest amount of the polyunsaturated essential fatty acids at 80%. Flax seed oil comes in second at 72% combined total essential fatty acids.

Second: 35% consists mostly of fiber, both soluble and insoluble. Insoluble fiber possesses passive water-attracting properties that help to increase bulk, soften stool and shorten transit time through the intestinal tract. Soluble fiber undergoes metabolic processing via fermentation, yielding end-products with broad, significant health effects.

Thirdly: 25% consists of a complete and highly-digestible protein, 65% high-quality edestin protein, the most potent protein of any plant source, 35% albumin protein and glutamic acid. The globulin edestin in hemp seed closely resembles the globulin in blood plasma, and is compatible with the human digestive system. It is vital to the maintance of a healthy immune system and is also used

Aldous Huxley was one of the most iconic and prophetic thinkers of the 20st century.

Huxley is best-known for his novel Brave New World, in which he predicted the appearance of dictatorships which used soft forms of coercion such as drugs and entertainment to pacify the populace.

Later in life, Huxley became interested in psychedelic/entheogenic substances and mystical experiences, famously writing The Doors of Perception about his experiences with mescaline.

Beyond becoming one of the preeminent intellectuals of his time, Huxley also had a prodigious talent for writing.

His words contain a seemingly effortless eloquence. He’s one of those writers whose presence you can really feel in the sentences. You can almost picture Huxley, cross-legged and sipping a cup of tea, regaling you with his profound ideas over a lovely luncheon.

Keep that image in mind while you savor these quotes—these dusty treasures plucked from the consciousness of one of the most renowned geniuses ever to exist on this planet.

18 Rare Aldous Huxley Quotes

On the purpose of suffering and of art:

“Perhaps it’s good for one to suffer. Can an artist do anything if he’s happy? Would he ever want to do anything? What is art, after all, but a protest against the horrible inclemency of life?” ― Aldous Huxley, Antic Hay

On the causes of human misery:

“At least two thirds of our miseries spring from human stupidity, human malice, and those great motivators and justifiers of malice and stupidity: idealism, dogmatism and proselytizing zeal on behalf of religious or political idols.” — Aldous Huxley

On ordinary waking consciousness vs. mystical consciousness:

“The ordinary waking consciousness is a very useful and, on most occasions, an indispensable state of mind; but it is by no means the only form of consciousness, nor in all circumstances the best. Insofar as he transcends his ordinary self and his ordinary mode of awareness, the mystic is able to enlarge his vision, to look more deeply into the unfathomable miracle of existence.

This so-called interstellar material was spotted by NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX), a spacecraft that is studying the edge of the solar system from its orbit about 200,000 miles (322,000 kilometers) above Earth.

"This alien interstellar material is really the stuff that stars and planets and people are made of — it's really important to be measuring it," David McComas, IBEX principal investigator and assistant vice president of the Space Science and Engineering Division at Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, said in a news briefing from NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.

An international team of scientists presented new findings from IBEX, which included the first detection of alien particles of hydrogen, oxygen and neon, in addition to the confirmation of previously detected helium. [Images from NASA's IBEX Mission]

These atoms are remnants of older stars that have ended their lives in violent explosions, called supernovas, which dispersed the elements throughout the galaxy. As interstellar wind blows these charged and neutral particles through the Milky Way, the IBEX probe is able to create a census of the elements that are present.

Heavy elements in space

According to the new study, the researchers found 74 oxygen atoms for every 20 neon atoms in the interstellar wind. For comparison, there are 111 oxygen atoms for every 20 neon atoms in our solar system, meaning there are more oxygen atoms in any part of the solar system than in nearby interstellar space, the scientists said in a statement.

"These are important elements to know quantitatively because they are the building blocks of stars, planets, people," McComas said. "We discovered this puzzle: matter outside our solar system doesn't look like material inside our solar system. It seems to be deficient in oxygen compared to neon."

The presence of less oxygen within interstellar material could indicate that the sun formed in a region with less oxygen compared to its current location, the researchers said.

Or, it could be a sign that oxygen is "locked up" in other galactic materials, such as cosmic grains of dust or ice. [Top 10 Strangest Things in Space]

"That leaves us with a puzzle for now: could it be that some of that oxygen, which is so crucial for life on Earth, is locked up in the cosmic dust?" asked Eberhard Möbius, a professor at the University of New Hampshire and

"What interests me a lot is that the properties of this combined system depend sensitively on the relative alignment between them," he says.

Sanchez-Yamagishi, who received his PhD in January, is now a postdoc in Associate Professor Pablo Jarillo-Herrero's group. He assembles sandwiches of graphene and boron nitride with various horizontal orientations. "The tricks we would use were making cleaner devices, cooling them down to low temperatures and applying very large magnetic fields to them," says Sanchez-Yamagishi, who carried out measurements at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida. The lab features the largest continuous magnet in the world, 45 Tesla, which is about 10,000 times the strength of a refrigerator magnet.

Sanchez-Yamagishi was a lead co-author of a 2014 paper in Nature that showed that having a component of the applied magnetic field in the graphene plane forced electrons at the edge of graphene to move in opposite directions based on their spins. Lead co-authors were postdoc Benjamin M. Hunt and Pappalardo Fellow Andrea Young, both from MIT Physics Professor Raymond C. Ashoori's group. The paper was the culmination of two years' work, Sanchez-Yamagishi says.

"We were trying to realize some interesting quantum states in the graphene. It's called a quantum spin Hall state," Sanchez-Yamagishi explains. That would have applications in quantum computing, an area of interest to the group because Jarillo-Herrero is a researcher in the National Science Foundation-funded Center for Integrated Quantum Materials.

Sanchez-Yamagishi also was a co-author of a 2013 Science paper in which Jarillo-Herrero, Ashoori, and collaborators demonstrated that a certain alignment of layered graphene and hexagonal boron nitride created a unique bandgap in graphene, which could be a precursor to developing the material for functional transistors. Sanchez-Yamagishi's co-authors again included Young, now assistant professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara, and Hunt, who will join the faculty of the Carnegie Mellon physics department this fall.

They’re interested in a shell of electrons hundreds of kilometers overhead, which is responsible for heavenly light shows, GPS navigation and the continued existence of all earthly beings.

This part of the atmosphere, called the ionosphere, absorbs extreme ultraviolet radiation from the sun, protecting life on the ground from its harmful effects. “The ionosphere is the reason life exists on this planet,” says physicist Joshua Semeter of Boston University.

It’s also the stage for brilliant displays like the aurora borealis, which appears when charged material in interplanetary space skims the atmosphere. And the ionosphere is important for the accuracy of GPS signals and radio communication.

This layer of the atmosphere forms when radiation from the sun strips electrons from, or ionizes, atoms and molecules in the atmosphere between about 75 and 1,000 kilometers above Earth’s surface. That leaves a zone full of free-floating negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions, which warps and wefts signals passing through it.

Story continues below video

CURTAIN OF LIGHT The ionosphere, a layer in the Earth’s atmosphere that reacts strongly to solar activity, gives off a red-green glow when solar rays strike it and strip electrons off of atoms. This video shows this airglow as seen from the International Space Station. NASA Goddard

Without direct sunlight, though, the ionosphere stops ionizing. Electrons start to rejoin the atoms and molecules they abandoned, neutralizing the atmosphere’s charge. With fewer free electrons bouncing around, the ionosphere reflects radio waves differently, like a distorted mirror.

We know roughly how this happens, but not precisely. The eclipse will give researchers a chance to examine the charging and uncharging process in almost real time.

“The eclipse lets us look at the change from light to dark to light again very quickly,” says Jill Nelson of George Mason University in Fairfax, Va.

Joseph Huba and Douglas Drob of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., predicted some of what should happen to the ionosphere in the July 17 Geophysical Research Letters. At higher altitudes, the electrons’ temperature should decrease by 15 percent. Between 150 and 350 kilometers above Earth’s surface, the density of free-floating electrons should drop by a factor of two as they rejoin atoms, the researchers say. This drop in free-floating electrons

The new video reveals changes in Saturn's aurora every few minutes, in high resolution, with three dimensions. The images show a previously unseen vertical profile to the auroras, which ripple in the video like tall curtains. These curtains reach more than 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) above the edge of the planet's northern hemisphere.

The new video and still images are online at: http://www.nasa.gov/cassini, http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov and http://ciclops.org.

Auroras occur on Earth, Jupiter, Saturn and a few other planets, and the new images will help scientists better understand how they are generated.

"The auroras have put on a dazzling show, shape-shifting rapidly and exposing curtains that we suspected were there, but hadn't seen on Saturn before," said Andrew Ingersoll of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, who is a member of the Cassini imaging team that processed the new video. "Seeing these things on another planet helps us understand them a little better when we see them on Earth."

Auroras appear mostly in the high latitudes near a planet's magnetic poles. When charged particles from the magnetosphere -- the magnetic bubble surrounding a planet -- plunge into the planet's upper atmosphere, they cause the atmosphere to glow. The curtain shapes show the paths that these charged particles take as they flow along the lines of the magnetic field between the magnetosphere and the uppermost part of the atmosphere.

The height of the curtains on Saturn exposes a key difference between Saturn's atmosphere and our own, Ingersoll said. While Earth's atmosphere has a lot of oxygen and nitrogen, Saturn's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen. Because hydrogen is very light, the atmosphere and auroras reach far out from Saturn. Earth's auroras tend to flare only about 100 to 500 kilometers (60 to 300 miles) above the surface.

The speed of the auroral changes in the video is comparable to some of those on Earth, but scientists are still working to understand the processes that produce these rapid changes. The height will also help them learn how much energy is required to light up auroras.

"I was wowed when I saw these images and the curtain," said Tamas Gombosi of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who

Widely distributed parts of the sensory nervous system

The somatosensory system is a part of the sensory nervous system. The somatosensory system is a complex system of sensory neurons and pathways that responds to changes at the surface or inside the body. The axons (as afferent nerve fibers) of sensory neurons connect with, or respond to, various receptor cells. These sensory receptor cells are activated by different stimuli such as heat and nociception, giving a functional name to the responding sensory neuron, such as a thermoreceptor which carries information about temperature changes. Other types include mechanoreceptors, chemoreceptors, and nociceptors which send signals along a sensory nerve to the spinal cord where they may be processed by other sensory neurons and then relayed to the brain for further processing. Sensory receptors are found all over the body including the skin, epithelial tissues, muscles, bones and joints, internal organs, and the cardiovascular system.

Touch is a crucial means of receiving information. This photo shows tactile markings identifying stairs for visually impaired people.

Somatic senses are sometimes referred to as somesthetic senses,[1] with the understanding that somesthesis includes the sense of touch, proprioception (sense of position and movement), and (depending on usage) haptic perception.[2]

The mapping of the body surfaces in the brain is called somatotopy. In the cortex, it is also referred to as the cortical homunculus. This brain-surface ("cortical") map is not immutable, however. Dramatic shifts can occur in response to stroke or injury.

System overview [ edit ]

This diagram linearly (unless otherwise mentioned) tracks the projections of all known structures that allow for touch to their relevant endpoints in the human brain.

Mechanical [ edit ]

The four mechanoreceptors in the skin each respond to different stimuli for short or long periods.

Merkel cell nerve endings are found in the basal epidermis and hair follicles; they react to low vibrations (5–15 Hz) and deep static touch such as shapes and edges. Due to having a small receptive field (extremely detailed info), they are used in areas like fingertips the most; they are not covered (shelled) and thus respond to pressures over long periods.

Tactile corpuscles react to moderate vibration (10–50 Hz) and light touch. They are located in the dermal papillae

Being inducted into the Dubai Taxi fleet, the new hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle has only water emissions. It is noiseless and can travel 500 km on a full tank, and refilling it takes not more than five minutes.

The emission-free Toyota Mirai is powered by hydrogen, which generates electricity inside the engine after being mixed with oxygen supplied through the grill intake at the front of the vehicle.

The vehicle is characterised by high-level driving convenience and uses Toyota Fuel Cell System (TFCS), that combines the fuel-cell technology and the hybrid technology. It contains a fuel-cell stack and a high-pressure hydrogen tank.

"RTA attaches paramount importance to protecting the environment and saving power consumption, and safety and environmental sustainability is its strategic goal," remarked Mattar Al Tayer, the director-general and chairman of the board of executive directors.

"We have announced a plan to convert 50 per cent of Dubai Taxicabs into hybrid vehicles by 2021," he noted.

"The plan involves raising the number of hybrid taxis in Dubai from 791 in 2016 to 4,750 in 2021. The Dubai Taxi Corporation accounts for the largest share of hybrid vehicles (2,280 vehicles), and the number of hybrid vehicles currently accounts for 20 per cent of the fleet," he added.

Expressing his delight at the DTC becoming the first taxi operator in the Middle East to deploy a hydrogen fuel-cell electric vehicle (Mirai) in its fleet, Al Tayer said: "RTA will start a trial run of the vehicle as part of its limousine service in the Dubai International Airport to assess the economic feasibility and environmental benefits of its operation besides verifying the efficiency of the engine, maintenance cost and other parameters."

According to him, RTA was the first entity in the region to start the trial run of hybrid (fuel and electricity) vehicles as part of its taxi fleet from 2008 to 2011.

"Results have proved the economic and environmental feasibility of the experiment by saving fuel consumption by 30 per cent and reducing carbon emission by 30 per cent as well," he added.-TradeArabia News Service<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

The meme-based digital coins were originally created as a joke counter currency to Bitcoin but have since become at least mildly legitimate and, apparently, quite hackable. While each Dogecoin is only worth £0.00035 (compared to Bitcoin's £445 at the time of writing), the 30 million stolen have been estimated to add up to about £7,000, and investors over at the Dogecoin forums have been dismayed to find that investing in a currency created "without much real thought" has lost them actual money. Whoulda thunk.

One investor complained:

I used dogewallet to give doges to my parents as a christmas gift. I really cannot afford to replace them.

After users began reporting losing up to one million coins at a time, Dogewallet's creators brought down the site and posted the following explanation in the Doges.org forums:

We found many reports of Dogewallet transactions being sent to 'DQT9WcqmUyyccrxQvSrjcFCqRxt8eVBLx8'. We're currently looking at logs and have found thousands of attempts to hack our systems. Specifically, the attack originated from the hacker gaining access to our filesystem and modifying the send/receive page to send to a static address. We're currently reviewing logs for information.

These are the 5 days when the Moon’s orbit crosses Earth’s magnetotail, the vast region of the planet’s magnetosphere that gets swept back by solar wind. Within the magnetotail is a structure called the plasma sheet, a layer with a weaker magnetic field that’s relatively thick with ions.

“Our new finding suggests that the Earth-Moon system coevolves not only physically but also chemically.” Now results from Japan’s Selenological and Engineering Explorer (SELENE) lunar orbiter show that during this time when the Moon passes through Earth’s plasma sheet, significant amounts of terrestrial oxygen from Earth rain down onto the Moon’s surface. This has likely been going on since oxygen became abundant in Earth’s atmosphere some 3 billion years ago.

“Our new finding suggests that the Earth-Moon system coevolves not only physically but also chemically,” said Kentaro Terada, lead author on the study and planetary scientist at Osaka University in Japan. The research, published today in Nature Astronomy, hints that someday Moon dust could help scientists study Earth’s ancient atmosphere.

Solar Versus Terrestrial Oxygen

Solar wind, the collective stream of highly energetic particles that hurtle from the Sun, constantly batters Earth’s magnetosphere, shaping it into its characteristic teardrop form. Behind Earth, the magnetotail extends more than 600,000 kilometers.

While Earth gets buffeted by solar wind, some particles—including hydrogen and oxygen ions stripped of electrons—escape along Earth’s magnetic field lines into the plasma sheet. For a brief period during every lunar orbit, the Moon passes through the plasma sheet, where it’s exposed to these ionized particles of terrestrial origin.

But do these particles—in particular, oxygen ions—make it to the lunar surface, and if so, how would we know? Thus far, it’s been “an enigma,” Terada said. After all, oxygen carried on the solar wind also arrives at the Moon after it orbits out of Earth’s magnetotail.

Researchers decided to look at data from SELENE, nicknamed Kaguya, to see if they could pick up signs of terrestrial oxygen in the days when the Moon passed through Earth’s magnetotail. Data from Kayuga, which stopped collecting observations in 2010, revealed that during a few hours every month

The microwave oven has been a mainstay in the US for 30+ years, virtually transforming society and how we view food. But despite its wonders, the question that’s been avoided remains: are microwaves the healthiest cooking option? The answer is, of course, no, as there are much better options available that will ensure nutrients will remain in your food.

How Does Microwaving Work?

Before we dive into the research on the possible effects and safety of microwave ovens, let’s clarify what a microwave is. A microwave is a form of non-ionizing radiation. As a matter of contrast, ionizing radiation changes the electromagnetic nature of atoms, or ionizes them. This alters the way they interact with other atoms and molecules around them. X-rays, gamma radiation, and nuclear medicine (CT scans, barium swallows, and mammograms) are types of ionizing radiation. Your food is being zapped by high-frequency waves of heat, and some people argue that this radiation can be harmful to your health.

One study by Dr. Hans Hertel explored how microwaves change the molecular structure of food and the effects of that food on the human body. In his study, he found that individuals who consumed the microwaved foods experienced a decrease in HDL cholesterol, a reduced red blood cell count, and fewer white blood cells. Unfortunately, no studies have been conducted since to replicate Dr. Hertel's findings, so it would be reaching to conclude that microwaving does indeed deteriorate health. Still, there are other cooking options that may be far better at retaining the nutritive quality of food.

The Best Cooking Options for Maintaining Nutrition

Microwaving cooks the food at very high temperatures in a very short amount of time. This results in a great deal of nutrient loss for most foods, especially vegetables. Our foods are also subjected to nutrient loss when we boil, fry, or roast our food. Boiling vegetables, for example, leeches most of the nutrients (including antioxidants) into the water. The best option for cooking vegetables that will result in only a minor loss of nutrients is steaming. Sautéing and baking at low temperatures is also a viable option that will retain more nutrients than microwaving, boiling, or frying. Of course, by making the majority of your diet raw, with some added dietary fat to help absorb the fat-soluble vitamins (A, D,

Now, a significant obstacle to the development of next-generation device technologies appears to have been overcome, according to researchers from the University of Tokyo (Japan), Tokyo Institute of Technology (Japan) and Ho Chi Minh University of Pedagogy (Vietnam).

Specializing in the emerging field of semiconductor spintronics, the team has become the first to report growing iron-doped ferromagnetic semiconductors working at room temperature -- a longstanding physical constraint. Doping is the practice of adding atoms of impurities to a semiconductor lattice to modify electrical structure and properties. Ferromagnetic semiconductors are valued for their potential to enhance device functionality by utilizing the spin degrees of freedom of electrons in semiconductor devices.

"Bridging semiconductor and magnetism is desirable because it would provide new opportunities of utilizing spin degrees of freedom in semiconductor devices," explained research leader Masaaki Tanaka, Ph.D., of the Department of Electrical Engineering & Information Systems, and Center for Spintronics Research Network, University of Tokyo. "Our approach is, in fact, against the traditional views of material design for ferromagnetic semiconductors. In our work, we have made a breakthrough by growing an iron-doped semiconductor which shows ferromagnetism up to room temperature for the first time in semiconductors that have good compatibility with modern electronics. Our results open a way to realize semiconductor spintronic devices operating at room temperature."

The researchers discuss their findings this week in Applied Physics Letters, from AIP Publishing. The researchers' maverick move challenged the prevailing theory that predicted a type of semiconductor known as "wide band gap" would be strongly ferromagnetic. Most research focuses on the wide band gap approach. "We instead chose narrow-gap semiconductors, such as indium arsenide, or gallium antimonide, as the host semiconductors," Tanaka said. This choice enabled them to obtain ferromagnetism and conserve it at room temperature by adjusting doping concentrations.

Investigators have long envisioned bridging semiconductors and magnetism to create new opportunities of utilizing spin degrees of freedom and harnessing electron spin in semiconductors. But until now, ferromagnetic semiconductors have only worked under experimental conditions at extremely low, cold temperatures, typically lower than 200 K (-73oC), which is much colder than the freezing

A step closer to affordable water desalination

The defence contractor, Lockheed Martin, has reported a new method for desalination that is vastly cheaper and more efficient, using nanotechnology.

Lockheed Martin has been awarded a patent for "Perforene" – a new molecular filtration system that is designed to meet the growing global demand for potable water. This material works by removing sodium, chlorine and other ions from seawater and other sources.

Dr. Ray Johnson, senior vice president and chief technology officer: "Access to clean drinking water is going to become more critical as the global population continues to grow, and we believe that this simple and affordable solution will be a game-changer for the industry. Perforene... is just one example of Lockheed Martin's efforts to apply some of the advanced materials that we have developed for our core markets, including aircraft and spacecraft, to global environmental and economic challenges."

According to a UN report last year, over 780 million people around the world do not have access to clean drinking water. Tom Notaro, Lockheed business manager for advanced materials: "One of the areas that we're very concerned about in terms of global security is the access to clean and affordable drinking water. As more and more countries become more developed... access to that water for their daily lives is becoming more and more critical."

Perforene was developed by placing holes that are one nanometre or less in a membrane of graphene. These are small enough to trap ions while dramatically improving the flow-through of water molecules, reducing clogging and pressure. Being just one atom thick, graphene is both strong and durable, making it far more effective at sea water desalination at a fraction of the cost of traditional reverse osmosis systems.

John Stetson, senior engineer: "It's 500 times thinner than the best filter on the market today and 1,000 times stronger. The energy that's required and the pressure that's required to filter salt is approximately 100 times less."

In addition to desalination, the Perforene membrane can be tailored to other applications – including capturing minerals, through the selection of the size of hole placed in the material to filter or capture a specific size particle of interest. Lockheed Martin has also been developing processes that will allow the material to be produced at scale. The company is now seeking commercialisation partners.

From Stanley Kubrick: Interviews (public library) comes this layered meditation on purpose, mortality, and, as Carl Jung once put it, the art of “kindl[ing] a light in the darkness of mere being,” from a 1968 Playboy interview by Eric Nordern:

Playboy: Thanks to those special effects, 2001 is undoubtedly the most graphic depiction of space flight in the history of films — and yet you have admitted that you yourself refuse to fly, even in a commercial jet liner. Why?

Kubrick: I suppose it comes down to a rather awesome awareness of mortality. Our ability, unlike the other animals, to conceptualize our own end creates tremendous psychic strains within us; whether we like to admit it or not, in each man’s chest a tiny ferret of fear at this ultimate knowledge gnaws away at his ego and his sense of purpose. We’re fortunate, in a way, that our body, and the fulfillment of its needs and functions, plays such an imperative role in our lives; this physical shell creates a buffer between us and the mind-paralyzing realization that only a few years of existence separate birth from death. If man really sat back and thought about his impending termination, and his terrifying insignificance and aloneness in the cosmos, he would surely go mad, or succumb to a numbing sense of futility. Why, he might ask himself, should he bother to write a great symphony, or strive to make a living, or even to love another, when he is no more than a momentary microbe on a dust mote whirling through the unimaginable immensity of space?

Those of us who are forced by their own sensibilities to view their lives in this perspective — who recognize that there is no purpose they can comprehend and that amidst a countless myriad of stars their existence goes unknown and unchronicled — can fall prey all too easily to the ultimate anomie….But even for those who lack the sensitivity to more than vaguely comprehend their transience and their triviality, this inchoate awareness robs life of meaning and purpose; it’s why ‘the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation,’ why so many

Explanation: Perhaps the original spiral nebula, M51 is a large galaxy, over 60,000 light-years across, with a readily apparent spiral structure. Also cataloged as NGC 5194, M51 is a part of a well-known interacting galaxy pair, its spiral arms and dust lanes clearly sweeping in front of companion galaxy NGC 5195 (top). This dramatically processed color composite combines M51 image data from the Calar Alto Observatory's 1.2 meter telescope.

Fish, reptiles, and even some invertebrates appear to play. But when is it play, and not something else? And why do animals do it?

During a visit to the National Zoo in Washington, DC, biopsychologist Gordon Burghardt decided to peek in on a Nile soft-shelled turtle its keepers affectionately called “Pigface.” Pigface had been a zoo resident for more than 50 years, and Burghardt had seen him before, but this time, he noticed something a bit curious—Pigface was playing basketball.

“It was by itself,” recalls Burghardt, currently at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, and “it had started to knock around” a basketball provided by its keepers. The year was 1994, and play had only rarely and anecdotally been reported in animals other than mammals, but he thought that might be what Pigface was doing. The 1-meter-long turtle exuberantly pushed the ball around its aquatic enclosure, swimming through the water with ease as it batted the ball in front of it with its nose. “If you saw a dog or an otter going around batting a ball, bouncing around and chasing it, and going back and forth and doing it over and over again, we’d have no problem calling it play,” he says. “And that’s what the turtle was doing.”

More recently, ethologist Jennifer Mather of the University of Lethbridge in Canada learned that two of her octopus research subjects had repeatedly blown jet streams of water at floating empty pill bottles, shooting them across the surface of their tanks at the Seattle Aquarium. “If you give an [octopus] something new, it will grab it in its arms and bring it up to its mouth, probably exploring it chemically,” she says. This would usually happen a couple of times, she adds, until it “knew what it was, and didn’t bother anymore. But these two, it’s like they suddenly thought, ‘Maybe I can do something with this.’ ”

For Burghardt and Mather and most researchers who have witnessed such bizarre activities in reptiles, fish, and even invertebrates, it is clear that these animals engage in some form of play. But not everyone is convinced. “I personally doubt it,” says behavioral physiologist Bernd Heinrich of the University of Vermont. “I personally have never seen anything I’d call ‘play’ in turtles and was

I know they told me not to go straight there, but I didn't feel like having to navigate this dump when it started getting really hot. I couldn't really bolt without shaking the toaster on my arm loose anyway, so the reasons to beeline outweighed those not to.

The walk gave me some time to think. My mind immediately turned to shower thoughts about the area. How many ponies were living in the San Cimarron area? Surely a desert settlement would have serious challenges with water, particularly considering that in a post-balefire landscape, there wouldn't be many living cacti. The Rangers probably had stuff like condensers and the tools for drilling down to the water table, the Enclave could have clouds shipped in or something, and Los Arabos had the ability to strip hydrogen and oxygen straight from rocks or something for all I knew. But the local settlements would have some real problems.

After a half-built housing project, the shell of a community college, another U-235, and an ostentatious glass-roofed shopping mall that looked like it was in decline even before the world ended, my thoughts had ended up on, like, how pretty much any music you can think of can be improved by the addition of a brass section. Don't ask me how I got there from plumbing logistics, I haven't a fucking clue. Point is, this is the part where I started... what is it. Humming? Scatting?

I stanced wide and looked around. The noise faded back to nothing. Not even a gust of wind or a creak of crappy old buildings. I checked my map.

Recent studies of Au-Pt nanoporous metal actuators have revealed exceptionally high strains15, but such high strains were achieved at relatively low frequencies (0.00025 Hz) and such actuator materials are expensive. The use of abundant materials such as metallic NiOOH and V 2 O 5 fibres can mitigate the cost of metallic actuators17,18, though the performance of these particular actuators depends on the crystallographic orientation of the material. See Extended Data Table 1 for a literature survey of actuator performance.

In this study, we report a macroscopic actuation device, the mechanism of which is the electrochemically induced insertion and removal of cations between two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets of 1T MoS 2 (see Extended Data Fig. 1; applied voltage from +0.3 V to -0.3 V is required for removal and insertion of cations). Two-dimensional materials such as MoS 2 nanosheets have high surface to volume ratios, enabling large amounts of electrochemical charge storage. The stored electrochemical charge—which affects the interatomic bonds and the distance between atoms via double-layer formation1,19, ion intercalation11 or Faradaic reaction17—reconfigures the space-charge region in the vicinity of the electrode–electrolyte interface. The use of this sort of intercalation mechanism to induce expansion has previously been demonstrated in graphite battery electrodes; under a pre-stress loading of 10 MPa, strain and energy density values of 6.7% and 670 kJ m−3, respectively, were achieved in electrochemical cells comprising LiCoO 2 cathodes and bulk micromachined highly oriented pyrolytic graphite anodes. Expansion occurred because of synergistic expansion of both the cathode and the anode during delithiation and lithiation, respectively11, giving an energy density of 1.3 MJ m−3 and strain values of 1.8% under 100 MPa applied load, along with strains of 1% at frequencies of 6.7 mHz under 2 MPa loading in a fully packaged 740

“Why is there clouds?”

“So it can rain.”

“Why is there rain?”

“Because all these plants are thirsty.”

“But why are they thirsty?”

Etcetera. The why never stopped.

I would have done better with how – I had a thing for science at the time. But even so, science runs out of answers, because it has turned its back on the most fundamental of all forces.

Consciousness.

Science is like a boy trying to light a fire. Up until mid-nineteenth century the boy had only one piece of kindling – the fundamental force of gravity. Then the boy found the electromagnetic force, and after that the strong and weak nuclear forces. Four pieces. So, science improved its ability to describe how the fire (the universe) should work.

But still no fire. It’s missing something. The world’s most famous living physicist, Stephen Hawking agrees. He says, “What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe?”

It’s consciousness.

Consciousness is the breath that generates the four fundamental forces and every object in the universe. All humans, animals, birds, plants, minerals and even the air molecules that passes through your lungs are a projection of consciousness and have their own levels of awareness.

Consciousness is the breath that maintains the shape of your body, taking in elements of the earth to make new cells, replace the old and returning their elements to the earth. You replace your entire body at least once every two years, until you lay it down and move on.

Consciousness is the breath science must use if it wants to throw a full light on the universe. So far it has refused, because the great drama of consciousness is subjective. But then the whole universe is literally a subjective experience. There is no objective universe to discover.

When science folds consciousness into its view of the universe, it will grow. It will know the why of existence as well as the how. Then – maybe – it will tackle the Five Universal Truths of existence.

Standard English (SE, also standardized English) is the dialect of English language that is used as the national norm—the standard language—in an English-speaking country, especially as the language for public and formal usage.[1] In England and Wales, the term standard English is associated with British English, the Received Pronunciation accent, and the United Kingdom Standard English (UKSE) grammar and vocabulary. In Scotland, the standard dialect is Scottish Standard English; in the United States, General American is the standard variety spoken in that country; and in Australia, the national standard is called General Australian English.[2]

Definitions [ edit ]

Although a standard English is generally the most formal version of the language, a range of registers exists within any standardized English, as is often seen when comparing a newspaper article with an academic paper, for example. A distinction also may be drawn between spoken and written usage. Spoken dialects are looser than their written counterparts, and quicker to accept new grammatical forms and vocabulary. The various geographical varieties form a generally accepted set of rules, often those established by grammarians of the 18th century.[3]

English originated in England during the Anglo-Saxon period, and is now spoken as a first or second language in many countries of the world, many of which have developed one or more "national standards" (though this does not refer to published standards documents, but to frequency of consistent usage). English is the first language of the majority of the population in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, the Bahamas and Barbados and is an official language in many others, including; India, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Africa and Nigeria.

As the result of colonisation and historical migrations of English-speaking populations, and the predominant use of English as the international language of trade and commerce (a lingua franca), English has also become the most widely used second language.[4] In countries where English is neither a native language nor widely spoken, a non-native variant (typically English English or North American English) might be considered "standard" for teaching purposes.[5] In some areas a pidgin or creole language, blends English with one or more native languages.

Grammar [ edit ]

Although the standard Englishes of the various anglophone countries are very similar, often there are minor grammatical differences between them, as well as numerous vocabulary divergences. In American and Australian

by Staff Writers

Cleveland OH (SPX) May 29, 2013

Entanglement is a property in quantum mechanics that seemed so unbelievable and so lacking in detail that, 66 years ago this spring, Einstein called it "spooky action at a distance."

But a mathematician at Case Western Reserve University and two of his recent PhD graduates show entanglement is actually prevalent in large quantum systems and have identified the threshold at which it occurs.

The finding holds promise for the ongoing push to understand and take advantage of the property. If harnessed, entanglement could yield super high-speed communications, hack-proof encryptions and quantum computers so fast and powerful they would make today's supercomputers look like adding machines in comparison.

The mathematicians don't tell us how entanglement works, but were able to put parameters on the property by combining math concepts developed for a number of different applications during the last five decades. In a nutshell, the researchers connected the math to properties of quantum mechanics-the otherworldly rules that best apply to atomic and subatomic particles-to describe physical reality.

"There have been indications that large subgroups within quantum systems are entangled," said Stanislaw Szarek, mathematics professor at Case Western Reserve and an author of the study. "Our contribution is to find out exactly when entanglement becomes ubiquitous."

Szarek worked with Guillaume Aubrun, assistant professor of mathematics at Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, France, and Deping Ye, assistant professor of mathematics and statistics at Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada. Their work is published online in the Early View section of Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics.

The behaviors of materials down at the level of atoms are often strange, but entanglement borders on our concepts of sorcery. For example, if two electrons spinning in opposite directions are entangled, when one changes direction, the other immediately changes, whether the electrons are side by side, across the room or at opposite ends of the universe.

Other particles, such as photons, atoms and molecules, can also become entangled, but taking advantage of the property requires more than a pair or handful.

Szarek, Aubrun and Ye focused on large quantum systems-large groups of particles that have the potential for use in our world.

They found that, in systems in a random state, two subsystems that are each less than one-fifth of the whole are generally not entangled. Two

(CNN) Recently, Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham predictably but mistakenly called for greater United States military involvement in the Syrian civil war, proving they have learned nothing from our history in the Middle East.

It seems that every dictator and every atrocity in that region is met with a call for action without a thought to consequences. Those who wish to send our soldiers to "take care" of every atrocity in the world might want to take a glance at Maplecroft's Human Rights Risk Atlas, which currently lists 35 countries as extreme risks for committing atrocities. Are we prepared to send our military to right the wrongs of all 35 countries?

Of course, Americans were horrified by the use of chemical weapons in Syria on innocent people. But there are horrors all around the world, and surely the suggestion is not that we battle them all.

United States military action is not to be taken lightly. It should be thoughtful, measured, constitutional -- and decisive for a victory. For over two decades, we have acted as a traffic cop in the Middle East -- sanctions, bombings, no-fly zones, invasions, occupations, policing, nation-building.

American foreign policy now requires a dramatic shift. It must be governed by the question: What are our vital national security interests in the region?

President Trump was elected in no small measure because he castigated the previous administration for the disastrous and destabilizing Iraq War. He lampooned the Obama/Clinton decision to bomb Libya and send it into chaos. And Trump warned, rightfully, that Syria was a quagmire, ripe with opportunities for mistakes and catastrophic consequences to world peace.

For years, I have argued against intervention in the Syrian civil war, and I have done so under both Democrat and Republican presidents.

It isn't that there aren't atrocities. There are -- and on both sides of the war. But sometimes discerning the good guys from the bad is not possible. Sometimes, there is no good side in war.

<|begin_of_text|>European scientists are currently trying to collect enough antimatter to determine if the elusive substance reacts to gravity in the opposite way that normal matter doesby "falling up" instead of down.

Anti-gravity has long been a staple of science fiction as a future technological means for propelling spacecraft away from massive objects like planets and stars? But does it really exist in nature?

Scientists working on the Antihydrogen Laser Physics Apparatus (Alpha) experiment at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Switzerland aim to find out, according to reports. They theorize that antimatter, made up of antiparticles which possess an opposite electrical charge and quantum spin to normal particles, could also be repelled by ordinary matter instead of being attracted to it.

Writing in the latest issue of Nature Communications, the Alpha experiment scientists from the LHCb team note that "there are many indirect indications that no such differences exist" in how matter and antimatter interacts with gravity. But they also suggest that the new wealth of data the experiment has collected on antihydrogen particles is worth looking through to check if anti-gravity does exist, while proposing a way to do that.

"[T]here have been no direct, free-fall style, experimental tests of gravity on antimatter. Here we describe a novel direct test methodology; we search for a propensity for antihydrogen atoms to fall downward when released from the Alpha antihydrogen trap. In the absence of systematic errors, we can reject ratios of the gravitational to inertial mass of antihydrogen >75 at a statistical significance level of 5 percent; worst-case systematic errors increase the minimum rejection ratio to 110. A similar search places somewhat tighter bounds on a negative gravitational mass, that is, on antigravity. This methodology, coupled with ongoing experimental improvements, should allow us to bound the ratio within the more interesting near equivalence regime," the researchers write.

The LHCb research team is now prying into other mysteries of antimatter such as the rates at which exotic particles decay into either matter or antimatter, according to BBC News. Scientists last week were able to determine "a slight difference in the decay of particles called Bs mesons," BBC News reported.

But one big hurdle in this research is that producing antiparticles is difficultand keeping them around for any length of time is even tougher.

The universe contains plenty of normal matter but just trace amounts of antimatter. When normal particles and antiparticles collide they destroy each other

<|begin_of_text|>Several fundamental ideas in calculus are more than 2000 years old. As a formal subdiscipline of mathematics, calculus was first introduced and developed in the late 1600s, with key independent contributions from Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Mathematicians agree that the subject has been understood rigorously since the work of Augustin Louis Cauchy and Karl Weierstrass in the mid 1800s when the field of modern analysis was developed, in part to make sense of the infinitely small quantities on which calculus rests. Hence, as a body of knowledge calculus has been completely understood by experts for at least 150 years. The discipline is one of our great human intellectual achievements: among many spectacular ideas, calculus models how objects fall under the forces of gravity and wind resistance, explains how to compute areas and volumes of interesting shapes, enables us to work rigorously with infinitely small and infinitely large quantities, and connects the varying rates at which quantities change to the total change in the quantities themselves.While each author of a calculus textbook certainly offers her own creative perspective on the subject, it is hardly the case that many of the ideas she presents are new. Indeed, the mathematics community broadly agrees on what the main ideas of calculus are, as well as their justification and their importance; the core parts of nearly all calculus textbooks are very similar. As such, it is our opinion that in the 21st century – an age where the internet permits seamless and immediate transmission of information – no one should be required to purchase a calculus text to read, to use for a class, or to find a coherent collection of problems to solve. Calculus belongs to humankind, not any individual author or publishing company. Thus, the main purpose of this work is to present a new calculus text that is free. In addition, instructors who are looking for a calculus text should have the opportunity to download the source files and make modifications that they see fit; thus this text is open-source.

Malnutrition is a condition resulting from a dietary deficiency, such as a lack of access to a specific nutrient or due to a lack of access to food in general.

Undernourishment is simply when people consume too little food over a certain period of time.

Famine

Causes

Drought - A lack of rainfall leads to a lack of water in the water table for plants. This can result in crops failing and the death of livestock, leading to food shortages, primarily for subsistence farmers, but in more extreme cases whole countries.

Disease - A spread of disease through crops can quickly eliminate a years harvest leading to mass famine.

Population Increase - If the population of an area increases too quickly, perhaps due to an influx of refugees, the food supplies may not be able to scale to the demand, leading to a famine.

Cost - When the quantity of available food and livestock falls, the demand and hence cost of food increases. As food prices inflate, people become unable to afford food and begin to starve.

Famine in Ethiopia

Location

Ethiopia itself is located in the east of Africa to the south of the country of Eritrea, north of Kenya. The area is landlocked due to Eritrea splitting off during a civil war. The areas affected by the civil war include Eritrea and Tiya, where the civil war has been taking place. Refugees from the civil war in these areas have fled to Koram, which hosted the majority of the famished during a famine in 1984. More recently, a drought in Ethiopia has led to famine in Gode, in the south of Ethiopia.

When

The initial famines due to civil war and drought were in 1984 - 1985.

Famines occurred again in 2000 due to drought.

Causes

In all cases, drought led to the failure of crops which resulted in famines. In 2000 and 1984-1985 there had been poor rainfall for 3 years. This causes crops to fail and also forced herdsman to slaughter their cattle. The slaughtering of cattle was unusual, since the cattle are generally used for milking, not for meat.

The lack of rain was due to cooler sea temperatures in the Atlantic & Pacific, so less evaporation occurred and hence less rain fell.

A civil war between Ethiopia and Eritrea had been waged for several years

<|begin_of_text|>When I was kidnapped by Muslim insurgents in Iraq in 2004, they wanted one thing. They wanted to know how the Western media worked.

It was a carjacking. Just outside my hotel in Baghdad. One car in front, one behind the vehicle in which I was travelling. They waited until we were out of sight of the Australian-manned checkpoint across the road. Then they struck.

The car in front stopped, blocking our way forward; the car behind blocked our way back. Armed men leapt out of both vehicles. They were dressed like normal Iraqi civilians. Bad shirts, short beards. But they had guns.

I tried to hold the door shut but as they wrenched it open the handle broke off in my hand. Then they were in the car, putting guns to my head. I had one thought at that moment: I am dead.

I fought the guy who got in the back seat. I had his pistol in a grip with both hands and forced it into his groin. He was strong and I remember yelling at my driver to reverse and ram the car blocking the road behind us. He couldn’t; another insurgent was holding a gun to his head and he drove forward as they told him.

I was trying to get my finger on the trigger, to shoot the insurgent beside me in the groin. As we started to drive, I yelled out the window at an Iraqi police checkpoint. I lost my grip on the handgun and that was it.

They are pushing the pornographic limits of their violence. It is about maintaining the attention of the West. It is cynical. And it is effective.

An American convoy went past as we drove out to insurgent-controlled western Baghdad. The man next to me saw my eyes and clamped his arm across me. He knew what I was thinking. But the calculus was this: If I run now will the Yanks shoot me before these guys do? The moment passed. I was in their control.

The men who kidnapped me did not want to kill me, although I didn’t know that yet. What they wanted to know was how to pierce the Western news cycle.

Tied up and blindfolded, I explained to them my role as a freelancer, working for SBS. I explained my previous role as a reporter for wire services including Associated Press. I had a reasonably good understanding of how the international press were operating in Iraq then. Even though the war was a big story by 2004, only the big news organisations had permanent staff there

<|begin_of_text|>Mass and Weight are two often misused and misunderstood terms in mechanics and fluid mechanics.

The fundamental relation between mass and weight is defined by Newton's Second Law. Newton's Second Law can be expressed as

F = m a (1) where F = force (N, lb f ) m = mass (kg, slugs) a = acceleration (m/s2, ft/s2)

Mass

Mass is a measure of the amount of material in an object, being directly related to the number and type of atoms present in the object. Mass does not change with a body's position, movement or alteration of its shape, unless material is added or removed.

an object with mass 1 kg on earth would have the same mass of 1 kg on the moon

Mass is a fundamental property of an object, a numerical measure of its inertia and a fundamental measure of the amount of matter in the object.

Weight

Weight is the gravitational force acting on a body mass. The generic expression of Newton's Second Law (1) can be transformed to express weight as a force by replacing the acceleration - a - with the acceleration of gravity - g - as

F g = m a g (2) where F g = gravitational force - or weight (N, lb f ) m = mass (kg, slugs) a g = acceleration of gravity on earth (9.81 m/s2, 32.17405 ft/s2)

Example - The Weight of a Body on Earth vs. Moon

The acceleration of gravity on the moon is approximately 1/6 of the acceleration of gravity on the earth. The weight of a body with mass 1 kg on the earth can be calculated as

F g_ earth = (1 kg) (9.81 m/s2)

= 9.81 N

The weight of the same body on the moon can be calculated as

F g_ moon = (1 kg) ((9.81 m/s2) / 6)

= 1.64 N

The handling of mass and weight depends on the systems of units used. The most common unit systems are

the International System - SI

the British Gravitational System - BG

the English Engineering System - EE

One newton is

≈ the weight of one hundred grams - 101.972 gf (g F ) or 0.101972 kgf (kg F or kilopond - kp (pondus is latin for weight))

<|begin_of_text|>Image caption Double trouble for dinosaurs: Did more than one asteroid or comet strike cause their demise?

The dinosaurs were wiped out 65 million years ago by at least two space impacts, rather than a single strike, a new study suggests.

Previously, scientists had identified a huge impact crater in the Gulf of Mexico as the event that spelled doom for the dinosaurs.

Now evidence for a second impact in Ukraine has been uncovered.

This raises the possibility that the Earth may have been bombarded by a whole shower of space rocks.

The new findings are published in the journal Geology by a team lead by Professor David Jolley of Aberdeen University, UK.

When first proposed in 1980, the idea that an asteroid or comet impact had killed off the dinosaurs proved hugely controversial. Later, the discovery of the Chicxulub Crater in the Gulf of Mexico was hailed as "the smoking gun" that confirmed the theory.

Double trouble

The discovery of a second impact crater suggests that the dinosaurs were driven to extinction by a "double whammy" rather than a single strike.

The Boltysh Crater in Ukraine was first reported in 2002. However, until now it was uncertain exactly how the timing of this event related to the Chicxulub impact.

In the current study, scientists examined the "pollen and spores" of fossil plants in the layers of mud that infilled the crater. They found that immediately after the impact, ferns quickly colonised the devastated landscape.

Ferns have an amazing ability to bounce back after catastrophe. Layers full of fern spores - dubbed "fern spikes" - are considered to be a good "markers" of past impact events.

However, there was an unexpected discovery in store for the scientists.

They located a second "fern spike" in a layer one metre above the first, suggesting another later impact event.

Professor Simon Kelley of the Open University, UK, who was co-author on the study, said: "We interpret this second layer as the aftermath of the Chicxulub impact."

This shows that the Boltysh and Chicxulub impacts did not happen at exactly the same time. They struck several thousand years apart, the length of time between the two "fern spikes".

Uncertain cause

Professor Kelley continued: "It is quite possible that in the future we will find evidence for more impact events."

Rather than being wiped out by a single hit, the researchers think that dinosaurs may have fallen victim to a shower of space rocks raining down over thousands of years.

<|begin_of_text|>Rice nanomachines constructed to deliver drugs, destroy diseased cells

Motorized molecules driven by light have been used to drill holes in the membranes of individual cells and show promise for either bringing therapeutic agents into the cells or directly inducing the cells to die.

Researchers at Rice, Durham (U.K.) and North Carolina State universities demonstrated in lab tests how rotors in single-molecule nanomachines can be activated by ultraviolet light to spin at 2 to 3 million rotations per second and open membranes in cells.

The researchers used motors based on work by Nobel laureate Bernard Feringa, who won the prize for chemistry in 2016. The motor itself is a paddle-like chain of atoms that can be prompted to move in a single direction when supplied with energy. Properly mounted as part of the cell-targeting molecule, the motor can be made to spin when activated by a light source.

The work detailed this week in Nature was led by chemists James Tour of Rice, Robert Pal of Durham and Gufeng Wang of North Carolina State. Their labs collaborated to create several motorized molecules that can home in on specific cells, and they viewed what happens when they activate the motors with light.

The Tour lab previously demonstrated molecular motors whose diffusion in a solution was enhanced, if not specifically directed, when activated by ultraviolet light. The rotors needed to spin between 2 and 3 megahertz – 2 to 3 million times per second – to show they could overcome obstacles presented by adjacent molecules and outpace natural Brownian motion.

“We thought it might be possible to attach these nanomachines to the cell membrane and then turn them on to see what happened,” Tour said. The motors, only about a nanometer wide, can be designed to target and then either tunnel through a cell’s lipid bilayer membrane to deliver drugs or other payloads or disrupt the 8-10 nanometer-wide membrane, thereby killing the cell. They can also be functionalized for solubility and for fluorescent tracking, he said.

“These nanomachines are so small that we could park 50,000 of them across the diameter of a human hair, yet they have the targeting and actuating components combined in that diminutive package to make molecular machines a reality for treating disease,” Tour said.

The Rice lab created 10 variants, including motor-bearing molecules in several sizes and peptide-carrying nanomachines designed to target specific cells for death, as well as control molecules identical to the other nanomachines but without motors

<|begin_of_text|>A compass made of light promises to be more sensitive than anything in a Boy Scout’s wildest dreams. A light beam shot through a blob of rubidium atoms can directly and reliably measure the size and orientation of a magnetic field, a team of physicists reports in the Sept. 13 Physical Review A.

Highly sensitive compasses are needed for oil discovery, earthquake detection and navigation (in the catastrophic event of a GPS failure, that is). Recently, highly sensitive compasses guided engineers as they drilled relief wells in the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon blowout.

These compasses are very good at finding the size of a magnetic field, but typically have to be tweaked to include a built-in local reference magnetic field so that they can also find the field’s direction. This comparison of the external field to an internal reference allows the compass to reconstruct the magnetic field, but the quality of the data can vary greatly, says study co-author Alexander Zibrov of Harvard University.

Zibrov and his colleagues wanted to create a compass that could directly pinpoint the direction and the size of a magnetic field. To do that, they relied on a technique that used a magnetically sensitive cloud of atoms and a laser. In their experiment, the team trapped rubidium-87 atoms at 113 degrees Fahrenheit in a domino-sized chip and shined linearly polarized light into the atoms. The light was filtered so that it had the same direction, like the light that makes it through polarized sunglasses.

In the presence of a magnetic field, the atoms’ orientation changed in a particular way, and this change was detectable in the light that came through the atom cloud, the team found. This change in transmission allowed the researchers to find the size and direction of the magnetic field at the same time.

Other compasses based on lasers and atoms exist, Zibrov says, but those rely on circularly polarized light and other ways to excite the atoms, and require fancy mathematical models to reconstruct the magnetic field after the measurement has been taken.

In the experiment, the compass detected magnetic fields with a strength between 0.1 gauss, which is less than the Earth’s magnetic field, and 200 gauss, which is stronger than a small iron magnet. The authors write that the performance can be adjusted with design tweaks such as changes to the temperature and size of the chip.

The new study is “a nice piece of work,” says physicist Szymon Pustelny of Jagiellonian University in Kraków,

<|begin_of_text|>Electricity production from large-scale photovoltaic (PV) installations has increased exponentially in recent decades1,2,3. This proliferation in renewable energy portfolios and PV powerplants demonstrate an increase in the acceptance and cost-effectiveness of this technology4,5. Corresponding with this upsurge in installation has been an increase in the assessment of the impacts of utility-scale PV4,6,7,8, including those on the efficacy of PV to offset energy needs9,10. A growing concern that remains understudied is whether or not PV installations cause a “heat island” (PVHI) effect that warms surrounding areas, thereby potentially influencing wildlife habitat, ecosystem function in wildlands, and human health and even home values in residential areas11. As with the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, large PV power plants induce a landscape change that reduces albedo so that the modified landscape is darker and, therefore, less reflective. Lowering the terrestrial albedo from ~20% in natural deserts12 to ~5% over PV panels13 alters the energy balance of absorption, storage, and release of short- and longwave radiation14,15. However, several differences between the UHI and potential PVHI effects confound a simple comparison and produce competing hypotheses about whether or not large-scale PV installations will create a heat island effect. These include: (i) PV installations shade a portion of the ground and therefore could reduce heat absorption in surface soils16, (ii) PV panels are thin and have little heat capacity per unit area but PV modules emit thermal radiation both up and down, and this is particularly significant during the day when PV modules are often 20 °C warmer than ambient temperatures, (iii) vegetation is usually removed from PV power plants, reducing the amount of cooling due to transpiration14, (iv) electric power removes energy from PV power plants, and (v) PV panels reflect and absorb upwelling longwave radiation, and thus can prevent the soil from cooling as much as it might under a dark sky at night.

Public concerns over a PVHI effect have, in some cases, led to resistance to large-scale solar development. By some estimates, nearly half of recently proposed energy projects have been delayed or abandoned due to local opposition11. Yet, there is a remarkable lack of data as to whether or not the PVHI effect is real or simply an issue associated with perceptions of environmental change caused by the installations that lead to “not in my backyard” (NIMBY) thinking.

<|begin_of_text|>Americium-241 (241Am) is an isotope of americium. Like all isotopes of americium, it is radioactive. 241Am is the most common isotope of americium. It is the most prevalent isotope of americium in nuclear waste. Americium-241 has a half-life of 432.2 years. It is commonly found in ionization type smoke detectors. It is a potential fuel for long-lifetime radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). Its common parent nuclides are β− from 241Pu, EC from 241Cm and α from 245Bk. 241Am is fissile and the critical mass of a bare sphere is 57.6-75.6 kilograms and a sphere diameter of 19–21 centimeters.[1] Americium-241 has a specific activity of 3.43 Ci/g (curies per gram or 126.9 gigabequerels (GBq) per gram).[2] It is commonly found in the form of americium-241 dioxide (241AmO 2 ). This isotope also has one meta state; 241mAm, with an excitation energy of 2.2 MeV, and a half-life of 1.23 μs. The presence of americium-241 in plutonium is determined by the original concentration of plutonium-241 and the sample age. Because of the low penetration of alpha radiation, americium-241 only poses a health risk when ingested or inhaled. Older samples of plutonium containing plutonium-241 contain a buildup of 241Am. A chemical removal of americium-241 from reworked plutonium (e.g. during reworking of plutonium pits) may be required in some cases.

Nucleosynthesis [ edit ]

Americium-241 has been produced in small quantities in nuclear reactors for decades, and many kilograms of 241Am have been accumulated by now.[3] Nevertheless, since it was first offered for sale in 1962, its price, about US$1,500 per gram of 241Am, remains almost unchanged owing to the very complex separation procedure.[4]

Americium-241 is not synthesized directly from uranium – the most common reactor material – but from the plutonium isotope 239Pu. The latter needs to be produced first, according to the following nuclear process:
