<|begin_of_text|>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Both President Barack Obama and Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have made opening offers in negotiations to resolve the “fiscal cliff.

Here is a look at the two proposals, which are aimed at averting a more drastic combination of tax increases and spending cuts that economists say could cause a recession:

REPUBLICAN OFFER

House Republican leaders on Monday called for $2.2 trillion in new deficit reductions over 10 years.

When counting deficit reductions enacted last year, anticipated savings from winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and some interest savings, the package would amount to $4.6 trillion in reductions over a decade, according to House Republicans.

The offer made the following proposals to achieve $2.2 trillion in new deficit reductions over 10 years:

* $800 billion in new revenue through tax reform;

* unspecified healthcare program savings of $600 billion;

* other savings from changes to unspecified mandatory spending programs of $300 billion;

* tying cost-of-living increases for federal benefit programs to the Consumer Price Index to get savings of $200 billion;

* and further unspecified savings to domestic spending programs of $300 billion.

House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and six other House Republican leaders made the offer on Monday in a letter to Obama.

DEMOCRATIC OFFER

The White House on Thursday proposed raising tax revenues by nearly $1.6 trillion, in line with what Obama has said is needed for long-term deficit reduction of nearly $4.4 trillion over 10 years.

The administration also sought $200 billion in economic stimulus from a combination of investments including infrastructure spending, extension of a payroll tax cut and jobless benefits.

The White House would also continue individual income tax cuts from the administration of former Republican President George W. Bush for all but the wealthiest earners.

Obama’s negotiators also sought the ability to raise the nation’s borrowing limit unilaterally. At present, Congress must approve an increase in the debt ceiling.

The administration’s proposal would delay across-the-board spending cuts for a year. In exchange the administration agreed to make $600 billion in spending cuts to entitlement programs.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Inflation accounting comprises a range of accounting models designed to correct problems arising from historical cost accounting in the presence of high inflation and hyperinflation.[1] [2] For example, in countries experiencing hyperinflation the International Accounting Standards Board requires corporations to implement financial capital maintenance in units of constant purchasing power in terms of the monthly published Consumer Price Index. This does not result in capital maintenance in units of constant purchasing power since that can only be achieved in terms of a daily index.

Historical cost basis in financial statements [ edit ]

Fair value accounting (also called replacement cost accounting or current cost accounting) was widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but historical cost accounting became more widespread after values overstated during the 1920s were reversed during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Most principles of historical cost accounting were developed after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, including the presumption of a stable currency.[3]

Measuring unit principle [ edit ]

Under a historical cost-based system of accounting, inflation leads to two basic problems. First, many of the historical numbers appearing on financial statements are not economically relevant because prices have changed since they were incurred. Second, since the numbers on financial statements represent dollars expended at different points of time and, in turn, embody different amounts of purchasing power, they are simply not additive. Hence, adding cash of $10,000 held on December 31, 2002, with $10,000 representing the cost of land acquired in 1955 (when the price level was significantly lower) is a dubious operation because of the significantly different amount of purchasing power represented by the two numbers.[4]

By adding dollar amounts that represent different amounts of purchasing power, the resulting sum is misleading, as one would be adding 10,000 dollars to 10,000 Euros to get a total of 20,000. Likewise subtracting dollar amounts that represent different amounts of purchasing power may result in an apparent capital gain which is actually a capital loss. If a building purchased in 1970 for $20,000 is sold in 2006 for $200,000 when its replacement cost is $300,000, the apparent gain of $180,000 is illusory.

Misleading reporting under historical cost accounting [ edit ]

"In most countries, primary financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis of accounting without regard either to changes in the general level of prices or to increases in specific prices of assets held, except to the extent that property, plant

<|begin_of_text|>India's inflation rate has slumped to the lowest level of modern times and there is much talk that the Reserve Bank of India will lower interest rates to stimulate the economy--that might take a little longer than many are predicting. We must always distinguish between general inflation, a general upward pressure on the price level, and specific price changes. This current low inflation rate looks much more like the effect of the latter, thus interest rate changes aren't so warranted.

Growth in industrial production fell to a three-month low in May while consumer price index (CPI)-based inflation declined below a stipulated floor of 2 per cent in June, providing the Reserve Bank of India leeway to cut the policy interest rate in August.

The RBI certainly has the power and the room to cut rates, yes, but that's not quite the correct policy decision here. Which is whether the RBI should cut interest rates as a result of the low inflation and that's much less certain:

Data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on Wednesday showed retail inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), rose an annual 1.5% in June, slower than previous month's 2.2%. This was the slowest pace of increase since the government unveiled the new retail inflation series in 2012. The previous lows were in 1999 and in 1978 under a different series.

My point being that CPI isn't really the correct inflation measure to be using when considering interest rate changes and inflation. The US Federal Reserve, for example, uses the PCE rate although that's not really the important point here. CPI, PCE, RPI, they all have their slight differences and are useful in slightly different manners. But there's a much more important difference we need to take account of:

Aside from the steep fall in food inflation, which has been downplayed by the RBI time and again, the steady and consistent fall in core inflation (non-food and fuel) could find favour with the central bank.

It's this difference between core and non-core inflation that matters. It does depend upon which government and which statistical system we're talking about as to whether all produce core and non-core PCE and RPI and CPI, but in general the distinction is understood between the two different types of inflation rate:

Data on Wednesday showed headline consumer price inflation fell to 1.5 percent in the year to June from an annual 2.2 percent a month ago and below forecasts for a 1.6 percent reading

(Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures fell on Wednesday as Chinese stocks had another roller coaster ride and as investors await the minutes from last month's Federal Reserve meeting for clues on when interest rates will be increased.

* While the health of the U.S. economy appears to be stabilizing, the effect of the yuan devaluation and other macro factors are playing on investor's minds. The Fed minutes will be released at 2 p.m. ET.

* Economists believe the Fed will probably raise rates twice this year, with the first hike coming in September. Investors are still not fully convinced of a September hike, but most are betting a rate hike will occur by the end of year.

* Chinese stocks reversed sharp declines and ended higher after the central bank injected more funds into the financial system for a second day in a bid to calm panicky markets.

* The People's Bank of China devalued the yuan last week, triggering an avalanche of selling by investors globally who feared Beijing wanted to engineer a much sharper decline to support weak exports.

* The Chinese market gyrations kept commodity prices under pressure, with oil and copper near six-year lows.

* Other data due Wednesday is expected to show consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in July, less than the 0.3 percent rise in June. The Consumer Price Index data is due at 8:30 a.m. ET.

* Lowe's shares fell 1.6 percent to $71.85 in premarket trading after the No.2 U.S. home improvement chain's quarterly profit missed expectations.

* Yum Brands rose 1.5 percent to $85.50, a day after the owner of the KFC and Pizza Hut chains announced new leadership for its China division as activist investors lobby the company to spin off that business.

* Staples fell 1.6 percent to $13.93 after the office supplies retailer reported quarterly revenue slightly below analysts' estimates, hurt by a stronger dollar.

There is loads of variation between people in how they perform on such tests, and these differences can be due to genetic and environment factors, and their interplay.

In research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS) today, we show three genetic variants in humans that can account for a couple of IQ points – but before you get excited, these are only three variants out of likely thousands.

The genetics of cognitive performance

While a measure of “intelligence” can be controversial, cognitive performance scores are widely used because of their predictive ability. Educational attainment, income, job performance and health are all correlated with cognitive performance.

By comparing the cognitive performance between family members, including comparisons between identical and non-identical twins, scientists are able to quantify the contribution of genetic and environmental causes of individual differences.

Decades of research have shown that genetic factors account for about half of the causes of individual difference in cognitive performance, and recent studies using unrelated people have confirmed that a substantial proportion of individual difference is due to genetic factors.

So, we know now that cognitive performance is heritable, but where are the genes? Despite considerable attempts to find genes for cognitive performance, no specific genes had been found and replicated.

One reason for this puzzle is that there are a lot of genes involved – thousands, even – and their individual gene effect sizes are tiny. Past studies couldn’t find them because sample sizes were not large enough to detect genes with statistical significance.

So how did we overcome this problem?

Last year, a huge international collaborative study of more than 126,000 people correlated millions of genetic variants with educational attainment and discovered three genetic variants associated with it.

Education attainment is correlated with cognitive performance, so given these two observations, we tested the genetic variants for education attainment with their associations with cognitive performance, which we report in PNAS today.

We tested 69 genetic variants from the educational attainment study (of almost 107,000 people) in independent samples of 24,000 people who had a cognitive performance score. This two-stage strategy is called a “proxy-phenotype method” since educational attainment is a proxy phenotype (an observable characteristic or trait) for cognitive performance.

The essence of this design was to piggy-back on a much larger study from a correlated trait (educational attainment) to pre-select a small number of genetic variants. These were then tested for association with cognitive performance –

Overweight The overweight range according to the body mass index (BMI) is the area on the chart where BMI > 25 Specialty Endocrinology

Being overweight or fat is having more body fat than is optimally healthy. Being overweight is especially common where food supplies are plentiful and lifestyles are sedentary.

As of 2003, excess weight reached epidemic proportions globally, with more than 1 billion adults being either overweight or obese.[1] In 2013 this increased to more than 2 billion.[2] Increases have been observed across all age groups.

A healthy body requires a minimum amount of fat for proper functioning of the hormonal, reproductive, and immune systems, as thermal insulation, as shock absorption for sensitive areas, and as energy for future use. But the accumulation of too much storage fat can impair movement, flexibility, and alter the appearance of the body.

Classification

The degree to which a person is overweight is generally described by the body mass index (BMI). Overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 or more, thus it includes pre-obesity defined as a BMI between 25 and 30 and obesity as defined by a BMI of 30 or more.[3][4] Pre-obese and overweight however are often used interchangeably, thus giving overweight a common definition of a BMI of between 25–30. There are, however, several other common ways to measure the amount of adiposity or fat present in an individual's body.

Body mass index

The body mass index (BMI) is a measure of a person's weight taking into account their height. It is given by the following formula: BMI equals a person's weight (mass) in kilograms divided by the square of the person's height in metres. The units therefore are kg/m2 but BMI measures are typically used and written without units.

BMI provides a significantly more accurate representation of body fat content than simply measuring a person's weight. It is only moderately correlated with both body fat percentage and body fat mass (R2 of 0.68).[5] It does not take into account certain factors such as pregnancy or bodybuilding; however, the BMI is an accurate reflection of fat percentage in the majority of the adult population.

The body volume index (BVI) was devised in 2000 as a computer, rather than manual, measurement of the human body for obesity and an alternative to the BMI

BVI uses 3D software

<|begin_of_text|>Cryptography’s most familiar application is perhaps the sending of coded messages: Alice wants to communicate some information to her distant confidante Bob. She worries that her message might be intercepted by an eavesdropper, so she encrypts it in a way that only Bob can decipher. But there exists a whole range of complementary cryptographic tasks—such as online auctions and secure voting—in which Alice and Bob want to guard against attacks not from eavesdroppers but from each other.

To develop algorithms to perform those other tasks, cryptographers use a building block called bit commitment: Alice chooses a bit (a 1 or 0) to be revealed later; Bob wants to ensure that Alice can’t change her mind in the meantime, while Alice wants to ensure that Bob has no way to learn which bit she chose until the appointed time.

Although quantum theory is the basis for perfectly secure encryption, it offers no path to secure bit commitment. But a different law of physics, the impossibility of faster-than-light signaling, has now come to the rescue, and Anthony Martin, Hugo Zbinden, and their colleagues at the University of Geneva have implemented a protocol for achieving bit commitment for a full 24 hours.

For the protocol to work, Alice and Bob work with trusted partners Amy and Brian, respectively. Bob and Brian take turns exchanging data with Alice and Amy, in such a way that each exchange falls outside the forward light cone of the previous one. Each of Alice’s and Amy’s answers depends on both the data they receive from Bob or Brian and on information Alice and Amy agree on in advance, including the bit they want to commit. For Alice to cheat and change the bit at any time in the middle of the protocol, she’d need to know what happened in Amy’s most recent exchange with Brian; relativity prevents her from having that information.

In their 24-hour implementation, Martin and colleagues repeated the exchanges for 5 billion rounds, one every 17 µs, with a total of 162 GB of data. According to two theory papers from the past year, the probability that the protocol is vulnerable to cheating is less than one in a billion. (E. Verbanis et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 140506, 2016.)<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

University life. (Photo: M. Spencer Green, AP) Story Highlights Administrative bloat at American colleges and universities is out of hand.

One calculation shows college tuition increased from 1978 to 2011 at an annual rate of 7.45%.

Now colleges and universities are actually facing declining enrollments, and even credit downgrades.

"Why am I paying so much tuition to people whose job seems to be telling me to call someone else?"

That was my daughter's lament last week as she tried to pry an essential form out of her college's labyrinthine bureaucracy, but it's a question that many Americans should be asking. Administrative bloat at American colleges and universities is out of hand, and it's probably the biggest cause of the skyrocketing tuitions that afflict students and parents today.

Everyone knows that tuitions have skyrocketed, though many may not appreciate the full extent of the problem. As University of Michigan economics and finance professor Mark Perry has calculated, college tuition increased from 1978 to 2011 at an annual rate of 7.45%. That far outpaced health-care costs, which increased by 5.8%, and housing, which, notwithstanding the bubble, increased at 4.3%. Family incomes, on the other hand, barely kept up with the Consumer Price Index, which grew at an annual rate of 3.8%.

That has led many students (and sometimes their co-signing parents) into a nightmare of debt, as student loans have been used to fill the gap. Now colleges and universities are actually facing declining enrollments, and in some cases even credit downgrades as their ability to endlessly raise tuition comes into question. But why has tuition risen so fast?

Some commentators blame lazy, overpaid faculty. But while faculty teaching loads are somewhat lower than they were decades ago, faculty-student ratios have been quite stable over the past several decades, while the ratio of administrators and staff to students has become much less favorable. In his book on administrative bloat, The Fall Of The Faculty, Johns Hopkins professor Benjamin Ginsberg reports that although student-faculty ratios fell slightly between 1975 and 2005, from 16-to-1 to 15-to-1, the student-to-administrator ratio fell from 84-to-1 to 68-to-1, and the student-to-professional-staff ratio fell from 50-to-1 to 21-to-1.

The Fond du Lac County Finance Committee is considering a proposal that would provide a workaround of the restrictions of the controversial collective bargaining law Act 10 for members of a public employees union.

County Human Resources Director Michael Marx sent a memorandum to the county's Finance Committee in May explaining the limitations the law placed on the AFSCME local 1366E Social Services union.

Act 10 removed the ability of public employees unions to negotiate for anything but a pay increase limited to the Consumer Price Index. The county board approved a 1.57-percent increase for the union's members, which is the maximum allowed under the law this year.

Other non-union county employees received a 2-percent increase without similar restrictions at the beginning of the year.

"In other words, this group is being penalized by the state because they didn't decertify their union," Board Chairman Martin Farrell said.

Marx recommended the board approve a supplemental pay increase for the more than 70 employees affected to make up for the difference. The extra pay would work like a bonus, being paid once in a lump sum in the first pay period of December.

The extra pay would also be based on the number of hours worked, ranging from 7 to 10 cents, depending on the employee's current wages, and would be increased by 1.5 times for overtime. Marx said the payments would amount to between $140 to $190, depending on the employee's wages.

Next year's supplemental pay would have to be reapproved by the board, and every year after, and can't be a part of the union's next contract negotiations. That's because the supplemental pay can't be part of the union's contact under Act 10 and is entirely at the discretion of the board, Marx said.

"This is just the least problematic way of getting the increase to the employees without creating extra coding in our system," County Executive Al Buechel said. "When you look at personnel administration

A key part of the negative reaction has been based on fears that interest free grants will increase housing prices and drive a further wedge between incomes and housing costs, a divide already plaguing the Vancouver and lower mainland markets.

These worries about the divide between housing prices and incomes are well founded.

Trends in residential property prices and housing affordability between 2005 and 2016 paint a grim picture in both Vancouver and the city of Toronto. This article looks at those trends, analyzing the mortgage cost of homes in these two cities and in comparison to Canada more broadly.

More specifically, it looks at the number of weeks of labour time it would take workers making the average weekly wage to make a mortgage purchase in each city. The data are startling.

Methodology:

The nominal dollar cost of a house or a condo today is much higher than it was 10 or 20 years ago. Indeed, it is even higher than what it was just a couple of years ago. There exists a number of indices that look at the price of housing by deflating the nominal dollar price of a house by the consumer price index (CPI) to get an idea of how fast housing prices are rising relative to the general rise in prices of consumer goods.

This article does something different. It calculates how many weeks of labour time, paid at average provincial weekly rates, it takes to purchase an average residential property. In order to do so, it makes some key assumptions.

The calculations in this article concern changes in the mortgage costs of residential property purchases. Here, I assume that the entire price of the properties (inclusive of mortgage fees and financing costs) were paid through a mortgage financed with 5-year mortgage loans amortized over 15 years. In other words, it assumes no initial down payment. By looking at the weeks of labour time, the analysis assumes that all of a person’s income is going towards financing their mortgage. Of course, we know people have many other fixed costs and financial responsibilities. But this measure gives us an informative picture of the glaring gap between incomes and housing prices.

Of course, since we don’t know what interest rates and wage rates will be after 2016, the numbers for the years after 2011 are estimates based on an extrapolation of recent data for these two variables. The calculation also assume, after 2011, a return towards trend values in the case of interest rates). Finally, the data is based on yearly averages. So

A carbon footprint can be measured for an individual or an organization, and is typically given in tons of CO 2 -equivalent (CO 2 -eq) per year. For example, the average North American generates about 20 tons of CO 2 -eq each year. The global average carbon footprint is about 4 tons of CO 2 -eq per year (Figure 1).

An individual’s or organization’s carbon footprint can be broken down into the primary and secondary footprints. The primary footprint is the sum of direct emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels for energy consumption and transportation. More fuel-efficient cars have a smaller primary footprint, as do energy-efficient light bulbs in your home or office. Worldwide, 82% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are in the form of CO 2 from fossil fuel combustion (Figure 2).

The secondary footprint is the sum of indirect emissions of greenhouse gases during the lifecycle of products used by an individual or organization. For example, the greenhouse gases emitted during the production of plastic for water bottles, as well as the energy used to transport the water, contributes to the secondary carbon footprint. Products with more packaging will generally have a larger secondary footprint than products with a minimal amount of packaging.

Jay L Zagorsky is an economist at Ohio State University.

Prom season is now upon us, the key social event of most people’s high school experience. My youngest child is preparing to attend her first senior prom and a steady supply of fancy dresses has begun to appear in our house. As my credit card bills climbed ever higher, I began to wonder, how has the price of the prom changed over time?

For teenagers scraping together money from minimum-wage jobs and informal work like babysitting and snow shoveling, the question has immediate relevance because the price determines if they can afford to go. For parents of teens, the question is relevant because the prom is another expensive bill competing with lots of other financial priorities.

Even for people not directly connected to the high school experience, the price of the prom is important. The U.S. is a melting pot of different cultures, religions and ethnic groups. Tying these disparate groups together is a variety of common shared experiences, such as celebrating the 4th of July, eating turkey at Thanksgiving and, for teens, experiencing the prom.

When the prom’s price goes down, more teens can afford to go, and it becomes a more inclusive shared experience. When the price rises, however, the prom becomes a more exclusive social event attended mostly by those with wealthier parents, resulting in fewer common shared experiences.

Cereal and donuts

It is possible to get a sense of the changing price of going to the prom using government data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides detailed monthly information on the trend in prices over time for a vast number of items purchased by the typical family.

The government does not care, directly, about the price of the prom – unfortunately it has yet to craft a “prom index.” However, using a subset of the inflation data we can see that proms are actually getting relatively cheaper over time.

The typical 17-year-old going to the prom this year was born in 1998. Since then, the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, has increased 45 percent. That means the average item a family bought for $1 in 1998 now costs $1.45. Each month the CPI releases hundreds of detailed price indexes so that anyone can see, for example, if the price of breakfast cereal is rising faster than, say, donuts over time.

Inflation has strongly overshooting the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) target of 4% set for 2017, diving from double-digit price growth in less than two years.

However, the CBR keeps pointing to stubborn inflationary expectations and other medium-terms inflationary risks and sticks to the moderately tight monetary policy despite the pressure from the government to support growth with lower interest. The current rate is by far the lowest in post-Soviet history but the population remain stubbornly convinced that the fall is temporary, according to the CBR surveys. The result is inflationary pressure remains lurking and the CBR is reluctant to accelerate rate cuts until the population expectations of price rises relent.

The CBR decided to cut the key interest rate by 25bp at the board of directors meeting on October 27, in line with the expectations.

A more aggressive cut of 50bp would have meant that the CBR could prepare to tighten the policy again in the beginning of 2018, some analysts suggested. However, the CBR decided to abstain from an aggressive move and cut the rate by the minimum step of 25bp to 8.25%.

Last week Alfa Bank argued that "at the moment we do not agree with the government’s concerns that low inflation is the result of the tight monetary policy of the CBR."

The analysts that forecasted inflation easing to 2.8% in October maintained that "medium-term inflationary risks are considerable and that the CBR should thus not accelerate interest rate cuts."

However, VTB Capital previously argued that "the incoming data for October and November might nudge the Board to opt for a more ambitious cut of 50bp," while noting that "this would call for surprises from inflation reports, banking stats and economic activity data to combine into a convincing case."

The CBR expects inflation to end 2017 at 3.5-3.8%, while the Ministry of Economic Development that needs lower interest rates to help its ambitious 2.1% growth outlook expects 2.7-3.2% inflation in 2017.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Everyone knows about inflation - a pervasive, unstoppable force that moves prices (and hopefully wages) upward in the economy, but do we really understand it? Further analysis reveals that official overall inflation statistics understate the effect of rising prices on the poor.

Understanding Inflation

Inflation is measured through changes in what is called the Consumer Price Index or CPI. This is an aggregate measure of prices based on a certain ‘basket’ of goods composed of those typically consumed by households. It seems like a fair enough way to measure general price increases, but it has the effect of making you think that inflation affects everyone equally - it does not.

The basket of goods is an approximation of the average proportions that households consume. It turns out, however, that there are significant differences in the basket of goods for households from different income levels:

Lower income classes tend to spend more of their income on Food & Beverage, and this proportion drops as we move up the income scale. This is because the absolute level of food consumed in the household is limited, and extra income is allocated to certain ‘luxuries’ and other necessities, evidenced by the fact that higher income households spend more of their income on the other, non-food categories.

Just as a validity check: the data that we generated from the FIES raw data closely approximates the official NSO weighting, except for food and housing. I suspect that imputed rental value was used by the NSO instead of actual rentals paid, but since there was no breakdown in the CPI Technical Notes, I can’t say for sure. Nevertheless, it is the variance in the effect, not the absolute effect, that we are interested in.

So what does this mean? Different income classes will experience different inflation burdens because the prices of goods and services that they consume rise at different rates:

Since the base year 2006, essentials such as food and beverage and education have risen much more than the overall inflation rate. This means that poorer households that spend more of their income on food and beverage will feel a stronger pinch from price increases. Non-essential goods’ prices have risen slower than inflation except for Alcohol & Tobacco which were

<|begin_of_text|>The Bank of Canada will publish the results of its recent review of interest rates on Wednesday, and there is plenty of speculation Governor Stephen Poloz will use the opportunity to raise the bank’s overnight rate, which would increase costs for everything from mortgages to business loans. The speculation is largely based on strong GDP performance for the first quarter of 2017, though one good quarter does not a year make.

Actually, with the interest rate at a historic low of 0.5%—pedal to the metal for the BoC—it is surprising how slowly the economy is moving. The bank is supposed to be able to juice growth by dropping rates. That’s clearly not happening, here or in other parts of the world. Negative interest rates in Europe have been equally ineffective at improving GDP.

However, the Bank of Canada doesn’t actually target economic growth; it targets inflation and nothing more. It wants inflation to run at between 1% and 3%,with all other concerns—from ballooning household debt to employment rates—being secondary to this overriding concern. The bank uses three special inflation measures (CPI-Common, CPI-Median and CPI-trim, which you can read all about here) that attempt to remove the more volatile aspects of the Total Consumer Price Index. I’ve averaged all three together in the chart below to simplify things.

But here’s the trouble. Despite a decent first quarter of GDP growth, the Bank of Canada’s preferred inflation measures are averaging an 18-year low as of May 2017! You’d have to go back to March 1999 to get a lower average inflation rate. Ever since 2010, the bank’s key inflation measures have been nowhere near 3%, or the top of their stated range. In fact, the average inflation rate since 2010 has been only 1.6%, much closer to the bottom of the range than the top. The bank’s inflation measures have been falling steadily over the past 12 months. If anything, the rate of inflation is too low.

But there’s a hidden issue afoot here. Inflation is a sanitized way of talking about wage gains, which are one of its primary components. When the Bank of Canada raises interest rates one of the primary impacts is that it reduces wage gains for working Canadians. As rates rise, businesses cut back, lay some people off and make workers afraid of asking for a raise, hence less inflation. The Bank of Canada inflation range is in effect a ceiling

<|begin_of_text|>LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation hit its highest level since September 2013 last month, extending its sharp rise since the vote to leave the European Union and tightening the squeeze on living costs as a national election approaches.

Consumer prices rose by an annual 2.7 percent, data showed, and they look set to rise further due to the fall in the value of the pound and the recent rise in global oil prices.

Britain’s economy was barely ruffled last year by the shock vote to leave the EU. But the steady rise in inflation since then, combined with weak wage growth, has slowed its momentum this year.

The opposition Labour Party on Tuesday sought to highlight rising costs for voters as it launched its policy proposals for the June 8 election, pledging a higher minimum wage and state involvement in the energy sector to keep prices down.

Last week, Bank of England (BoE) Governor Mark Carney warned 2017 will be challenging for consumers, with inflation now almost certain to overtake wage growth.

“The last thing Britain needs is another real wage slump. But rising prices are hammering pay packets,” Trades Union Congress General Secretary Frances O’Grady said.

Prime Minister Theresa May called the snap election last month to strengthen her mandate to negotiate Britain’s exit from the European Union. But living standards are a big campaign issue, pushing her party into a promise to cap energy prices that breaks with its usually pro-market agenda.

Despite the rise in inflation, however, the economy is far from overheating, and all but one of the BoE’s eight policymakers voted last week to keep interest rates on hold.

AIRFARES SWING IN EASTER

The latest inflation figures were boosted most of all by rising airfares during the Easter holidays which last year took place in March. Rising clothing prices, higher car tax and electricity also pushed up consumer prices.

Many economists see more inflation ahead.

“We remain convinced that the market is underestimating the further upside for inflation from here,” Scotiabank analyst Alan Clarke said. He expects utility bills, food costs and the weak pound to put more pressure on prices in future.

Government data often strip out volatile food prices, but market strategist Nicholas Colas and company say doing so miscalculates inflation expectations among shoppers.

Highlights from the current edition of the now five-year-old quarterly report, especially when combined with traditional government- and industry-issued data and anecdotes, indicate the Fed can be slow with raising interest rates, Colas said. The Fed’s next two meetings come later this month and then in June.

Convergex even trademarked its “Bacon Cheeseburger Index,” an evenly split minibasket of the popular beef-bacon-and-cheese combo that can serve as a relatable inflation gauge. Government data often strip out volatile food prices, but Colas and company say doing so miscalculates inflation expectations among food-conscious shoppers.

As of the first quarter, thanks to price declines in all three of these cholesterol commodities, a bacon cheeseburger now costs 5.1% less than a year ago, the Convergex report shows.

A look back at the Bacon Cheeseburger Index to 1990 finds that it is actually a decent indicator of deflation risk. Prior periods when the BCI turned resoundingly negative (3% or more) since 1990 include: 2009 (financial crisis); 1998 (emerging market and Long Term Capital collapse), and 1992 (the lead up to the Iraq invasion). In each case, the Fed was cutting interest rates, not raising them.

“So should the Fed actually use the Bacon Cheeseburger Index? Of course not. But does it help explain in one compact, if anecdotal, form why the Federal Reserve is happy to hold off on rate increases? I think it does,” said Colas.

High inflation has cost the UK economy £10bn over the last three years, says an influential report.

And with inflation averaging 3.5%, instead of the government's target 2% rate, high inflation will remain "a permanent fixture", says the Ernst & Young Item Club.

This has had a "corrosive impact on the UK economy", the report concludes, as household spending power has shrunk.

The group does not expect inflation to dip below 2.5% before 2017.

Consumers have been struggling to cope with food prices that have risen 40% since 2007, as well as rising fuel and education costs. The UK High Street has suffered as a result.

Despite the economic impact, Carol Astorri, the Club's senior economic adviser said: "It could have been worse. Our modelling shows the [Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee] were right to stick to their guns, allowing inflation to overshoot and avoid tightening monetary policy.

"The alternative scenario would have seen interest rates rise by 3.5% in 2011, choking off the recovery even earlier and adding an additional 625,000 people to UK dole queues."

The report forecasts that the consumer prices index will rise to 3% over the summer, but fall back to 2.5% by the autumn, as energy bills and food prices stabilise.

Mark Gregory, Ernst & Young's chief economist, said: "With consumer spending continuing to be curbed by rising costs and only set to improve gradually, retailers will need to battle harder than ever to win the war for our wallets."

When Mark Carney, the new governor of the Bank of England, takes over from Sir Mervyn King in July, he will face the difficult task of keeping inflation under control while also stimulating the faltering UK economy.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

A new tool developed by Jeff Kaufman, a 27-year-old programmer at Google in Cambridge, allows apartment renters to visualize where Boston’s most and least expensive apartments are. Kaufman's heat map displays the cost per bedroom relative to each Boston neighborhood.

The map indicates the most expensive apartments in Boston tend to hover between Back Bay and Downtown Boston and on into the Seaport District. The region’s least expensive apartments are found near Mattapan, Dorchester and Revere.

Areas of Cambridge along the Red Line also display expensive apartment listings, where the booming tech economy is squeezing commercial rents for startups.

Kaufman's first iteration of the heat map originated in 2011 when he was looking for a place to live.

"I was looking for an apartment and didn't have a good sense of how expensive different parts of the city were," Kaufman says. "I wanted to have a map that gave you a rough idea of the city and how expensive they were."

Reddit user “yiseowl” helped explain the heat map by overlaying the MBTA train map over Kaufman’s. The juxtaposition shows some correlation between rent and MBTA accessibility.

According to Kaufman’s data, which he took from apartment rental search engine Padmapper, the average cost per bedroom in 2013 is $1,314. In 2011, the average cost per bedroom was $1,141.

This is a much greater increase than inflation. The [Consumer Price Index] in June 2011 was 225.922 while the December 2012 one was 229.594, so you would expect $767/room then to turn into $780/room now instead of the $895 we actually see.

<|begin_of_text|>The latest data on the Chinese economy released on Saturday show exports down 8% year-on-year. By any measure you pick, China’s expansion is losing steam.

But working out how much it’s slowing by is extremely hard to do.

Based on a series of different indicators, the economy is currently growing between about 4% and 7% a year. That’s not exactly a small gap, and the truth matters enormously for China, Asia and the rest of the world. The country has a ballooning debt issue that will be much harder to deal with if growth is slow.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch global economist Gustavo Reis and his team sent out a note over the weekend discussing just how much Chinese growth is slowing by a series of different measures.

One of the measures they have looked at is an analyst favourite: The Li Keqiang Index (LKI). Back in 2007, Li reportedly told a US ambassador that he personally looked at the economy with an index made up of three parts: Electricity production, rail traffic, and lending.

Here’s how those three look:

Loans are rising, but electricity production is up by less than 5% year-on-year, and rail traffic is shrinking at rates last seen during the depths of the 2008-09 financial crisis.

So it’s fair to say that it’s not a pretty picture as far as China’s Premier’s favourite economic index is concerned. Here’s how it looks in comparison to GDP:

The BAI (broad activity index) brought together by BAML economists tracks GDP much more closely — it’s a composite of 20 different indicators.

But yet another indicator, the LEAP index, which brings together “power output, crude steel output, cement output, auto sales, housing starts, railway cargo traffic and medium- to long-term loans,” suggests Chinese GDP is even more overblown than the Li Keqiang Index does.

So it’s something of a mystery.

There seem to be at least three possibilities:

The government is lying. This doesn’t seem difficult to imagine. The credibility of the Chinese government is attached to both its ability to provide growth and its ability to exert a high level of control over the economy. Slower growth isn’t something it would like to admit.

<|begin_of_text|>The government has admitted that 800,000 more households stand to lose out under its flagship welfare scheme than previously thought.

In a revised impact assessment of its universal credit scheme, which will replace six of the seven main means-tested benefits and tax credits for those of working age, the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) says that 2.8 million households will get a lower entitlement to benefits. That compares with a figure of 2 million announced in October 2011 after officials first considered how the changes would affect claimants.

The sums are large. About 800,000 households will see an average loss of £137 a month, while the 300,000 hardest hit families will lose as much as £300 a month. About 200,000 lone parents will also receive lower awards under the new scheme than the current system.

The much greater impact is due to a combination of factors – the deteriorating economic environment appears to have added £700m to the costs of the policy according to the Office for Budget Responsibility, while officials also concede that universal credit is less generous than first envisaged. The chancellor's decision last week to raise benefits at a rate lower than the consumer price index will also have affected the scheme.

The revised impact assessment was released late on Tuesday. Ellen Broome, policy director at the Children's Society, said: "We have some serious concerns about how it will affect some of the most disadvantaged children and families. Some of our poorest working families will struggle to afford vital childcare. Our evidence also reveals that many disabled children and disabled lone parents will be significantly worse off."

Labour also questioned whether there were not dwindling savings from the scheme, pointing out that the 2011 impact assessment claimed that universal credit would reduce administrative costs by £500m due to its "reduced complexity". This, says the opposition, has been revised downwards to £200m.

Liam Byrne, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: "Universal credit is now set to be a car crash for 2.8 million families who will be worse off than under the current system. That's nearly 50% more than when plans were first published."

"The very people this government has let down are being asked to pick up the tab for ministers' failure. 300,000 families on middle and modest incomes will lose £3,600 a year – that's £300 a month.

Official data also showed that growth in house prices eased in March, potentially tempering concerns about a bubble brewing in the property market although some more up-to-date surveys have shown prices picking up again.

The consumer price index rose more than expected to an annual rate of 1.8 percent in April, from 1.6 percent in March, which had been its lowest level in more than four years, the Office for National Statistics ONS said.

It was the first rise in the CPI since June 2013 and above a Reuters poll forecast for inflation of 1.7 percent in April.

Sterling hit a 16-month high against the euro and rose against the dollar before giving up much of its gains as market expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates in about a year’s time remained largely intact.

The opposition Labour party jumped on Tuesday’s figures, saying they showed the government’s complacency about the “cost of living” crisis facing many Britons as wage growth has lagged inflation.

Economists however saw little change in price pressures.

“Easter effects aside, the latest release provides little evidence of significant or broad-based price pressures,” said Victoria Clarke, an economist with bank Investec.

Factory gate inflation in April was weaker than economists’ predictions.

Higher airfares linked to Easter and other transport costs helped push up consumer prices, the ONS said. Easter fell in April this year but in late March last year.

Offsetting those rises, food price growth was the lowest in eight years as a mild spring kept vegetable prices down.

Core CPI, which excludes food costs and other items but does include transport costs, rose 2.0 percent, its strongest rate since September last year.

House prices - which are an increasing source of concern for the Bank of England - were up 8.0 percent on the year in March, slowing from a 9.2 percent rise in February, the ONS also said.

Prices in London, however, were up 17 percent on the year, although that was less than a 17.8 percent increase in February, the biggest increase since 200

<|begin_of_text|>Choir singing is known to promote wellbeing. One reason for this may be that singing demands a slower than normal respiration, which may in turn affect heart activity. Coupling of heart rate variability (HRV) to respiration is called Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). This coupling has a subjective as well as a biologically soothing effect, and it is beneficial for cardiovascular function. RSA is seen to be more marked during slow-paced breathing and at lower respiration rates (0.1 Hz and below). In this study, we investigate how singing, which is a form of guided breathing, affects HRV and RSA. The study comprises a group of healthy 18 year olds of mixed gender. The subjects are asked to; (1) hum a single tone and breathe whenever they need to; (2) sing a hymn with free, unguided breathing; and (3) sing a slow mantra and breathe solely between phrases. Heart rate (HR) is measured continuously during the study. The study design makes it possible to compare above three levels of song structure. In a separate case study, we examine five individuals performing singing tasks (1–3). We collect data with more advanced equipment, simultaneously recording HR, respiration, skin conductance and finger temperature. We show how song structure, respiration and HR are connected. Unison singing of regular song structures makes the hearts of the singers accelerate and decelerate simultaneously. Implications concerning the effect on wellbeing and health are discussed as well as the question how this inner entrainment may affect perception and behavior.

Introduction

This paper aims to illuminate and discuss how singing (Grape et al., 2003) and especially choir singing (Marti, 2012) promotes wellbeing. We focus on the interplay between two oscillators: the respiratory organ and the heart, while singing. The heart does not keep a constant rhythm. On the contrary, heart rate (HR) is accelerating and decelerating constantly. This fluctuation in HR is called heart rate variability (HRV). In this article, we mainly speak of the dynamic aspects of HRV, i.e., how HR develops over time forming cycles of HR fluctuations, but we also measure HRV by RMSSD (Root Mean Square of the Successive Differences) (Degiorgio et al., 2010).

It is known that HRV and respiration rate affect each other. This interdependency, first discussed by (Ludwig, 1847), is referred to as respiratory sinus

<|begin_of_text|>NYT Pick Keynes Florida 1 day ago In macroeconomic terms, an increase in taxes followed by an equivalent increase in spending (and that therefore does not increase the deficit) increases the GDP. It is called “the balanced budget multiplier” (you can Google it!), BBM.

Conversely, a reduction in taxes followed by a reduction in spending reduces the GDP, and therefore increases unemployment.

In this particular case (repeal of the ACA), the reduction in taxes benefits higher income people who have a relatively low “marginal propensity to consume” (Google it!), MPC, and negatively affects lower income people, who have a relatively higher MPC. The net effect is that a reduction in taxes and an equal reduction in spending will decrease the GDP by an amount larger than the reduction in taxes. The effect on the unemployment rate will be larger than predicted by the BBM.

Will the repeal of the ACA be the trigger for the next recession/depression?

How long will it take for the country to be plunged into a depression? (a) two years (b) four years (c) eight years.

It will depend on how large are the tax and spending cuts.

NYT Pick PeterS Boston, MA 1 day ago Mr. Krugman is right that Mr. Obama has left the country in near top shape for Mr. Trump and it is unlikely that expansion will last forever. Incidentally, things getting worse may not even be Mr. Trump's doing. While we liberals are not cheering for the success of most Trump's policies, all conscientious citizens should be extra vigilant when economic turns bad and lives get tough. History has repeatedly told us that tough times were the breeding group for authoritarians and fascists. Demagogues never had solutions but they had risen by channeling the anger of the people against chosen minorities. I hope that America will stay prosperous despite Trump and his regressive policies will be reversed over time. I hope that if bad economic times will come, we will choose a wise and compassionate leader next time to take us out of it. However, history should have taught us to be watchful; this election has shown that the wisdom of, we, the American people is not infallible. Flag

Turkey’s economy grew at a surprising 4 percent in the third quarter from the same period in the previous year, the Turkish Statistics Institute (TÜİK) reported on Dec. 10, beating expectations and showing the economy in better shape than many analysts had forecasted.The figure exceeded analyst consensus estimates at 2.7 percent. Adjusted for seasonal and calendar factors, gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.4 percent in the third quarter from the same period of 2014 and 1.3 percent from the second quarter of 2015, it added.Özgur Altuğ, chief economist at BGC Partners in Istanbul, said the rise came despite political uncertainty surrounding the Nov. 1 election and increased attacks by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK).“The data confirmed that the economy continued to accelerate in the third quarter despite political uncertainty and rising terrorism,” he said.Coupled with better-than-expected October industrial output figures, Altuğ said he would revise the 2015 GDP growth forecast from 2.7 percent to 3.4 percent.“The figures confirm the Turkish economy’s resilience to shocks,” he said.“Solid domestic demand continues to fuel growth in Turkey,” Christopher Dembik, an economist with Saxo Bank, told Anadolu Agency.“Consumers had held back spending when the Turkish Lira lost value earlier this year. Now that it has stabilized, confidence in spending has returned,” Dembik added.Household final consumption expenditure increased by 10.6 in the quarter at current prices, the report said.The Consumer Confidence Index increased to 77.15 in November from 62.78 in October.Growth was up from 3.8 percent in the second quarter. The nine-month GDP growth rate increased by 3.4 percent in the third quarter of 2015, the report said.Increasing agriculture activity contributed the most to the GDP increase. The sector increased by 20.1 percent at current prices from the same quarter in 2014, the report said.The value added by industry increased by 7.5 percent in the quarter, the research said.

As part of the stress tests, which the Fed announced it wants banks to do annually, U.S. lenders will have to simulate the effects of a severe recession hitting the U.S. What does that involve, you ask?

In the Fed’s bleakest scenario, the United States would slip into recession in the fourth quarter of 2011 (the one we’re currently in) and post four consecutive quarters of negative growth. The unemployment rate would peak at 13.05%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average would plunge all the way to 5,668 points (from the current level of 11,305). That would be even lower than the Dow’s financial crisis low in March 2009, when it settled at 6,547.

The Fed’s simulated recession would be deepest in the first quarter of 2012, when real GDP would contract by a whopping 7.98%. Peak unemployment wouldn’t hit until a year later.

Overall, the tests, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, lay out 14 economic metrics for banks to include as means of testing their preparedness. The metrics include Consumer Price Inflation levels, Treasury Yields and mortgage rates.

The tests are designed for the top 31 banks in the U.S. that hold assets of US$50-billion or more. They will generate models that will produce loss estimates and see whether capital ratios are high enough to survive the worst-case scenarios.

The Fed will also allow banks to come up with their own scenarios to stress test their finances. Either way, it will requires banks to submit their capital plans by January 9, 2012.

For a full list of the metrics that will be used in the tests, check out the U.S. Federal Reserve’s website.

Net worth boosted by stocks, housing

Consumer credit growth may be slowing in Canada, but the key measure of household debt has hit a record.

That measure, household credit market debt to disposable income, climbed in the third quarter of the year to 163.7 per cent, from a revised 163.1 per cent in the previous three-month period, Statistics Canada said Friday.

At the same time, the net worth of Canadian families rose 2.2 per cent, buoyed by rising stock markets and property values.

Story continues below advertisement

On a per-capita basis, net worth among Canadian households rose in the latest quarter to $211,400, though that masks the income inequality across the country.

"Shares and other equities grew on the basis of the rebound in domestic and foreign equity markets," Statistics Canada said.

"The increase in household net worth was also supported by a 1.5-per-cent gain in the value of household real estate."

The higher debt burden could well spell trouble for some families when interest rates inevitably rise, though the Bank of Canada is believed to be more than a year away from such a move.

Here are some of the highlights from the federal agency's report:

Household net worth rose by 2.2 per cent to $211,000, led by a 3.7-per-cent rise in the stock market.

Real estate values rose by 1.5 per cent.

Consumer credit debt rose by 1 per cent to $505-billion.

The consumer credit debt to disposable income ratio climbed to 163.7 per cent from 163.1 per cent.

Mortgage debts rose by 1.8 per cent to $1.1-trillion, compared with the average quarterly growth of 1.7 per cent over the past five years.

National net worth climbed 2.1 per cent to $7.5-trillion, or, on a per-capita basis, $212,700. That's a slower pace than the second quarter's 3.2-per-cent rise.

Home sales, of course, have rebounded smartly in Canada since the short government-induced slump in the summer of 2012, brought on by new mortgage insurance restrictions aimed at stopping a bubble.

Some of that is deemed to be the result of home buyers jumping in earlier than they otherwise would have because of higher mortgage rates and speculation of further increases.

The price to earnings ratio (denoted P/E) measures the relationship between the share price to its earnings per share. It is considered one of the most important metric of a company because comparing two similar companies’ P/E shows us which is a better value. Sometimes, people will refer to this ratio as the price to earnings multiple, or simply the multiple of a company.

What Price-Earnings Ratio Represents

The P/E ratio lets investors know what the price of a particular stock is related to the earnings it makes. If a company makes $5 and has a share price of $50, then the P/E is simply 10 (50 divided by 5). With this information, an investor can clearly see that the general public is currently willing to pay $10 for every $1 that the company makes. This also means that the lower this number, the better value the investment potentially is.

What the Ratio is Telling Us

Investors love growth. So a high P/E usually represents the general public anticipating high growth in the months ahead. This could be based on the company’s track record, anticipation of a new product launch, or macroeconomics such as a good economy.

In some ways, this ratio also tells us the confidence level in the stock. When investors are willing to pay a higher multiple for a stock versus another, it generally means that they are more confident that the company’s share price will rise quicker the rest.

A Simple Example

Company A and B having a stock price of $20 and $30 respectively says nothing about the relative value of the enterprises. However, if they both earn $1 per share, then comparing their P/E ratio of 20 and 30 tells us that investors are currently willing to pay $20 for each dollar that company A earns and $30 for each dollar company B makes. With this information, we can see that company A is a relatively better value than company B if all else is equal.

What to Watch Out For

Investors need to take caution when comparing P/E ratios of two companies. If we look at different industries, we will see vast differences in P/E ratios. For instance, technology stocks’ having a P/E of 30 is not uncommon but an oil service company may have a P/E of 10. While the oil service company may look like a better value, it does not mean that every oil service company is a better investment than a technology company. Therefore, P/E ratios should be used to compare

Unchanged interest rates would imply your home loan EMIs, which eat away large chunks of household incomes, are unlikely to fall anytime soon.

High loan rates could influence people’s decision to buy houses, cars and other consumer goods, mostly bought through loans.

The benchmark lending rate has remained unchanged since January last year, demonstrating the RBI governor’s unwavering commitment to keep inflation firmly bottled up for longer period of time, before softening of the rather hawkish stance.

Budding revival signs in the broader economy and falling inflation rates had rekindled hopes that the RBI would lower loan rates to assist companies’ investment plans, critical to spin jobs and multiply income.

Rajan retained the repo rate -- the rate at which banks borrow from RBI -- at 8%, and kept the cash reserve ratio (CRR)-- the proportion of deposits banks to have to park with the central bank -- at 4%, in the bi-month monetary policy review.

Retail inflation eased in to a three-year low of 5.52% in October, below the central bank's target of 6% by 2016.

India’s wholesale inflation rate -- the main gauge to capture country-wide price movements -- has also plunged to a five-year low of 1.77% in October, triggering a chorus of demand for lower borrowing costs to boost investment and consumer spending.

The next monetary policy is scheduled for February 3, 2015, but Rajan did not rule out a rate revision outside of the policy calendar depending on future price movements.

“A change in the monetary policy stance at the current juncture is premature. However, if the current inflation momentum and changes in inflationary expectations continue, and fiscal developments are encouraging, a change in the monetary policy stance is likely early next year, including outside the policy review cycle,” Rajan said.

Analysts said the RBI governor could wait for cues to come from the next year’s Union budget in February before initiating any rate action.

Industry leaders have been ratcheting up their demand for cheaper loans with the government also hoping that the central bank would signal a reversal of its prolonged hawkish stance that some see as affecting capacity expansion plans.

According to experts low and stable interest rates are critical to fast-track roads, ports, airports, and railways projects to create

India's economic growth rate picked up strongly in the most recent quarter, according to official figures.

The economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.8% in the July-to-September period, up from 4.4% in the previous quarter.

The acceleration was faster than analysts had been expecting.

Asia's third-largest economy has been weighed down by various factors, such as high inflation, a weak currency and a drop in foreign investment.

This is the fourth quarter in a row that India's annual growth rate has been below the 5% mark, and the previous quarter's rate of 4.4% was the lowest for four years.

Earlier this year, the Indian prime minister's economic advisory council lowered the growth outlook for the current financial year.

It now expects the economy to expand by 5.3% this year, down from its earlier projection of 6.4%.

Growth hurdles

India's economy has been hurt by a range of factors in recent months, including a slowdown in key sectors such as mining and manufacturing.

Slowing growth, coupled with a recovery in developed markets, such as the US, has made India a less attractive option for foreign investors.

Speculation that the US may scale back its key economic stimulus measure has seen investors pull money out of emerging markets, such as India.

This has affected India's currency, which dipped nearly 25% against the US dollar between January and September this year.

Though the rupee has recovered a little since then, it is still down about 13% against the dollar since the start of this year.

That has made imports more expensive and contributed to a high rate of consumer inflation, which was 10.1% October, up from 9.84% in September.

High food and fuel prices have contributed to inflation becoming "entrenched", finance minister P Chidambaram said.

As a result, the central bank has had to raise the cost of borrowing in a bid to curb inflation.

The latest interest rate rise in October saw the key rate increase to 7.75%.

Some observers argue that high interest rates are hurting businesses and households, and having a negative impact on the economy.

"A combination of weak investment, high inflation and tight monetary policy would not let India's economic recovery gather steam any time soon," Miguel Chanco, Asia economist at Capital Economics, told the BBC.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

The statistics are commonly measured by the absolute number of adherents, the percentage of the absolute growth per year, and the growth of the number of converts in the world. Projections of future religious adherence are based on assumptions that trends, total fertility rates, life expectancy, political climate, conversion rates, secularization, etc will continue. Such forecasts cannot be validated empirically and are contentious, but are useful for comparison.[1][2]

Studies in the 21st century show that, in terms of percentage and worldwide spread, Islam is the fastest-growing religion in the world.[3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] A religious forecast for 2050 by Pew Research Center concludes that global Muslim population is expected to grow at a faster rate than the non-Muslim population due primarily to the young age and high fertility rate of Muslims.[12][13] Religious conversion has little impact on Muslim population because the number of people who convert to Islam is nearly offset by those who leave Islam.[6][14][14][15][16]

Growth of religious groups [ edit ]

Bahá'í Faith [ edit ]

World religions statistics place the Bahá'í Faith around 0.1% of the world population in recent years.[17][18] The World Christian Encyclopedia estimated only 7.1 million Bahá'ís in the world in 2000, representing 218 countries,[18] and its evolution to the World Christian Database (WCD) estimated 7.3 million in 2010[19] while accredited through the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA). However the WCD stated: "The Baha'i Faith is the only religion to have grown faster in every United Nations region over the past 100 years than the general population; Baha'i [sic] was thus the fastest-growing religion between 1910 and 2010, growing at least twice as fast as the population of almost every UN region."[20] This source's only documented flaw was to consistently have a higher estimate of Christians than in other cross-national data sets.[21] 2015's estimate is of 7.8 million Bahá'ís in the world.[22]

From its origins in the Persian and Ottoman empires of the 19th century the Bahá'í Faith was able to gain converts elsewhere in Asia, Europe, and North America by the early 20th

I sat on the porch

Listened to the rain

Smoked a cigarette

And counted to ten Oh no, here it comes again

That funny feeling ― Camper Van Beethoven, Oh No! (1985)

A quick post-Fed follow-up to “Tell My Horse”, the best-received Epsilon Theory note to date (thank you!). I’ll jump right into what I’ve got to say, without the usual 20 pages of movie quotes and the like. Well, I’ve got one quote above, because I can’t help myself. They’re the lyrics to the best break-up song ever, and they’re what Janet Yellen was singing to the market on Wednesday.

Let’s review, shall we? Last fall, the Fed floated the trial balloon that they were thinking about ways to shrink their balance sheet. All very preliminary, of course, maybe years in the future. Then they started talking about doing this in 2018. Then they started talking about doing this maybe at the end of 2017. Two days ago, Yellen announced exactly how they intended to roll off trillions of dollars from the portfolio, and said that they would be starting “relatively soon”, which the market is taking to be September but could be as early as July.

Now what has happened in the real world to accelerate the Fed’s tightening agenda, and more to the point, a specific form of tightening that impacts markets more directly than any sort of interest rate hike? Did some sort of inflationary or stimulative fiscal policy emerge from the Trump-cleared DC swamp? Umm … no. Was the real economy off to the races with sharp increases in CPI, consumer spending, and other measures of inflationary pressures? Umm … no. On the contrary, in fact.

Two things and two things only have changed in the real world since last fall. First, Donald Trump — a man every Fed Governor dislikes and mistrusts — is in the White House. Second, the job market has heated up to the point where it is — Yellen’s words — close to being unstable, and is — Yellen’s words — inevitably going to heat up still further.

<|begin_of_text|>NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- There will be no cost-of-living increase for 57 million Social Security beneficiaries next year because consumer prices have fallen, the Social Security Administration announced on Thursday.

It marks the first time that Social Security benefits have not been increased year over year since the cost-of-living adjustment was put into effect in 1975.

To help counterbalance the hit, President Obama is calling on Congress to send another $250 relief payment to seniors and other Americans to stem the economic strain.

"Even as we seek to bring about recovery, we must act on behalf of those hardest hit by this recession," Obama said in a statement Wednesday. "That is why I am announcing my support for an additional $250 in emergency recovery assistance to seniors, veterans, and people with disabilities to help them make it through these difficult times."

Last year, Social Security beneficiaries got a 5.8% cost-of-living adjustment, the largest since 1982, largely because of the spike in energy prices.

"This year, in light of the human need, we need to support President Obama's call for us to make another $250 recovery payment for 57 million Americans," said Commissioner of Social Security Michael J. Astrue in a written statement.

Since there will be no COLA for benefits, the law also prohibits the Social Security Administration from increasing the maximum amount of earnings subject to the Social Security tax. This year and next, the first $106,800 of a worker's earnings is subject to the 12.4% Social Security tax. Workers typically pay half of that and their employers pay the other half.

It's still not clear yet what if any changes will be made to seniors' Medicare Part B premiums for hospital care next year. The Social Security Administration said in its announcement that if there is an increase that a "hold harmless" provision in the law would protect 93% of Social Security beneficiaries from the increase.

New emergency payment similar to COLA

Obama's proposed $250 payment is roughly equal to a 2% increase in benefits for the average Social Security beneficiary.

Congress approved a similar payment as part of the $787 billion economic recovery act enacted in February.

As with the first $250 recovery payment, the second one would be exempt from income tax, a senior administration official said in a call with reporters on Wednesday.

If approved by Congress, the payments would be sent out in 2010, most likely in the first half. "It wouldn't be late in 2010," the administration official

Salt Lake City, Utah, November 17, 2016 – ACM, the world's leading professional computing society, has named a 12-member Chinese team the recipients of the 2016 ACM Gordon Bell Prize for their research project, “10M-Core Scalable Fully-Implicit Solver for Nonhydrostatic Atmospheric Dynamics.” The winning team presented a solver (method for calculating) atmospheric dynamics. The ACM Gordon Bell Prize tracks the progress of parallel computing and rewards innovation in applying high performance computing to challenges in science, engineering, and large- scale data analytics. The award was bestowed during the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC16) in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Since the dawn of computing, scientists have used data analytics in an effort to predict and simulate the weather and related atmospheric events. In the early years of weather forecasting, scientists might have used standard central processing units (CPUs). With each passing year, the continued expansion in the capabilities of high performance computers has enabled researchers to employ increasingly sophisticated computational methods for the analysis and modeling of weather patterns. Advanced scientific computers break problems down into composite parts and perform immense amounts of mathematical calculations simultaneously. The performance of a supercomputer is measured in floating-point operations per second (FLOPS). Some of the latest supercomputers are capable of performing quadrillions of FLOPS.

In the abstract of their presentation, the winning team writes, “On the road to the seamless weather-climate prediction, a major obstacle is the difficulty of dealing with various spatial and temporal scales. The atmosphere contains time-dependent multi-scale dynamics that support a variety of wave motions.”

To simulate the vast number of variables inherent in a weather system developing in the atmosphere, the winning group presents a highly scalable fully implicit solver for three-dimensional nonhydrostatic atmospheric simulations governed by fully compressible Euler equations. Euler equations are a set of equations frequently used to understand fluid dynamics (liquids and gasses in motion).

Elaborating further, they add, “In the solver, we propose a highly efficient domain-decomposed multigrid preconditioner that can greatly accelerate the convergence rate at the extreme scale. For solving the overlapped subdomain problems, a geometry-based pipelined incomplete LU factorization method is designed to further exploit the on-chip fine-grained concurrency.”

The fully-implicit solver successfully scales to the entire system of the Sunway TaihuLight, a Chinese super

Global growth is forecast to be a little below average for a time. Risks to the outlook are still seen to be on the downside, largely as a result of the situation in Europe, though the uncertainty over the course of US fiscal policy is also weighing on sentiment at present. Recent data suggest that the US economy is recording moderate growth and that growth in China has stabilised. Around Asia generally, growth has been dampened by the more moderate Chinese expansion and the weakness in Europe.

Key commodity prices for Australia remain significantly lower than earlier in the year, though trends have been more mixed over the past few months. The terms of trade have declined by about 15 per cent since the peak, to a level that is still historically high.

Sentiment in financial markets remains better than it was in mid year, in response to signs of progress in addressing Europe's financial problems, though Europe is likely to remain a source of instability for some time. Long-term interest rates faced by highly rated sovereigns, including Australia, remain at exceptionally low levels. Capital markets remain open to corporations and well-rated banks, and Australian banks have had no difficulty accessing funding, including on an unsecured basis. Borrowing conditions for large corporations are similarly attractive and share prices have risen since mid year.

In Australia, most indicators available for this meeting suggest that growth has been running close to trend over the past year, led by very large increases in capital spending in the resources sector, while some other sectors have experienced weaker conditions. Looking ahead, recent data confirm that the peak in resource investment is approaching. As it does, there will be more scope for some other areas of demand to strengthen.

Private consumption spending is expected to grow, but a return to the very strong growth of some years ago is unlikely. Available information suggests that the near-term outlook for non-residential building investment, and investment generally outside the resources sector, remains relatively subdued. Public spending is forecast to be constrained. On the other hand, there are indications of a prospective improvement in dwelling investment, with dwelling prices moving a little higher, rental yields increasing and building approvals having turned up.

Inflation is consistent with the medium-term target, with underlying measures at around 2½ per cent. The introduction of the carbon price affected consumer prices in the September quarter, and there could be some further small effects over the next couple of quarters. Partly

<|begin_of_text|>EspañolThe value of the Venezuelan bolívar has plummeted in the past month, depreciating from 102.56 to 159.02 per US dollar on the black-market exchange. November’s decline indicates that Venezuela now flirts with hyperinflation.

The rule of thumb among economists is that hyperinflation occurs when inflation — the declining purchasing power of a currency as measured by a rise in the price level — exceeds 50 percent on a monthly basis. As deduced from the black-market exchange rate and the US Consumer Price Index, Venezuela’s inflation for November reached 55.27 percent.* Even the highest denomination of the bolívar, the 100 Bs. note, is now worth a mere 62.9 US cents.

If Venezuela were to continue November’s free-fall trajectory for the bolívar, its annual compounded inflation would reach 19,633 percent.

While DolarToday is the most commonly referenced website for the bolívar’s informal exchange rates, Aguacate Verde and Lechuga Verde both uphold the trend (at 146 Bs. per US dollar). Of the three, DolarToday is the only one that offers a publicly available data record (Excel), enabling comparisons between past and present exchange rates.

The Bolívar’s Disappearing Act

In a country with three fixed official exchange rates — all with rationed supplies of foreign currencies — the informal rate has become the most accurate gauge of the bolívar’s underlying purchasing power.

“The black market rate is a very good indicator of what the exchange rate should be,” says Boris Ackerman, an economist and professor at Simon Bolívar University in Caracas. “Public expectations and speculation continue to drive the rate up despite strict financial controls enacted by the government.”

In an economy defined by crisis, Venezuelans are scrambling from the bolívar to take refuge in the US dollar, which offers a relatively more stable alternative and store of value. In response, President Nicolás Maduro has worked to steadily decrease the availability of US dollars within the country, even going so far as to outlaw transactions in greenbacks.

This year, the Chavista regime also introduced the third SICAD II rate, in an attempt to curb the thriving black market. However, the measure has since backfired, and the black-market exchange rate has more than doubled since SICAD II’s introduction in March.

<|begin_of_text|>The balance of trade, commercial balance, or net exports (sometimes symbolized as NX), is the difference between the monetary value of a nation's exports and imports over a certain period.[1] Sometimes a distinction is made between a balance of trade for goods versus one for services. The balance of trade measures a flow of exports and imports over a given period of time. The notion of the balance of trade does not mean that exports and imports are "in balance" with each other.

If a country exports a greater value than it imports, it has a trade surplus or positive trade balance, and conversely, if a country imports a greater value than it exports, it has a trade deficit or negative trade balance. As of 2016, about 60 out of 200 countries have a trade surplus. The notion that bilateral trade deficits are bad in and of themselves is overwhelmingly rejected by trade experts and economists.[2][3][4][5][6]

Explanation [ edit ]

Balance of trade in goods and services (Eurozone countries)

US trade balance from 1960

U.S. trade balance and trade policy (1895–2015)

U.S. trade deficit (in billions, goods and services) by country in 2017

U.K. balance of trade in goods (since 1870)

The balance of trade forms part of the current account, which includes other transactions such as income from the net international investment position as well as international aid. If the current account is in surplus, the country's net international asset position increases correspondingly. Equally, a deficit decreases the net international asset position.

The trade balance is identical to the difference between a country's output and its domestic demand (the difference between what goods a country produces and how many goods it buys from abroad; this does not include money re-spent on foreign stock, nor does it factor in the concept of importing goods to produce for the domestic market).

Measuring the balance of trade can be problematic because of problems with recording and collecting data. As an illustration of this problem, when official data for all the world's countries are added up, exports exceed imports by almost 1%; it appears the world is running a positive balance of trade with itself. This cannot be true, because all transactions involve an equal credit or debit in the account of each nation. The discrepancy is widely believed to be explained by transactions intended to launder money or evade taxes, smuggling and other visibility problems. Especially for developing countries, the transaction statistics are likely to be inaccurate.

<|begin_of_text|>New data from the Federal Reserve continues to highlight a reemergence of debt based consumer spending. Americans are largely buying stuff they can’t afford with money they don’t have. The Fed’s consumer credit report highlights a troubling trend. Over the last 12 months 95 percent of all consumer debt growth has come from people buying cars and young Americans going deep into debt to pursue a college education. A car quickly loses its value once it drives off the lot and many college degrees are massively over valued only being supported by easy financing. This is a disturbing trend, even more troubling than the last debt fueled bubble. One can argue with housing that at least people are getting an asset that generally rises with inflation. But a car? A for-profit degree? The debt juice is now flowing once again.

Buying cars while incomes drop

If we look at incomes and car sales we find that households are simply purchasing cars by borrowing from the future:

The Fed consumer credit report merely confirms what we suspect. The dramatic jump in auto buying isn’t coming because households are suddenly wealthier but because consumer debt is booming once again. Cars are not “good” assets and unfortunately, many Americans need to grow their net worth but adding a depreciating vehicle on your balance sheet isn’t exactly a smart plan.

The consumer credit report shows that 95 percent of consumer debt growth in the last 12 months has come in the form of auto loans and student debt:

Source: ZeroHedge, Fed

When you factor in the reality that student debt is now the largest debt market outside of mortgage debt, you realize that many young Americans are saddling their lives in the red even before they begin their working careers.

Total student debt in the US is well over $1.2 trillion as measured by new Fed data:

So we are now having another expansion completely based on easy access to debt. For banks, this access never went away in the form of cheap money via the Fed. The Fed’s balance sheet is now quickly approaching $4 trillion. We are told that there is no inflation but real estate values are spiking at a rate last seen during the last bubble but household incomes are not going up. Of course this time the price of real estate is being pushed up by Wall Street investors. At least in the last bubble, most Americans had access to mortgages, credit cards, and all other forms of cheap debt to party with Wall Street. Today, it seems like consumers have the option of auto loans or student debt. Good luck trying to buy a home in some

Shoppers were already lined up outside of Target, Best Buy, and J.C. Penney, according to CNBC. Walmart stores went into Black Friday sales mode at 6 p.m.

Discounts are not expected to be especially attractive this year. What is driving the surge in shopping is much stronger consumer confidence. In October, consumer sentiment hit a 13-year high. That cooled slightly but remained above economist expectations in November, signaling that the surge has staying power. Consumers indicate that they feel good about their current financial situation as well as their expectations for the future. Certainty about the outlook for income, employment, and inflation are all vastly improved from past years.

Overall, consumer sentiment is around five percent higher than it was the previous November, according to the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment survey. Deloitte projects that holiday shopping will rise between 4 percent last year and 4.5 percent this year.

Another plus for retailers: moderate weather. It is chilly in much of the country but not frigid. The sun is literally shining across almost all of the United States on the day after Thanksgiving. That will likely drive many people out of their homes and into shopping malls.

Much of the shopping has shifted online, however. According to Adobe Analytics, Americans spent $1.52 billion on Thanksgiving evening–a 17 percent surge over last year.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>During the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) press conference last week, one exchange stood out. Asked about a meeting scheduled by the finance ministry in New Delhi to discuss the RBI’s policy, the governor of India’s central bank, Urjit Patel, replied: “The meeting did not take place. All the MPC members declined the request of the finance ministry for that meeting."

The MPC is the Monetary Policy Committee, a six-member council that sets India’s benchmark interest rates. It’s a new institution, less than a year old; Patel’s predecessor, Raghuram Rajan, had full authority to set interest rates himself. But it seems India’s government is not as comfortable as many had hoped with this new arrangement—summoning the MPC members to the finance ministry before they decided rates was widely seen as an attempt to interfere in their decision.

So it’s a great relief that the RBI stood firm. Its independence has been questioned of late, partly because of the circumstances in which Rajan left, under pressure from lawmakers in New Delhi, and partly because of its supine acceptance of the government’s controversial decision in November to withdraw 86% of India’s currency from circulation. The government should never have asked for the meeting; but, given that it did, the members of the MPC were right to refuse.

In any case, they knew what the government was likely to say: “Please, for the love of God, cut rates." India is confronting a growth slowdown that is born, most agree, out of a sustained crisis in private investment. It doesn’t take a meeting with the government for the MPC to know that. Yet it has ignored the pleas of officials—and of many in the private sector—and kept rates steady.

This determination emerges from another relatively recent reform: an agreement between the central bank and the government to shift to targeting consumer price inflation. A clear goal for the RBI—rather than a vague admonition that it should care about growth, prices and the exchange rate all at once—adds to its independence and clarifies its approach to monetary policy. But the government has grown increasingly frustrated. After all, not only is growth slowing, but the RBI has refused to reduce interest rates even as the inflation rate has fallen to historic lows.

Some argue that the MPC is simply ignoring or misreading the evidence. Even the RBI had to admit that its inflation forecast for the first quarter was off by an unusually large 1.4

<|begin_of_text|>"We cut our deficits by more than half."

In 2012, PolitiFact twice rated True claims that President Barack Obama failed to keep a promise to cut federal deficits in half by the end of his first term.

At that point, the budget gap topped a trillion bucks and Republican congressmen called out Obama because the deficit had been reduced by just 15 percent.

But there was the president at Laborfest 2014 in Milwaukee proclaiming "we cut our deficits by more than half."

In his Sept. 1, 2014 speech, the president ticked off for union supporters a list of major policy decisions he contends helped boost the economy and improve the government’s bottom line.

We can’t cover all of those here, but the deficit claim grabbed our attention.

Has it really been cut in half?

The White House Office of Management and Budget pointed us to a chart prepared by that office in 2013 as proof of Obama's claim.

It compares the yearly deficits under Obama, expressed -- as they often are -- as a share of the nation’s entire economy, which is measured by the Gross Domestic Product.

At the start of Obama’s term, the chart showed, the figure was 9.2 percent. The latest figure was 4.1 percent.

That appears to back Obama's statement.

But let's examine this in detail.

To do that, we reviewed figures published by the Congressional Budget Office as well as the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. We also consulted with independent fiscal experts.

The baseline year for comparison is fiscal year 2009, which ended Sept. 30 of that year. This was the last budget from President George W. Bush, as Obama took office in January of that year.

The most recent complete fiscal year is 2013.

Those are the same years Obama's chart showed.

Our analysis showed the drop easily topped 50 percent, and was actually somewhat higher than Obama's chart would indicate.

As a share of the economy, we found -- and our experts confirmed -- the drop was from 9.8 percent in 2009 to 4.1 percent in 2013.

Obama’s chart actually reflects a lower deficit figure for 2009, and therefore a lower share of GDP, 9.2%.

That’s because instead of using the actual 2009 deficit of $1.4 trillion, Obama lowers it by the $200 billion in increased deficit spending that he -- not Bush -- pushed through in the stimulus plan to address the crisis that became the

Approximately 5–15% of the fuel consumed by a typical car may be used to overcome rolling resistance.[1] A 2003 California Energy Commission (CEC) preliminary study estimated that adoption of low-rolling resistance tires could save 1.5–4.5% of all gasoline consumption, but that current data were also insufficient to compare safety and other characteristics.[2]

A United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) study in 2009 found that if 2% of the replacement tires would reduce their rolling resistance by 5%, there would be 7.9 million gallons fuel and 76,000 metric tons of CO2 saved annually.

(SAE J1269 and SAE J2452) performed on new tires.

Measuring rolling resistance in tires [ edit ]

Rolling resistance can be expressed by the rolling resistance coefficient (RRC or C rr ), which is the value of the rolling resistance force divided by the wheel load. A lower coefficient means the tires will use less energy to travel a certain distance. The coefficient is mostly considered as independent of speed, but for precise calculations it is tabled at several speeds or an additional speed-dependent part is used. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has developed test practices to measure the RRC of tires. These tests (SAE J1269 and SAE J2452) are usually performed on new tires.

When measured by using these standard test practices, most new passenger tires have reported RRCs ranging from 0.007 to 0.014.[3] In the case of bicycle tires, values of 0.0025 to 0.005 are achieved.[4] These coefficients are measured on rollers, with power meters on road surfaces, or with coast-down tests. In the latter two cases, the effect of air resistance must be subtracted or the tests performed at very low speeds. In 2009 The CEC used a rating called Rolling Resistance Force RRF. RRF and RRC, rolling resistance coefficient are very similar. Difference is taking the RRF and dividing it by the load(weight) to get RRC. So a Michelin Harmony tire rated at 9.45 RRF at 1000 pounds load would be.0095 RRC.[5][6]

<|begin_of_text|>U.S. may face deflation, a problem Japan understands too well

Economists worry that America could be edging closer to the trap that cost the other nation more than a decade of growth.

But soon, lower prices cut into business profits, and managers begin to trim payrolls. That in turn undermines consumers' buying power, leading to more pressure on profits, jobs and wages — as well as cutbacks in expansion and in the purchase of new plants and equipment.

When deflation begins, prices fall. At first that seems like a good thing.

And as Tokyo's experience suggests, deflation can be at least as tough a problem as the soaring prices of inflation or the financial pain of a traditional recession.

But increasingly, economists and other analysts are expressing concern that the United States could be edging closer to a different problem — the kind of deflationary trap that cost Japan more than a decade of growth and economic progress.

Reporting from Washington — The White House prediction Friday that the deficit would hit a record $1.47 trillion this year poured new fuel on the fiery argument over whether the government should begin cutting back to avoid future inflation or instead keep stimulating the economy to help the still-sputtering recovery.

Also, consumers who are financially able to buy often wait for still lower prices, adding to the deflationary trend.

All these factors feed on one another, setting off a downward spiral that can be as hard to escape from as a stall in an airplane.

For now, the dominant theme of the nation's economic policy debate remains centered on the comparative dangers of deficits and inflation. However, economists across the political spectrum — here and abroad — are talking more often about the potential for deflation.

So how likely is the problem?

The latest U.S. data are sobering: Consumer prices overall have declined in each of the last three months, putting the inflation index in June just 1.1% above a year earlier. The core inflation rate — a better gauge of where prices are going because it excludes volatile energy and food items — has dropped to a 44-year low of 0.9%.

That's well below the 1.5%-to-2% year-over-year inflation that the Federal Reserve likes to see, and some Fed policymakers have raised concerns about the rising risk of a broad decline in prices.

Private economists and financial experts have expressed much greater concern.

A bathtub, bath, or tub (informal) is a large or small container for holding water in which a person or animal may bathe. Most modern bathtubs are made of thermoformed acrylic, porcelain enameled steel, fiberglass-reinforced polyester, or porcelain enameled cast iron. A bathtub is usually placed in a bathroom either as a stand-alone fixture or in conjunction with a shower.

Modern bathtubs have overflow and waste drains and may have taps mounted on them. They are usually built-in, but may be free-standing or sometimes sunken. Until recently, most bathtubs were roughly rectangular in shape, but with the advent of acrylic thermoformed baths, more shapes are becoming available. Bathtubs are commonly white in colour, although many other colours can be found. The process for enamelling cast iron bathtubs was invented by the Scottish-born American David Dunbar Buick.

Two main styles of bathtub are common:

Western style bathtubs in which the bather lies down. These baths are typically shallow and long.

Eastern style bathtubs in which the bather sits up. These are known as furo in Japan and are typically short and deep.

History of bathtubs and bathing [ edit ]

Traditional bathtub (19th century) from Italy

Documented early plumbing systems for bathing go back as far as around 3300 BC with the discovery of copper water pipes beneath a palace in the Indus Valley Civilization of ancient India; see sanitation of the Indus Valley Civilization.[citation needed] Evidence of the earliest surviving personal sized bath tub was found on the Isle of Crete where a 1.5-metre (5 ft) long pedestal tub was found built from hardened pottery.[1]

The clawfoot tub, which reached the apex of its popularity in the late 19th century; had its origins in the mid 18th century, where the ball and claw design originated in Holland, possibly artistically inspired by the Chinese motif of a dragon holding a precious stone. The design spread to England where it found much popularity among the aristocracy, just as bathing was becoming increasingly fashionable. Early bathtubs in England tended to be made of cast iron, or even tin and copper with a face of paint applied that tended to peel with time.

In a wide-ranging interview with Postmedia this week, Chabot touted the “common man” appeal of his platform, pledged to change the tone at city hall, hold the line on municipal property tax increases to the consumer price index, and questioned the effectiveness of “handouts” for the city’s poorest.

“When we talk about helping the poor, and doing all of these social things, I don’t know that we’re actually doing them a service. I think we’re actually doing them more of a disservice by doing all these handouts,” he said.

“Hand-ups, to a certain degree, yes has some benefit,” Chabot said. “But struggle and success, I think, is just as valuable an education to help people become self-sufficient.”

Chabot’s own struggle, in his words, went something like this: He grew up on a farm in Saskatchewan. Moved to Calgary in 1971 and soon took a job in construction. Worked his way through DeVry while raising three kids with his wife, who also worked part-time.

“I did this on my own. I didn’t need to have somebody help me. If anything, it just encouraged me to even be better,” Chabot said.

“Now, if somebody would have said, ‘OK, well you can go on pogie (welfare) while you go to school,’ I would have been, ‘Heh, I can just sit back and have a couple of beers, I don’t have to work now.’ Would that have made me a better man? I don’t think so.”

In recent years, the city has made strides to make it easier for low-income Calgarians to access subsidized programs and services, such as recreation centre fee assistance, property tax assistance, basic home maintenance services for seniors and discounted transit passes through its Fair Entry program.

Applicants are only eligible for the subsidy if the entire household income is at or below Statistics Canada’s low-income cutoff (about $24,000 for a single person and $45,000 for a household of four).

Two months of sharp increases in food prices show grocers are starting to pass along their higher wholesale costs to consumers.

Retail food prices rose 0.4% in March, the same as in February and the largest amount since September 2011. By comparison, the prices of all consumer goods rose 0.2% in March and 0.1% the month before, reports the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Beverly Cabellon, 61, of Pleasant Hill, Calif., was taken aback by the $38 price for two steaks at Costco recently, up from the $27 she paid last September. "I will be grilling more vegetables and shrimp this summer," she says, adding that she and her husband will likely eat beef once a month instead of weekly. "And I may switch to pork and chicken."

Beef, pork, poultry, eggs and milk have had the most dramatic price increases as drought, a virus outbreak and rising exports have thinned U.S. supplies.

Overall consumer prices rose 0.2% in March, a bit more rapidly than in recent months, and annual inflation was 1.5%, up from 1.1% in February.

Annual inflation was 1.5% in March, up from 1.1% in February. That's well below the Federal Reserve's 2% target, as falling gasoline prices offset rising food costs.

But higher food bills are squeezing households still struggling with meager wage gains, and could crimp spending just as the recovery is expected to accelerate.

Cheryl Stewart, 38, of Perry Hall, Md., says higher prices for meat and milk have prompted her to drive 10 to 15 miles to grocery stores in low-income areas that carry more obscure brands at lower prices. She also spreads the food shopping for her family among three or four stores to get the best prices.

"Living standards will suffer as a larger percentage of household budgets are spent on grocery store bills, leaving less for discretionary spending," says economist Chris Christopher of IHS Global Insight.

Summary: We measure your Spending Skill as a league score, ranging from Bronze to Grandmaster. For each game you play, your Average Unspent Resources (AUR) and Income are combined into a single number (called Spending Quotient, also known as SQ). Your Spending Skill is based on typical SQ levels for your race, region (NA, EU, etc) and game length. As you can see from the Spending Skill Stats, long games tend to have lower SQs. For example, an SQ of 76 for an EU Protoss in a 27-minute game is a Grandmaster-level performance, but in a 7-minute game that same SQ is only Platinum level. and then similarity-checked against our Starcraft library of more than 100,000 1v1 ladder games.

There's an excellent article called Do you macro like a pro? which studies 2,100 games and proves that pros spend their resources better than noobs.

Spending can make a big difference. Let's say you and your enemy have the same income, and the same tech, but you have 1,000 unspent resources and she has 0. Then her army is going to be 1,000 resources bigger than yours. That's 20 extra marines. Assuming her micro skill is equal to yours, then she's going to win.

Don't let her win!!

After every game, the Score Screen shows your Average Unspent Resources (AUR). But that one number doesn't tell you if you did a good or bad job on spending.

An AUR of 1,000 is great when your Resource Collection Rate (aka Income) is 1,900, but it's not good when your Income is 400. So AUR alone isn't enough to know if your Spending was good.

Do you macro like a pro? introduced the idea of Spending Quotient (SQ), a formula that combines AUR and Income into a single score, usually between 40 and 100, that measures how well you're spending. It's a nice formula, it's even got a logarithm in it.

Here's a calculator you can use to play with the SQ formula.

Resource Collection Rate (Income) Average Unspent Resources Spending Quotient {{ sq }}

Grandmasters and pros get SQ around 100, and bronze leaguers get 40 or 50.

If you’ve ever tried to give yourself a haircut, you know just how hard it is to make something precisely symmetrical. We value symmetry so highly in part because it’s really hard to achieve.

Here are five of the most symmetrical objects humans have ever crafted, and why they were so hard to make.

Strikingly symmetrical pieces of ear jewelry, alleged to be centuries old, have been seized on by conspiracy theorists.

Gravity Probe B quartz gyroscope rotors

In 2004, Gravity Probe B (GP-B) was launched into space on a Delta II rocket with the mission of testing the theory of general relativity. The Earth-orbiting satellite included a set of gyroscopes that could measure two of the phenomena predicted by general relativity: the curvature of spacetime (the geodetic effect) and the distortion of spacetime by large objects (frame-dragging). In order to measure these things, the gyroscopes had to be incredible accurate. Being off by anything larger than one one-hundred-billionth of a degree every hour would ruin the experiment. Standard gyroscopes used on submarines and military aircraft, for comparison, are over 10 million times less accurate.

The key to building such an accurate gyroscope was creating perfectly symmetrical rotors, the quickly spinning elements that allow gyroscopes to maintain their orientation. These rotors had to be totally balanced, and completely homogenous inside as well. The GP-B team crafted these little spheres out of pure quartz blocks that were grown in Brazil and baked in Germany. The surface of each gyroscope is almost completely spherical, only about three ten-millionths of an inch away.

According to the Guinness Book of World Records, these are the roundest objects ever made. The Stanford team that worked on the spheres says only neutron stars are more spherical.

Avogadro Project silicon kilogram

Gravity Probe B’s only real contender, when it comes to perfect spheres, is the ball that should soon define a kilogram. This sphere is the result of The Avogadro Project, and its raw materials alone cost over a million dollars. The goal is to to supersede and replace the international prototype kilogram (IPK). The kilogram is the very last unit in the International System of Units (essentially, the metric system) that is still defined by a physical object—a cylinder made of platinum-iridium alloy—rather than physical principles.

Aid groups are accusing the Coalition of breaking an election commitment after it revealed their funding would be cut mid-year as part of a $650m reduction in the former government’s budgeted foreign aid spending, leaving 2013-14 spending $107m below what was spent last year.

Foreign minister Julie Bishop announced the cuts for the groups as well as a complete defunding of international environmental programs. The government is redirecting a pared back aid budget towards the region and maintenance of spending on countries such as Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and Nauru, whose co-operation is necessary for the success of its asylum policy.

Organisations such as Care, Save the Children, Caritas, ChildFund, Plan International and the Fred Hollows Foundation – who have partnership agreements with the government – have had their current year funding cut by about 8%.

They say that means they are losing money already allocated to programs related to water and sanitation, elimination of violence against women, disaster reduction work and small-scale agriculture, among others.

The organisations say the cuts clearly break a Coalition promise not to cut their funding when it announced a $4.5bn cut to the aid budget over the next four years two days before the federal election.

At the time of that cut, the then shadow treasurer, Joe Hockey, and shadow finance spokesman, Andrew Robb, said “the Coalition will reprioritise foreign aid allocations towards non-government organisations that deliver on-the-ground support for those most in need”.

“That will also mean putting more money into NGOs who are on the ground and who can deliver aid more efficiently than through AusAID or indeed through some of the multilaterals that we’ve been putting money into in increasing numbers because AusAID cannot handle the increases in the budget,” then foreign affairs spokeswoman Julie Bishop said.

The government said it needed to redirect the $4.5bn towards domestic infrastructure. The cut was from projected expenditure – with the aid budget continuing to grow in line with inflation.

“Under the previous Labor government, the rapid growth in Australia’s aid budget was neither targeted nor sustainable... This year’s aid expenditure will be $107m less than last year. From 2014-15 the $5bn aid budget will grow each year in line with the consumer price index,” Bishop said in a statement on Saturday, “confirming” the cuts after they were announced in the Australian newspaper.

The only recent year with a bigger percentage drop was in 2009, when America was in a large recession.

American cars and factories spewed 5.83 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2012, down from 6.06 billion in 2011. It is the lowest level for US emissions since 1994. Carbon dioxide is the chief man-made global warming gas.

Energy Department economist Perry Lindstrom said on MOnday that carbon pollution reduction was due to warm winter weather, more efficient cars because of new mileage requirements and an ongoing shift from coal power to natural gas to produce electricity.

The coal shift is a big factor as is a sluggish economic recovery, said Jay Apt, director of the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Centre. He said that in 1994 coal provided 52 per cent of the US power and now it was down to 37 per cent. Burning coal produces far more carbon dioxide than burning natural gas.

Some past cuts in carbon pollution were mostly due to economic factors, such as the 7.1 per cent drop in 2009, Lindstrom said.

But this drop happened while the US economy was growing 2.8 per cent, as reflected by the gross domestic product, and its energy use was dropping by more than 2 per cent.

Economists measure energy efficiency and how real reductions are in carbon pollution, by calculating carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP. And from 2011 to 2012, the United States carbon pollution per GDP dropped by a record 6.5 per cent, Lindstrom said.

That shows this drop was clearly not due to a recession, Lindstrom said.

"This latest drop in energy-related carbon emissions is reason for cautious optimism that we're already starting to move in the right direction," said Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann.

"But this alone will not lead us toward the dramatic carbon reductions necessary to avoid dangerous climate change."

The world is heading in the opposite direction. In 2011, the world carbon dioxide emissions jumped 3 per cent, because of a large increase by China, the number one carbon polluting country. The US is number two in carbon emissions.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

However, Christmas trees often take the blame for destructive fires that occur during the holiday season. The most effective way to prevent Christmas tree fires is to keep the tree well hydrated. With proper care, a tree should remain fresh for two to three weeks. This may sound easy, but it becomes a problem if your Christmas tree is not drinking water.

Causes for a Christmas Tree Not Taking Up Water

Generally, when Christmas trees have problems taking up water, it’s because we tend to add products to the tree itself or the water. Avoid spray-on fire retardants and other products advertised to keep your tree fresh. Similarly, bleach, vodka, aspirin, sugar, lime soda, copper pennies or vodka have little or no effect and some can actually slow water retention and increase moisture loss.

What works best? Plain old tap water. If you tend to be forgetful, keep a pitcher or watering can near the tree to remind you.

How to Get a Christmas Tree to Take Up Water

Cutting a thin sliver from the bottom of the trunk is key to keeping a tree fresh. Keep in mind that if the tree is freshly cut, you don’t need to cut the trunk. However, if the tree has been cut for longer than 12 hours before you put it in water, you must trim ¼ to ½ inch from the bottom of the trunk.

This is because the bottom of the trunk seals itself with sap after a few hours and can’t absorb water. Cut straight across and not at an angle; an angular cut makes it harder for the tree to take up water. It is also difficult to get a tree with an angular cut to stand upright. Also, don’t drill a hole in the trunk. It doesn’t help.

Next, a large stand is critical; a Christmas tree can drink up to one quart of water for each inch of stem diameter. The National Christmas Tree Association recommends a stand with a one-gallon capacity. Never trim the bark to accommodate a too-tight stand. The bark helps the tree take up water.

Christmas Tree Watering Tips

Start with a fresh Christmas tree. There’s no way to hydrate a dried up tree, even if you trim the bottom. If you aren’t sure about freshness, pull a branch slowly through your fingers. A few dry needles are no reason for concern, but look for a fresher tree if a large number of needles are loose or brittle.

A campaign spokeswoman for Villaraigosa pointed us to 2015 GDP figures from the International Monetary Fund.

We used the same data in July to verify that California, with a GDP of nearly $2.5 trillion, had the sixth-largest economy behind the United States, China, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom.

California Gov. Jerry Brown’s administration released GDP figures in June showing the state had jumped two spots in these unique world rankings ahead of France and Brazil and into sixth place behind the United Kingdom.

In our July fact check, we noted that when adjusted for California’s very high cost of living, the state’s GDP drops several places. This led us to our Mostly True rating for the claim, which we define as "accurate but needs clarification or additional information."

To come up with a combined GDP for three West Coast states, we

<|begin_of_text|>"You must be the only person worried about inflation, Liam". So I was told on Newsnight last week – by someone who's spent four of the last five years in the cabinet.

Almost lost for words, I blurted an answer before Mr Paxman intervened.

But I left the television studio shocked that the former minister, someone of genuine ability, could be so ignorant of life beyond the Westminster village.

"Inflation, not deflation" is a recurrent theme of this column. That's because the Western world's response to the "credit crunch", this orgy of wildly expansive policy using "deflation is nigh" as an alibi, amounts to a repeated whacking of the self-destruct button.

Almost everyone outside the "political and media elite" knows this. Amidst "deflation is upon us" warnings from this elite, UK CPI inflation went up last month – to 3.2pc. CPI understates true inflation. But even CPI is above the Bank of England's target – and has been for 17 months.

So if I'm the only one worried, why is Mervyn King writing repeated letters acknowledging inflation is too high?

Sterling is down a third in 18 months. Import prices are soaring. The UK's monetary base is doubling.

"Broad" M4 money is expanding at 16pc a year. Food price inflation is 8pc, with double-digit producer price inflation too – as the credit crunch destroys supply chains.

Warren Buffett, the most successful living investor, foresees an "inflation onslaught". Peter Brabeck, the Nestlé chairman and one of the world's top businessmen, says "Now the printing machine is starting, this is the start of inflation."

China and other major creditors are rightly concerned Western governments – particularly the US and UK – want to inflate away their sovereign debts.

That's why the "bond vigilantes" are stirring and we could very soon face a gilts strike.

If I'm the only one worried about inflation, why is the price of gold so high, with the price of commodities also up sharply – even though the global demand outlook is weak?

If I'm the only one worried about inflation, why does the latest report of the Bank of England's pension scheme show it recently changed it allocation of index-linked instruments – the ultimate anti-inflation hedge – from 25pc to more than 70pc of its portfolio?

Am I the only one worried? I so wish that was true. We face an inflation tsunami. And

For the first time, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis released price-adjusted estimates of personal income for states and metropolitan areas for 2008 to 2012, and it shows that, at the very least, it’s more expensive for Members of Congress to live in the nation’s capital on their $174,000 salary than in any state from which they hail.

The results show the District of Columbia, in 2012, had the highest “regional price parity” of any state. Granted, D.C.’s really a city, not a state, and set against their more natural comparisons, it ranks fifth, behind the Urban Honolulu area, New York-Newark-Jersey City, San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk and San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward. Beaches, hedge funds and technology are the key to prices, evidently.

The cheapest metro areas, by this methodology, were Danville, Ill.; Jefferson City, Mo.; Jackson, Tenn.; Jonesboro, Ark.; and Rome, Ga.

See related look at most and least expensive cities to live in the U.S.

Put another way,it costs 54% more to live in Honolulu than in Danville.

The top five states (outside of D.C.) were Hawaii, New York, New Jersey, California and Maryland, and the bottom five states were Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Missouri and South Dakota. So, it costs 36% more to live in Hawaii than in Mississippi.

The BEA says it produced the report in large part so people and businesses can have a better understanding how their personal income may be impacted by a job change or move. There is regional consumer price index data, but those statistics aren’t designed for regional or city comparisons, whereas this data is, a spokesman says.

<|begin_of_text|>From the Kansas City Fed: Tenth District Manufacturing Activity Strengthened Further

The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City released the March Manufacturing Survey today. According to Chad Wilkerson, vice president and economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, the survey revealed that Tenth District manufacturing activity strengthened further with strong expectations for future activity.

“Our composite index accelerated again, and has only been higher one time in the last 15 years,” said Wilkerson. “The future employment index was the strongest in the 23-year history of the survey."

...

The month-over-month composite index was 20 in March, its highest reading since March 2011, up from 14 in February and 9 in March. The composite index is an average of the production, new orders, employment, supplier delivery time, and raw materials inventory indexes. Activity in both durable and nondurable goods plants increased, particularly for metals, computer, electronic, and aircraft products. Most month-over-month indexes rose further in March. The production and shipments indexes increased considerably, while the new orders and order backlog indexes rose more moderately but remained high. The employment index moderated slightly from 17 to 13, and the new orders for exports index also eased. Both inventory indexes increased for the second straight month.

emphasis added

The Kansas City region was hit hard by the decline in oil prices, but activity is expanding solidly again. The regional Fed surveys released so far suggest another strong reading for the ISM manufacturing index for March.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Everyone knows that the “genuine designer handbag” going for $20 from a street vendor is neither genuine nor designer, and indeed may not even hold up as a bag. But when you go to a reputable retailer and spend what it costs to replace the tires on your car, you expect to get what the real goods. Alas, Consumer Reports has found: just because there’s a brand name you know on the outside of a tire, doesn’t mean you’re getting what you should be.

Consumer Reports (our parent organization) discovered the counterfeit tires while conducting otherwise routine tire performance tests. One tire brand, American Pacific Industries’ Pegasus Advanta for SUVs, performed very poorly in the tests and received a low rating.

The company then contacted Consumer Reports to ask about the way the tires were tested and to ask which batch CR had used.

That’s when the story gets interesting. It turned out that the tires being sold under API’s Pegasus brand were not what they appeared to be. The legally required date codes stamped into the tires indicated they had been made for API in a specific Chinese factory in August and December 2012.

To which API replied: “American Pacific Industries’ relationship with this factory ended in 2011 [and] our records indicate the last shipment of these tires in the SUV pattern was in December of 2011.”

Further, API said, the factory had been destroyed after that contract concluded, and many of their molds went missing. “We have no idea who may have made these tires nor what they put in them,” the company’s COO told Consumer Reports.

Counterfeit tires pose two big challenges for consumers. One is that their quality may be lacking — as these were — and consumers aren’t getting what they paid for. And the other challenge is that in the event of a safety defect or a recall, consumers don’t really have any recourse.

Ordinarily, if there is a safety complaint about tires the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issues a recall and the manufacturer has to replace the item. But if the problem with the item is that the manufacturer did not in fact actually manufacture them… then who would be responsible for a recall? It’s not an action that NHTSA could actually take.

But there are federal actions available. It turns out that counterfeited imported goods fall under the purview of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. An ICE official told Consumer Reports, that if counterfeit tires are being made and smuggled, “We would investigate and try to mount an interdiction and

<|begin_of_text|>Should we expect prices to fall all the way back? Well, in the late 1980s, Los Angeles experienced a large localized housing bubble: real home prices rose about 50 percent before the bubble popped. Home prices then proceeded to fall by a quarter, which combined with ongoing inflation brought real housing prices right back to their prebubble level.

And here’s the thing: this process took more than five years — L.A. home prices didn’t bottom out until the mid-1990s. If the current housing slump runs on the same schedule, we won’t be seeing a recovery until 2011 or later.

What about the broader economy? You might be tempted to take comfort from the fact that the last two recessions, in 1990-1991 and 2001, were both quite short. But in each case, the official end of the recession was followed by a long period of sluggish economic growth and rising unemployment that felt to most Americans like a continued recession.

Photo

Thus, the 1990 recession officially ended in March 1991, but unemployment kept rising through much of 1992, allowing Bill Clinton to win the election on the basis of the economy, stupid. The next recession officially began in March 2001 and ended in November, but unemployment kept rising until June 2003.

These prolonged recession-like episodes probably reflect the changing nature of the business cycle. Earlier recessions were more or less deliberately engineered by the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates to control inflation. Modern slumps, by contrast, have been hangovers from bouts of irrational exuberance — the savings and loan free-for-all of the 1980s, the technology bubble of the 1990s and now the housing bubble.

Ending those old-fashioned recessions was easy because all the Fed had to do was relent. Ending modern slumps is much more difficult because the economy needs to find something to replace the burst bubble.

Yet few people today are familiar with the majority of tales from the two early volumes, since in the next four decades the Grimms would publish six other editions, each extensively revised in content and style. For the very first time, ” The Original Folk and Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm” makes available in English all 156 stories from the 1812 and 1815 editions. These narrative gems, newly translated and brought together in one beautiful book, are accompanied by sumptuous new illustrations from award-winning artist Andrea Dezso.

From “The Frog King” to “The Golden Key,” wondrous worlds unfold–heroes and heroines are rewarded, weaker animals triumph over the strong, and simple bumpkins prove themselves not so simple after all. Esteemed fairy tale scholar Jack Zipes offers accessible translations that retain the spare description and engaging storytelling style of the originals. Indeed, this is what makes the tales from the 1812 and 1815 editions unique–they reflect diverse voices, rooted in oral traditions, that are absent from the Grimms’ later, more embellished collections of tales. Zipes’s introduction gives important historical context, and the book includes the Grimms’ prefaces and notes.

The source material for Children’s and Household Tales was originally collected from books as well as friends and acquaintances in and around Kassel, Hesse in what is now Germany as well as Westphalia for the romantic poet Clemens Brentano between 1806 and 1812. Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm eventually came to distinguish between the Naturpoesie of the German Volk and the Kuntspoesie, or cultivated literature, which arose from and subsumed it. Ultimately, Brentano found the collected tales unsuitable toward his purposes and gave the brothers his blessing to do with them as they pleased. The first edition of Kinder- und Hausmärchen was published in 1812.

While even those tales were edited in order to create something more than a skeletal fragment of a story, they are generally representative of local traditions. The Grimms explained in their introduction (included)

Their reluctance is well-founded. It is beginning to dawn on even the more optimistic analysts that the tepid growth we have seen over the past three quarters is only an interlude in an otherwise grave and prolonged recession. Moreover, the respite will cost dearly as the United States has racked up a generation worth of debt for dubious benefit.

The paltry number of new jobs currently being created still fall far short of the 375,000 per month needed to offset the 125,000 new entrants to the job market due to population growth and to erode the 8 million people laid off in the past year alone. Meanwhile, house prices continue to fall and credit continues to contract. With retail sales dropping in June and the Leading Economic Index (LEI) standing at minus 7.7 per cent, it should be clear that the US economy is heading back towards recession, following a temporary distortion created by some $1.3 trillion in federal stimulus. In short, the stimulus has failed.

While there can be no doubt that an increase in government spending will result in a boost to GDP figures, the evidence of history shows that such growth is short-lived. Unfortunately as leaders around the world look to tighten the reins on out of control spending, President Obama and his Democratic supporters in Congress believe that their stimulus actions have succeeded and should be redoubled. Armed with nothing more than faith in government and a belief that spending is both a means and an end, it appears that the US stimulus policy will continue. The net result of these efforts will not be a more vibrant economy, but the perpetuation of fear and confusion in the business community and the continuing expansion of deficits that will lead inevitably to higher taxes.

The more indebted an economy becomes, the greater the burden that must be borne by the wealth-creating private sector. Indeed, at the present rate of government debt-financing, the private sector will have to contribute some $2 trillion each year in interest costs alone. This money must be raised by taxation or inflation.

This week, in response to their fears of increased regulations, higher taxes, and greater government stewardship of the economy, discontent among business leaders flared into the open. Gathering in Washington, leaders of the US Chamber of Commerce lashed out at current regulatory changes in healthcare.

The MAOIs in B. caapi allow the primary psychoactive compound, DMT (which is introduced from the other primary ingredient in ayahausca, the Psychotria viridis plant), to be orally active.

The name ayahuasca means "vine of the soul"and the shamans of the indigenous western Amazonian tribes use the plant in religious and healing ceremonies. In addition to its hallucinogenic properties, caapi is used for its healing properties as a purgative, effectively cleansing the body of parasites and helping the digestive tract.

Harmala alkaloids are short term yet powerful MAOIs which render tryptamines orally active by temporarily reducing levels of monoamine oxidase in the body which otherwise rapidly destroys them. Their effects are more powerful and less toxic than pharmaceutical SSRIs since they do not lead to suicidal tendencies and other side effects which detrimentally affect human behavior.

The principal ayahuasca compounds have a common indole structure which, through several mechanisms, influences certain functions of the central nervous system (CNS). The relevant factor is the biochemical similarity of these compounds to the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT). The harmala alkaloids in ayahuasca, primarily harmine and tetrahydroharmine, reversibly inhibit the neuronal enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO).

This allows DMT to be active when ingested orally. It also facilitates accumulation of biogenic amines, such as 5-HT, which are normally metabolized by monoamine oxidase enzymes. DMT is a naturally-occurring biochemical substance secreted by the human body in the pineal gland. It occurs in hundreds of plant species worldwide. It can produce very powerful visionary effects when smoked in its pure form or taken orally in Ayahuasca.

The Ayahuasca Experience

People who have consumed ayahuasca report having spiritual revelations regarding their purpose on earth, the true nature of the universe as well as deep insight into how to be the best person they possibly can. This is viewed by many as a spiritual awakening and what is often described as a rebirth. In addition it is often reported that individuals can gain access to higher spiritual dimensions and make contact with various spiritual or extra dimensional beings who can act as guides or healers.

—Abraham Lincoln, from his first speech as an Illinois state legislator, 1837

Everyone now is more or less a Socialist.

—Charles Dana, managing editor of the New York Tribune, and Lincoln’s assistant secretary of war, 1848

The workingmen of Europe feel sure that, as the American War of Independence initiated a new era of ascendancy for the middle class, so the American Antislavery War will do for the working classes. They consider it an earnest of the epoch to come that it fell to the lot of Abraham Lincoln, the single-minded son of the working class, to lead his country through the matchless struggle for the rescue of an enchained race and the reconstruction of a social world.

—Karl Marx and the First International Workingmen’s Association to Lincoln, 1864

ON DECEMBER 3, 1861, a former one-term congressman, who had spent most of the past dozen years studying dissident economic theories, mounting challenges to the existing political order and proposing ever more radical responses to the American crisis, delivered his first State of the Union address as the sixteenth president of the United States.

Since assuming office eight months earlier, this new president had struggled, without success, first to restore the severed bonds of the Union and then to avert a wrenching civil war. Now, eleven southern slave states were in open and violent rebellion against the government he led.

His inaugural address of the previous spring had closed with a poignant reflection on the prospect of eventual peace, imagining a day when the Union might again be touched “by the better angels of our nature.” But, now, in the last month of what Walt Whitman would recall as America’s “sad, distracted year”—“Year that suddenly sang by the mouths of the round-lipp’d cannons”—the better angels seemed to have deserted the continent. Every effort to restore the republic had been thwarted. There was no room for accommodation with the Confederate States of America. Fort Sumter had been fired upon and the flag of southern rebellion now flew above Charleston Harbor. Virginia, the cradle of presidents, the state of Washington, Jefferson and Madison, had joined the revolt and assembled a capital of the Confederacy less than 100 miles from Washington. Hundreds of Union and Confederate soldiers had died, with thousands more wounded at the First Battle of Bull Run. Armies had been reorganized and generals replaced with the recognition that this was no skirm

Half of this oil is to come from the SPR of the United States; the rest is to come from SPRs of other members of OECD.

Both the amount and the timing of the release are strange. The amount of the release is equivalent to 2 million barrels a day. This is actually more than the Libyan disruption took off the market, which was about 1.4 million barrels a day. The disruption first took place in February, and oil prices have been declining since early May, so the timing is strange, as well.

What the timing of the oil release is close to, is the end of Quantitative Easing 2 (QE2). QE2 is the United States’ program of buying back debt to keep interest rates low and the dollar low, which began November 2010 and is scheduled to end June 30, 2011. It was intended to stimulate the economy, and oil prices have indeed risen during most of the time it was in effect.

Today’s announcement of the SPR oil-release program was made by IEA, but a person can’t help but wonder if the United States wasn’t heavily involved in the decision. After all, the United States is the largest member of the IEA, and is making half the release itself. Also, when Ben Bernanke spoke yesterday, he didn’t have any financial replacement for QE2. The release of oil from the SPR looks as if it is the latest attempt to kick-start the economy, both of the US and other OECD countries, using yet another approach.

If we look at oil price and the S&P 500 Index (Figure 2), there has been a significant correlation between the two since late 2008. When oil prices drop, so does the S&P 500 Index, most likely since this means the economy is “tanking.” When oil prices rise, so does the S&P 500 Index, indicating the economy is working well.

The problem is that high oil prices soon sow the seed of their own destruction. Once the oil price starts getting high (over $85 is high, over $110 is very high), the high oil prices start causing recessionary influences, because citizens have to cut back on other goods, when oil and food prices start rising.

* * *

A little before 10 a.m. on the morning of December 4, Peter Davi drove his Ford F-150 along the 17 Mile Drive in Carmel-by-the-Sea, a quaint town bordering Monterey in Northern California. His friend Osh Bartlett, known as Frog, sat beside him. Through the window they smelled the pine and cut grass wafting from the farms and gentlemen’s ranches up in Carmel Valley. Davi watched with a flicker of disdain as a parade of Audis, Lexuses, and the occasional Ferrari sped past. As the other drivers stopped to buy skim lattes at Carmel Valley Coffee, Davi and Frog passed the Pebble Beach Golf Links, turned right onto Cypress Drive, and pulled into the parking lot at Still­water Cove—already filled with pickups hitched to empty waverunner trailers.

Outside it was cool and misty—mid-50s and rising. A 10-knot breeze blew out of the north, swirling the loose, dark curls on Davi’s head. Tourists come thousands of miles to eye this stretch of picturesque coast, with its rocky shoreline and lush cypress trees. But to Davi, a lifelong local, it was the sound that struck him that morning. In the parking lot at Stillwater Cove he could hear Ghost Tree like he’d never heard it before. It was the sound of 70-foot waves—surely record size—detonating onto the boulder field at Pescadero Point.

Davi was a massive, intimidating man. Considered the unofficial mayor of this legendary surfing community, he’d earned widespread respect over the years among elite surfers by launching himself into the largest, most terrifying waves in California and Hawaii. He knew every break in Big Sur. He had a ruddy, wind-swept face and dulled dark eyes. He stood 6'2" and weighed close to 250 pounds. When he pulled a 4/3-millimeter wet suit over his body, along with a hood and gloves, his paunch was visible. He grabbed his 8'5" surfboard—a “gun” suitable for paddle surfing but too long for this dangerous tow-in scene. At 45 he walked as if in constant pain, as though the cartilage in his knees had been worn away.

Creating an animation in JavaScript is one of the simplest things you can do. If you’ve ever tried to do it, you’ll most likely have used either the setTimeout or setInterval functions.

Here’s a typical example:

function draw ( ) { // Drawing code goes here } setInterval ( draw, 100 ) ;

This piece of code will call the draw function once every 100ms forever and ever, until at some point later the clearInterval function is called. An alternative to this code is to use a setTimeout function instead, this time inside the draw function:

function draw ( ) { setTimeout ( draw, 100 ) ; // Drawing code goes here } draw ( ) ;

The single call to the draw function kicks off the animation loop, and from then on it will call itself repeatedly every 100ms.

Frame rate and setInterval

The smoothness of your animation depends on the frame rate of your animation. Frame rate is measured in frames per second (fps). Film usually runs at 24fps, video at 30fps. The higher this number is, the smoother your animation will look…to a point. More frames, means more processing, which can often cause stuttering and skipping. This is what is meant by the term dropping frames. Because most screens have a refresh rate of 60Hz, the fastest frame rate you should aim for is 60fps. Time for some math!

/** * 1s = 1000ms (remember that setInterval and setTimeout run on milliseconds) * 1000ms / 60(fps) = 16.7ms (we'll round this to 17) */ // Lights, camera…function! setInterval ( function ( ) { animateEverything ( ) ; }, 17 ) ;

What’s wrong with setTimeout and setInterval?

OK, you’ve done this a million times before. What’s wrong with this picture? Well, a few things. Firstly, setTimeout doesn’t take into account what else is happening in the browser. The page could be hidden behind a tab, hogging your CPU when it doesn’t need to, or the animation itself could have been scrolled off the page making the update call again unnecessary. Chrome does throttle setInterval and setTimeout to 1fps in hidden tabs, but this isn’t to be relied upon for all browsers.

Secondly, setTimeout only updates the screen when it wants to, not when the computer is able to. That means your poor browser has to juggle redrawing the animation whilst redrawing the whole screen

<|begin_of_text|>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Add another economic worry to inflation and deflation: ecoflation, the rising cost of doing business in a world with a changing climate.

Ecoflation could hit consumer goods hard in the next five to 10 years, according to a report by World Resources Institute and A.T. Kearney, a global management consulting firm.

Companies that make fast-moving consumer goods, everything from cereal to shampoo, could see earnings drop by 13 percent to 31 percent by 2013 and 19 percent to 47 percent by 2018 if they do not adopt sustainable environmental practices, the report said.

The costs of global warming are showing up now in the form of worse heat waves, droughts, wildfires and possibly more severe tropical storms but they are not yet reflected in consumer prices, said the institute’s Andrew Aulisi after the report’s December 2 release.

Instead, these costs are paid by governments and society, Aulisi said in a telephone interview. That could change if President-elect Barack Obama and the U.S. Congress push for a system that puts a price on the emission of climate-warming carbon dioxide, Aulisi said.

This is unlikely to happen next year in time for a December 2009 deadline to craft an international pact to fight climate change but it is more likely to happen in 2010.

These rising costs and possible tightening regulation of greenhouse gas emissions are not necessarily a bad thing, he said.

“The message we don’t see in this study is that regulation is going to cost... a lot of money,” Aulisi said. “We think the analysis is a catalyst to convince companies to take greater action on these important issues.”

LESS PLASTIC

In fact, some companies are already looking at ways to cut their emissions in advance of any new regulation, said Daniel Mahler of A.T. Kearney.

One example is consumer giant Procter & Gamble, which has a team looking across the company’s varied laundry, hair-care and health-care businesses to see how they can use less plastic, a fossil-based material, Mahler said by telephone.

But the changes may need to go deeper and wider, he said, spreading to the basics of how supply chains are managed.

For instance, companies that presumed U.S. transportation costs would be low and U.S. labor costs would be high had their goods made in countries where employees would work for less. But a new cost to the carbon emitted by long-distance transport could change that equation, making foreign manufacturing less attractive,

Alejandro Justiniano, Giorgio Primiceri, Andrea Tambalotti

There is no consensus among economists on the forces that drove the historical rise of US house prices and household debt that preceded the Global Crisis. In this column, the authors argue that the fundamental factor behind that boom was an increase in the supply of mortgage credit. This rise was brought about by the diffusion of securitisation and shadow banking, and by a surge in foreign capital inflows. The finding is based on a straightforward interpretation of four key macroeconomic developments between 2000 and 2006, provided by a simple general equilibrium model of housing and credit.

The Global Crisis precipitated the worst US recession since the Great Depression. The spectacular rise in house prices and household debt during the first half of the 2000s, which is illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, was a crucial factor behind these events. Yet, economists disagree on the fundamental causes of this credit and housing boom.

Figure 1. Real house prices

Notes: FHFA is the all-transactions house price index from the Federal Housing and Financing Agency. CoreLogic is the repeated sales national house price index produced by CoreLogic. Both indexes are deflated by the headline consumer price index, and normalized to 100 in 2000Q1.

Figure 2. Household mortgages-to-GDP ratio

Notes: Household mortgages are nominal home mortgages from the balance sheet of households and nonprofit organizations in the Flow of Funds. GDP is in current prices from the NIPA tables.

The higher loan-to-value ratio hypothesis

The most common narrative in the macroeconomic literature attributes the surge in debt and house prices to a progressive loosening of collateral requirements for mortgage borrowers, such as those brought about by the diffusion of mortgages with higher initial loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, of multiple mortgages on the same property, and of home equity lines of credit.

Several recent papers use quantitative general equilibrium models to explore the implications of these less stringent collateral requirements for house prices and other macroeconomic outcomes (e.g. Favilukis et al. 2013, Bianchi et al. 2012, Boz and Mendoza 2014, Garriga et al. 2012). In all of these models, a collateral constraint limits households' ability to borrow to a fraction of the value of their real estate. When this maximum loan-to-value ratio is relaxed, households can increase their leverage and borrow more. As a result, the demand

For the agricultural and industrial processes for producing whole coffee beans, see Coffee processing

Filter coffee being brewed

Coffee preparation is the process of turning coffee beans into a beverage. While the particular steps vary with the type of coffee and with the raw materials, the process includes four basic steps: raw coffee beans must be roasted, the roasted coffee beans must then be ground, the ground coffee must then be mixed with hot water for a certain time (brewed), and finally the liquid coffee must be separated from the used grounds.

Coffee is usually brewed immediately before drinking. In most areas, coffee may be purchased unprocessed, or already roasted, or already roasted and ground. Coffee is often vacuum packed to prevent oxidation and lengthen its shelf life.

Roasting [ edit ]

Dutch coffee-roasting machine, c. 1920

Roasting coffee transforms the chemical and physical properties of green coffee beans. When roasted, the green coffee bean expands to nearly double its original size, changing in color and density. As the bean absorbs heat, its color shifts to yellow, then to a light "cinnamon" brown, and then to a rich dark brown color. During roasting, oils appear on the surface of the bean. The roast will continue to darken until it is removed from the heat source.

Coffee can be roasted with ordinary kitchen equipment (frying pan, grill, oven, popcorn popper) or by specialised appliances. A coffee roaster is a special pan or apparatus suitable to heat up and roast green coffee beans.

Grinding [ edit ]

An old-fashioned manual burr-mill coffee grinder

Wheel coffee grinder

Coffee grinder

The whole coffee beans are ground, also known as milling, to facilitate the brewing process.

The fineness of the grind strongly affects brewing. Brewing methods that expose coffee grounds to heated water for longer require a coarser grind than faster brewing methods. Beans that are too finely ground for the brewing method in which they are used will expose too much surface area to the heated water and produce a bitter, harsh, "over-extracted" taste. At the other extreme, an overly coarse grind will produce weak coffee unless more is used. Due to the importance of a grind's fineness, a uniform grind is highly desirable.

If a brewing method is used in which the time of exposure of the ground coffee to the heated water is adjustable, then a short brewing time can be used for finely ground coffee. This produces coffee of equal flavor yet uses less ground coffee. A blade grinder does not

Critical is the highest level possible in the UK and means that an attack is “expected imminently”.

The threat level is decided by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC). The last time it reached critical was in 2007, having been severe since 2014.

Prime Minister Theresa May said that the decision had been made following investigations today.

“It has now been concluded that the threat levels should be increased for the time being.

“This means that [the JTAC's] assessment is not only that an attack is highly likely, but that another attack is imminent

“It is a possibility we cannot ignore that there is a wider group of individuals linked to this attack.”

May added that military personnel will be deployed to Britain’s streets to support armed police officers under Operation Tempora.

Armed personnel will be visible at big events such as concerts and sporting events, she said.

Attack

The move comes as 22 people were confirmed dead after last night’s suicide bomb attack on an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester.

Manchester police identified the suspect behind the attack as 22-year-old Salman Abedi.

Police staged an armed raid on a Manchester address believed to be where Abedi lived, carrying out a controlled explosion to gain entry after arresting a 23-year-old man earlier Tuesday in connection with the attack.

“A single terrorist detonated his improvised explosive device near one of the exits of the venue, deliberately choosing the time and place to cause maximum carnage and to kill and injure indiscriminately,” May said after an emergency ministerial meeting.

The attack was the deadliest in Britain since July 7, 2005 when four suicide bombers inspired by Al-Qaeda attacked London’s transport system during rush hour, killing 52 people and wounding 700 more.

<|begin_of_text|>This post will mark the beginning of a series on Steve Keen’s book Debunking Economics. My first impression after reading his book was that it was chalk full of great ideas and solid criticisms of “neoclassical” economics as it is currently taught to undergraduate and graduate students. I’m not always fond of Keen’s tone, but isn’t some crank. I’m writing these posts in order to better retain the ideas and concepts expressed in the book, as well as to spark discussion. Other bloggers have also written about and summarized this book, and I will be linking to these posts as well. I’ll say that I don’t really have anything new to add to what has been perviously said, and I am doing this for my benefit.

Keen’s begins his criticism of neoclassical (micro) economics in chapter 3, which centers around the “Law of Demand”, i.e. the idea that market demand curves don’t necessarily slope downwards. This is in direct contrast to what is taught in an “Intro to Microeconomics” course, and subsequent economic courses use the assumption when explaining other concepts.

Market Demand Curves Don’t Slope Downwards

Economists look at demand curves to see how demand for a commodity changes as its price changes, while the consumer’s income remains constant. When you don’t make that assumption, things get complicated quickly. The decrease of price in one good raises the real income of the consumer (the income effect), allowing the consumer to increase the consumption of all goods, not just the good that has become cheaper. So in the case of Giffen Goods, because the rise in price of one good make another good unaffordable, you have a paradox where demand increases as prices rise. Consider necessary, luxury, and normal goods, and you have a very complicated picture and some interesting looking demand curves.

This is why economists make the distinction between the income effect and the substitution effect (if price falls, consumption rises and vice versa). The substitution effect is always negative and it’s what economists use to establish the “Law of Demand”. However, the income effect can be both negative and positive. So economists neutralize the income effect by using a Hicksian compensated demand function. The consumer is given a level of utility and a set of prices. The consumer then minimizes the amount of money that he/she would need to spend to achieve that given level of utility, thus separating the income effect and the substitution effect.

But once you introduce more than one agent into

<|begin_of_text|>By Indiaspend As many as 45 of India’s top 50 districts that offer affordable, formal financial services are in four south Indian states—with 30 concentrated in Tamil Nadu and Kerala—according to CRISIL Inclusix, a measure of financial inclusion. The top five states/union territories are Puducherry, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Goa and Chandigarh. These states drove a surge in India’s financial inclusion index, which improved to 50.1 (of a possible 100) at the end of 2013 from 42.8 at the end of 2012. The index does not take into account the Prime Minister’s Jan Dhan Yojana (People’s Wealth Scheme). With over 140 million new bank accounts opened since August 2014, the index will likely be boosted further in 2015. CRISIL, a Mumbai-based ratings agency, defines financial inclusion as “the extent of access by all sections of society to formal financial services such as credit, deposit, insurance and pension services”. CRISIL’s Inclusix is a relative index that combines three parameters of basic financial services—branch penetration, deposit penetration and credit penetration. A score of 100 indicates the ideal state for each of the three parameters. CRISIL has included district-wise data from micro-finance institutions (MFIs) to calculate the index for the first time, covering 652 districts in 35 states and union territories. Bank Services Are Spreading As many as 117 million savings bank accounts were opened in the financial year 2013, almost 50% more than the 79 million that opened the previous year. The total operative bank accounts in the country at the end of 2013 were 820 million as against 703 million in 2012, an increase of 17%, the fastest growth in four years. However, growth in credit accounts declined due to a reduction in small-borrower accounts to 102 million in 2013 from 109 million in 2012. “The decline was primarily observed in five metro districts: Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Mumbai Suburban and Bangalore Urban. This could be attributed to book-cleaning exercises by banks and closure of dormant credit-card accounts,” the report said. South leads; North-East at bottom but moves ahead With an increase of 40% in bank credit accounts, the northern state of Jammu & Kashmir saw its Inclusix score improve to 45.2.

The price of bitcoin topped $11,000 on Wednesday less than a day after passing the $10,000 mark and has increased more than 10-fold in value so far this year, prompting concerns of a bubble.

CME Group, the world’s largest derivatives exchange, and CBOE Holdings, have both said they plan to launch futures products based on bitcoin this year, pending regulatory approval, helping fuel the crypto-currency’s rally.

While Nasdaq does not have a hard date set for its product, the transatlantic exchange operator has offered an exchange-traded note based on bitcoin on its Stockholm exchange since 2015.

Nasdaq has teamed up with New York-based money manager VanEck to develop the futures contract, which will be cleared by the Options Clearing Corporation. The OCC clears all Nasdaq futures products, the source said.

VanEck had applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this year to launch a bitcoin-related exchange-traded fund, but withdrew the request in September after speaking with SEC staff, according to a regulatory filing.

The SEC requested that VanEck wait until the underlying instruments in which the ETF planned to primarily invest - bitcoin futures contracts - become available for investment, the filing said.

A representative for VanEck was not immediately available for comment.

One of the ways the Nasdaq futures product will differ from CME’s and CBOE’s is that it will be based on an index that takes in prices from more than 50 bitcoin exchanges, the source said.

CME has said it’s bitcoin future will be based on the CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR), a once-a-day reference rate of the U.S. dollar price of bitcoin, that currently takes prices from four bitcoin exchanges. CBOE will price its bitcoin future off the Gemini Trust, the digital currency exchange founded by brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

The SEC in March denied a request for CBOE to list what would have been the first U.S. ETF built to track bitcoin.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Singapore has topped 131 cities globally to become the world's most expensive city to live in 2014, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).

The city's strong currency combined with the high cost of running a car and soaring utility bills contributed to Singapore topping the list.

It is also the most expensive place in the world to buy clothes.

Singapore replaces Tokyo, which topped the list in 2013.

Other cities making up the top five most expensive cities to live in are Paris, Oslo, Zurich and Sydney, with Tokyo falling to sixth place.

The EIU's Worldwide Cost of Living Survey is a relocation tool that uses New York city as a base. It looks at more than 400 individual prices.

Soaring Asia

The top 10 cities this year have been dominated by Asian and Australasian cities as well as some in Europe.

"Improving sentiment in structurally expensive European cities combined with the continued rise of Asian hubs means that these two regions continue to supply most of the world's most expensive cities," said the editor of the report, Jon Copestake.

"But Asian cities also continue to make up many of the world's cheapest, especially in the Indian subcontinent."

Most Asian cities that top the list are there for predominantly higher costs of groceries. Tokyo is still at the top of the list for everyday food items.

Inexpensive India

However, not all Asian cities are tough on the wallet.

India's major cities - including Mumbai and New Delhi - were found to be among the least expensive in the world.

Mumbai's prices are kept low by large income inequality.

The low wages of many of the city's workers keep spending low, and government subsidies have helped them stay that way.

Outside of the subcontinent, Damascus in Syria saw the largest drop, becoming the fourth cheapest city in the world as the country's ongoing conflict has led to plummeting prices.

This is more than what the department attached in the decade from 2005.In a written reply to an unstarred question on Friday, minister of state for finance Santosh Kumar Gangwar said that in the last one year, properties worth Rs 11,032.27 crore were attached by the ED after issuing 175 Provisional Attachment Orders (PAO). In comparison, the total value of assets attached from 2005-2015 was Rs 9003.26 crore, statistics on ED website show. In the first three months of the current financial year, Rs 965.84 crore has been attached. The total cumulative attachments would be around Rs 22,000 crore as of June 30 this year, said sources in the department. The figures of properties attached in 2016-17 zoomed due to the Vijay Mallya case, in which properties worth close to Rs 10,000 crore were attached, sources said.More than half of the total searches and a third of the total arrests by the department across the country were effected in the last 15 months, statistics show. Some of these highprofile cases and searches were in Tamil Nadu; for instance the Sekhar Reddy case and Madurai granite mining. The ED is an organisation which goes after big names accused of corruption. The PMLA is a stringent law, where the onus is on the accused to prove that the attached properties are bought from known sources of income, say sources. The ED has been given a free hand to dig up dirty money, said sources. This, they added, reflected in the figures.Sources in the department said that these measures were taken in coordination with other investigative agencies like Income Tax Investigation Wing and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). A task force on shell companies had been created by the ministry of corporate affairs which involves all these departments. The ED is tracking shell companies through which crores of rupees are transferred out of the country. In April, ED sleuths arrested in Chennai a 36-year-old man who had allegedly routed Rs 78 crore through six shell companies.As of July 12, 1.62 lakh shell companies had been struck off the Registrar of Companies (RoC).

<|begin_of_text|>The gustatory system creates the human sense of taste, allowing us to perceive different flavors from substances that we consume as food and drink. Gustation, along with olfaction (the sense of smell), is classified as chemoreception. Because it functions by reacting with molecular chemical compounds in a given substance. Specialized cells in the gustatory system that are located on the tongue are called taste buds, and they sense tastants (taste molecules). The taste buds send the information after coming in contact with food from the tastants to the brain, where a molecule is processed as a certain taste. There are five main tastes: bitter, salty, sweet, sour, and umami (savory). All the varieties of flavor we experience are a combination of some or all of these tastes.

The sense of taste is transduced by taste buds. Which are clusters of 50-100 taste receptor cells located in the tongue, soft palate, epiglottis, pharynx, and esophagus. The tongue is the main sensory organ of the gustatory system. The tongue contains papillae, or specialized epithelial cells, which have taste buds on their surface. There are three types of papillae with taste buds in the human gustatory system:

Loading...

fungiform papillae, which are mushroom-shaped and located at the tip of the tongue;

foliate papillae, which are ridges and grooves toward the back of the tongue;

circumvallate papillae, which are circular-shaped and located in a row just in front of the end of the tongue.

You can’t taste food unless it’s mixed with your saliva

Each taste bud is flask-like in shape and formed by two types of cells: supporting cells and gustatory cells. Gustatory cells are short-lived and are continuously regenerating. They each contain a taste pore at the surface of the tongue which is the site of sensory transduction. Though there are small differences in sensation, all taste buds, no matter their location, can respond to all types of taste.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>To see how it works, consider a topic I know well: the recent history of inflation scares.

More than five years have passed since many conservatives started warning that the Federal Reserve, by taking action to contain the financial crisis and boost the economy, was setting the stage for runaway inflation. And, to be fair, that wasn’t a crazy position to take in 2009; I could have told you it was wrong (and, in fact, I did), but you could see where it was coming from.

Over time, however, as the promised inflation kept failing to arrive, there should have come a point when the inflationistas conceded their error and moved on.

In fact, however, few did. Instead, they mostly doubled down on their predictions of doom, and some moved on to conspiracy theorizing, claiming that high inflation was already happening, but was being concealed by government officials.

Why the bad behavior? Nobody likes admitting to mistakes, and all of us — even those of us who try not to — sometimes engage in motivated reasoning, selectively citing facts to support our preconceptions.

But hard as it is to admit one’s own errors, it’s much harder to admit that your entire political movement got it badly wrong. Inflation phobia has always been closely bound up with right-wing politics; to admit that this phobia was misguided would have meant conceding that one whole side of the political divide was fundamentally off base about how the economy works. So most of the inflationistas have responded to the failure of their prediction by becoming more, not less, extreme in their dogma, which will make it even harder for them ever to admit that they, and the political movement they serve, have been wrong all along.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>The platinum coin died yesterday, the casualty of a Treasury Department statement that says that—among other things—the Federal Reserve views the platinum tactic as illegitimate.

In operational terms, that’s the ballgame. If the Fed won’t play ball then it doesn’t really work. An administration determined to finance the government via platinum coin seigniorage over the objections of the Federal Reserve Board could probably find a way to do it, but a high-profile fight with the Fed would drastically undermine any market reassuring properties of this means of avoiding default.

A lot of the ensuing discussion has focused on political tactics. Some feel that by ruling out the coin, the administration has weakened its bargaining position. Administration officials argue, persuasively, that this is backwards. Platinum would have given an out to Republicans. Obama had two choices, one was to cut spending and the other was to resort to this goofy seeming gimmick. He went for gimmickry because that’s how determined he is to spend spend spend. With no alternatives on the table, Obama has the upper-hand in a high-stakes game of chicken. That said, the platinum coin was never about giving Obama a stronger tactical political position. Even if platinum worked extremely well, there would just be a March fight with congressional Republicans over the appropriations bills. The idea of the platinum coin was to avoid a high-stakes game of chicken whose mere existence is bad for America and the world.

That’s now not going to happen.

All that said, I’m glad we had this conversation. Direct discussion of the platinum coin was a good reminder that many people, including influential media figures, appear to have no idea what money is or how the monetary system works. Apart from the shockingly widespread view that the value of coins is determined by their metallic content, there was a lot of insistence that creating money was somehow an act of “magic.” In fact, the way all legal currency is created is that a government agency creates the money. Typically that’s the Federal Reserve accommodating bank demand for base money. But all kinds of things can happen. Forget “Quantitative Easing.” When the Fed does the thing that reporters call “raising interest rates” it doesn’t pull an interest rate lever. It sells bonds on the open market in exchange for money. And when that money enters the Fed, it vanishes. When they “lower interest rates” they buy bonds on the open market in exchange for money. Where do they get the money? From nowhere. They just make it. That’s money. Whether the

Consumer Reports Auto Reliability Survey: Ford Continues Fall While Seven Japanese Brands Top List

Audi and Cadillac make major jumps in rankings

December 2012 CoverYONKERS, NY-A perfect storm of reliability problems has dropped Ford to next to last among the 28 car brands ranked in Consumer Reports 2012 Annual Auto Reliability Survey, while its luxury brand, Lincoln, placed just a notch higher. The findings were released today before the Automotive Press Association in Detroit.

Only two years ago, Ford was Detroit's poster child for reliability. It cracked the top 10 among brands in Consumer Reports predicted-reliability scores, with more than 90 percent of its models being average or better. This year the top seven spots are all held by Japanese brands.

"Ford's bumpy road can be seen in the numbers. Sixty percent of Ford-branded models and half of Lincolns were below average in predicted reliability, and none placed above average," said Jake Fisher, director of automotive testing for Consumer Reports.

Several factors contributed to Ford's decline in Consumer Reports' reliability rankings. A few new or redesigned models, including the Explorer, Fiesta, and Focus, came out of the gate with more problems than normal. Ford has also added the MyFord/MyLincoln Touch electronic infotainment system, which has been problematic so far, to many vehicles. In addition, three historically reliable models-the Ford Escape, Fusion and the Lincoln MKZ-are not included in the analysis; the three were redesigned for 2013 and CR doesn't yet have reliability data on them.

Toyota, on the other hand, has excelled in Consumer Reports' latest ratings. Its three brands-Scion, Toyota, and Lexus-swept the top spots. Toyota is clearly setting the pace in reliability. Of the 27 models in the brand's lineup, 16 earned the highest rating. The subcompact Toyota Prius C earned Consumer Reports' top score overall. The hatchback Prius, the larger Prius V, and the new Prius plug-in were also above average.

The Toyota trio was followed by four other Japanese makes: Mazda, Subaru, Honda, and Acura, in that order. All of the models produced by the top seven brands had average or better reliability. And of the 90 Japanese models reflected in Consumer Reports' brand comparison, 86 were average or better, with 35 earning the highest rating.

<|begin_of_text|>The male is often troubled by concerns that his penis is not large enough to satisfy his partner or himself. He is ashamed to have others view his penis, especially in the flaccid state. Such concerns might be unfounded in reality and might be a presentation of social anxiety or some other clinical problem, such as erectile dysfunction. Concern over the size of the penis, when such concern becomes excessive, might present as the ‘small penis syndrome’, an obsessive rumination with compulsive checking rituals, body dysmorphic disorder, or as part of a psychosis. However, it is often a worry that can be described as within the normal experience of many men. Various potential causal factors are considered. A thorough assessment, normalizing the worry and then exploring the treatment options in detail with the man, is essential to allow the matter to be consolidated satisfactorily within the male ego.

Abbreviations SPS small penis syndrome BDD body dysmorphic disorder (dysmorphophobia) ED erectile dysfunction CBT cognitive behavioural therapy SSRI selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.

INTRODUCTION The penis, particularly in its erect state, is a symbol of masculinity. In many cultures it has come to symbolise attributes such as ‘largeness, strength, endurance, ability, courage, intelligence, knowledge, dominance over men, possession of women; a symbol of loving and being loved’. A review [1] is recommended which describes Indian Sadhus using weights, Dayak men in Borneo piercing the glans and then inserting items in the resultant holes to stimulate the partner, and the Topinama of Brazil, who encourage poisonous snakes to bite their penis to make it enlarge (for 6 months!). Some of these concepts date back over many thousands of years, and there is evidence that prehistoric cave dwellers attributed the symbolic values of strength and power to penile size, as well as those of virility and fertility, a process also recommended in the Kama Sutra [2]. Given the historical context it is perhaps no surprise that even today many men place great importance on the size of their penis. Hegemonic masculinity is defined by attributes such as physical strength, heterosexuality with authority over women and other men, showing no emotions (such as remorse and uncertainty, which might suggest vulnerability), economic independence, and an ability to demonstrate sexual ‘conquest’. While most men do not embody all of these qualities, society supports hegemonic masculinity within most of its institutions [3]. Given this historical and cultural background, it is perhaps unsurprising that for

The first film ever made in Hollywood was D.W. Griffith’s 1910 In Old California, a biograph melodrama about a Spanish maiden (Marion Leonard) who has an illegitimate son with a man who later becomes governor of California. It was shot in two days. [6]

When Horace and Daeida Wilcox founded Hollywood in 1887, they hoped it would become a religious community. Prohibitionists, they banned liquor from the town and offered free land to anyone willing to build a church. [25]

The most filmed author is William Shakespeare, including straight film versions, modern adaptations, ( West Side Story [1961], The Lion King [1994], etc.) and Shakespeare parodies. [1]

The shortest dialogue script since the introduction of talkies was written for Mel Brook’s Silent Movie (1976), which has only one spoken word throughout: “Non.” [1]

The first motion picture to depict a non-pornographic sex act was Extase (1933) starring Hedwig Kiesler, known later as Hedy Lamarr (1913-2000). Her character flees from an impotent husband, runs naked through the woods, bathes, and then has sex with a young engineer in a hut.l [17]

Though photos have survived, the movie A Daughter of the Gods is now considered lost

The first nude scene in a major motion picture was of swimmer and actress Annette Kellerman (1887-1975) in A Daughter of the Gods (1916). [17]

The earliest known American pornographic film is the 1915 A Free Ride, a.k.a. A Grass Sandwich. The film was directed by “A. Wise Guy” and was written by “Will She.” [17]

The Western Hero most portrayed on screen has been William Frederick Cody, a.k.a. Buffalo Bill, followed by William Bonny, a.k.a. Billy the Kid. [17]

The first African-American to play a leading role in a feature film was Sam Lucas (1850-1916) who was cast in the title role of Uncle Tom’s Cabin (1914). The first African-American actor to make a career in films was Noble Johnson (1881-1978). [17]

<|begin_of_text|>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Texan Sam Lovett had no health insurance in August 2010 when an emergency hospital stay brought the news from his doctors that his liver was failing and he could die within less than a year without a transplant.

The small distribution center where he worked did not provide health insurance. Lovett, 43, who lives near Comfort, Texas, was not able to buy private coverage on his own because of his already bad health. Though he had the resources to cover routine medical bills, he now needed a $400,000 organ transplant and no doctor or clinic would take him without insurance.

“They were making arrangements to send me to a hospice. One doctor flatly told me that I had a better chance of leaving the hospital dead than alive,” said Lovett, who had a history of alcoholism and obesity.

But in the months that followed, Lovett was able to enroll in the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP). The program was created by the healthcare law that President Barack Obama, a Democrat, signed in March 2010 despite the united opposition of Republicans in Congress. The program paid for Lovett’s transplant surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix last December.

PCIP is a temporary government program set up to run until 2014, when the Obama healthcare law is due to take full effect and prevent insurance companies from the common practice of denying people coverage due to pre-existing medical conditions. About 60,000 Americans already are receiving medical coverage through the program, according to the Obama administration.

As the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to rule in the next few weeks on whether to overturn the law considered to be Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement, Lovett said the choice is very clear for him and others unable to get insurance without the statute’s provisions.

“Without this, you’re going to die,” Lovett said in an interview arranged by the Consumers Union organization, which supports the law. “From my perspective, that’s what the Supreme Court will sanction, or not - whether people will be allowed to die because they can’t get insurance.”

Unlike people in many other rich nations where health insurance is near universal, many Americans struggle without medical coverage even as the country pays more for healthcare than anywhere else in the world. The U.S. healthcare system is a patchwork of private insurance and restrictive government programs that has left tens of millions uninsured.

Many Americans receive health insurance only because their employers provide it as a job benefit. But some companies, particularly smaller employers, do not offer it.

Annual house price inflation hit 10.5% in May, the highest rate for four years, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

That is up from 9.9% in the previous month.

Once again, the market was in large part driven by London, where house prices rose by a record 20.1% over the year.

But excluding London and the South East, prices rose by a much more modest 6.4% across the UK.

Prices were up in every region, except for Northern Ireland, where they fell by 0.7%.

In England, prices rose by 11%, in Wales prices were up by 6.5%, and in Scotland they rose by 3.6%.

According to the ONS index, the average price of a house across the UK is now £262,000.

"Annual house price growth of 20.1% is borderline insane, but there are signs that the capital started to cool slightly in June and July," said Jonathan Samuels, the chief executive of Dragonfly Property Finance.

The housing charity Shelter said the only answer was more house-building.

"Once again these figures show that house prices are spinning out of control, putting a stable home even further out of reach for ordinary families," said Campbell Robb, Shelter's chief executive.

Politicians who rest their demands for more redistribution on studies of income inequality but leave out the existing safety net are putting their thumb on the scale.

Second and more important, it is well known that people's earnings in general rise over their working lifetime. And so, for example, a person who decides to invest more in education may experience a lengthy period of low income while studying, followed by significantly higher income later on. Snapshot measures of income inequality can be misleading.

According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Expenditure Survey, if you sort households according to their pretax income, in 2010 the bottom fifth accounted for 8.7% of overall consumption, the middle fifth for 17.1%, and the top fifth for about 38.6%. Go back 10 years to 2000—before two recessions, the Bush tax cuts, and continuing expansions of globalization and computerization—and the numbers are similar. The bottom fifth accounted for 8.9% of consumption, the middle fifth for 17.3%, and the top fifth for 37.3%.

While this stability is something to applaud, surely more important are the real gains in consumption by income groups over the past decade. From 2000 to 2010, consumption has climbed 14% for individuals in the bottom fifth of households, 6% for individuals in the middle fifth, and 14.3% for individuals in the top fifth when we account for changes in U.S. population and the size of households. This despite the dire economy at the end of the decade.

The percentage of low-income households with microwave ovens grew to 92.4% from 74.9% between 2001 and 2009. Fully 75.5% of low-income Americans now have a cell phone, and over a quarter of those have access to the Internet through their phones.

We would hazard a guess that if you were to ask a typical low-income American in 2009 if he would like to trade his house for its 2001 version, he would tell you to take a hike. How then is he worse off in 2009?

So poor people are not in fact getting worse off because when they get worse off, we give them food stamps. That's exactly the sort of deep thinking I would

Kohr was one of Schumaker’s instructors, and the two remained lifelong associates and friends.

Roughly three years after the Meltdown of 2008 I encountered an article online with the curious title, “This Economic Crisis is a “Crisis of Bigness.” It attracted my attention, because like many other observers I’d become convinced long before that both government and corporations had grown too large to accomplish even well-intentioned goals. The impulses for a more centralized society and a more economically integrated world — the impulses, that is, that bring about “bigness” — were mistakes from the get-go. Globalization promised universal prosperity, but instead has made the rich richer, slowly and painfully begun wiping out the American middle class, and created legions of unemployed or underemployed poor people — precariat is the term some writers are now using for this new class. The precariat consists of the army of adjunct faculty, temps, short-term contract workers, etc., most doing what they are doing because it is the only work they can find in the globalized “new economy.” The underemployment crisis heralds eventual civil unrest, especially with the Bureau of Labor Statistics insisting, against all experience, that the unemployment rate is just 5.5% (the U-3 figure as of this writing). Does anyone really think this is good, whether for workers or the economy at large?

The above article cited Leopold Kohr, on the grounds that he had predicted central aspects of the present situation over half a century ago in his magnum opus The Breakdown of Nations (1957). I immediately ordered Kohr’s book, and when it came, I put every spare minute into reading it straight through. It is not light reading. Works that raise fundamental issues in political philosophy as well as economics never are. I wondered why I’d never heard of Kohr or Breakdown before. Then I realized: unlike someone such as Joseph Schumpeter, whose analysis of the long-term fate of capitalism as an industrial system in Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy (1947) was the most interesting I’d

Only thirty-six percent defend the status quo. What's more, the trend has been moving towards the pro-legalization position, and continues to do so.

It is about time. The entire drug war is a monstrosity, a crime against the Bill of Rights, the greatest contributor to gang violence, a wholesale attack on our civil liberties and the right of individuals to control their own bodies. Characterizing drug problems as a criminal justice issue has been an unmitigated failure, except for serving law-enforcement special interests, growing the bureaucracy, and deepening the pockets of drug kingpins who profit off this madness.

Marijuana criminalization always rested on the flimsiest of grounds. Fear of blacks and Hispanics fueled the hysteria. So did conflicting propaganda about how marijuana would make American youth violent, yet also make them docile and unable to serve in the Armed Forces.

If marijuana is not the most benign recreational drug known to humanity, it is near the top. Alcohol kills tens of thousands of Americans a year. Tobacco kills hundreds of thousands. Pot directly kills zero.

Scientists measure the lethality of a drug by its therapeutic index. The TI gauges how many effective doses of a drug it takes to kill the median user. Alcohol's TI is somewhere around ten. Caffeine's is approximately one hundred. Marijuana's is a matter of conjecture, since it's been extrapolated from studies with lab rats and other such methods. But scientists estimate its TI somewhere between 1,000 and 40,000. In other words, marijuana is somewhere between a hundred and four thousand times less lethal than alcohol.

This is not to say that smoking pot has no negative side-effects. Long-term users can easily fritter their time away, satisfied to bask in the high rather than doing something productive. This is a danger with other drugs too, including alcohol, as well as with many other activities like watching sports or playing video games. But the answer is not jail time or a federal program aimed at reforming individuals from these poor habits. A free society does not use police power to deal with frivolousness of youth.

The responsible way a civil society can handle drugs, regardless of how dangerous they are, is through community institutions. Many Americans want nothing to do with drugs. Private organizations can discourage use. Property owners can exclude behavior they dislike from their premises. Meanwhile, those seeking help can get

"The tightening policy is creating a lot of difficulties for local governments trying to repay debt, and is causing defaults," he told a meeting at the World Economic Forum in Dalian. "Our version of subprime in the US is lending to local authorities and the government is taking this very seriously."

"Everybody assumes that they will be bailed out by the central government if they default, but I disagree with this. It means that the people will ultimately pay the bill for it all, at a cost to the broader welfare."

"Those who are not highly indebted are forced to help those who are," he said, echoing the debate over moral hazard that has divided opinion in the West since the banking rescues.

Local governments have created more than 6,000 arms-length companies to circumvent restrictions on bond issuance, creating a huge patronage machine for party bosses that has largely escaped central control.

The audit office said the loans have reached $1.7 trillion (£1 trillion). While some of the money has been used to finance much-needed investments in water systems and roads, a large part has fuelled unbridled construction with a dubious rate of return.

The local governments depend on land sales for 40pc of their revenue so the process has become incestuous and self-feeding. Such reliance on property sales revenues has greatly aggravated the post-bubble crisis in Ireland.

Mr Cheng said China is entering a "very tough period" as growth runs into the inflation buffers, threatening the sort of incipient stagflation seen in the West in the 1970s and leaving the central bank with an unpleasant choice. "The inflation rate and the growth rate are conflicting with each other: it is very troubling," he said, describing what is known to economists as the Phillips Curve dilemma.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

According to Oxford Dictionary the term Slave is defined as “a person who is the legal property of another and is forced to obey them” as in the case of the United States during the 18th and 19th centuries where slavery was a legalized institution. Oxford dictionary also defines slavery as “a person who works very hard without proper remuneration or appreciation” as in today’s world of a person working for a company or corporation where their efforts are usually under appreciated. It also describes a slave as “a person who is excessively dependent upon or controlled by something” or “a device, or part of one, directly controlled by another”. Debt can be an instrument used to control an individual or a nation for that matter. In this case, an individual is dependent upon “Credit” to buy products.

Then the credit becomes a debt that has to be repaid. It becomes a “control mechanism” as the creditor becomes the “Slave Owner” and the debtor becomes the “Slave”. What is the point? In today’s world of unlimited credit, consumers become modern-day slaves to their creditors. What is the difference between slavery in 18th century America with imported African slaves and the America of 2013? There is no difference besides the physical abuse of the African slaves by their owners. In America, consumers suffer psychological abuse by its creditors. As long as an individual remains in debt bondage, that person will have to repay that debt until the day that person literally dies in most cases.

The Commission recommends that Congress consider enacting legislation to make data broker practices more visible to consumers and to give consumers greater control over the immense amounts of personal information about them collected and shared by data brokers.

The report, “Data Brokers: A Call for Transparency and Accountability” is the result of a study of nine data brokers, representing a cross-section of the industry, undertaken by the FTC to shed light on the data broker industry. Data brokers obtain and share vast amounts of consumer information, typically behind the scenes, without consumer knowledge. Data brokers sell this information for marketing campaigns and fraud prevention, among other purposes. Although consumers benefit from data broker practices which, for example, help enable consumers to find and enjoy the products and services they prefer, data broker practices also raise privacy concerns.

“The extent of consumer profiling today means that data brokers often know as much – or even more – about us than our family and friends, including our online and in-store purchases, our political and religious affiliations, our income and socioeconomic status, and more,” said FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez. “It’s time to bring transparency and accountability to bear on this industry on behalf of consumers, many of whom are unaware that data brokers even exist.”

The report finds that data brokers collect and store billions of data elements covering nearly every U.S. consumer. Just one of the data brokers studied holds information on more than 1.4 billion consumer transactions and 700 billion data elements and another adds more than 3 billion new data points to its database each month.

Among the report’s findings:

Data brokers collect consumer data from extensive online and offline sources, largely without consumers’ knowledge, ranging from consumer purchase data, social media activity, warranty registrations, magazine subscriptions, religious and political affiliations, and other details of consumers’ everyday lives.

Consumer data often passes through multiple layers of data brokers sharing data with each other. In fact, seven of the nine data brokers in the Commission study had shared information with another data broker in the study.

Data brokers combine online and offline data to market to consumers online.

Data brokers combine and analyze data about consumers to make inferences about them, including potentially sensitive inferences such as those related to ethnicity, income, religion, political leanings, age, and health conditions.

L'Europa cresce ininterrottamente da 15 mesi, l'inflazione sale e il tasso di disoccupazione è tornato a una sola cifra. Tutte ottime notizie per l'Eurozona ma che inevitabilmente si vanno a intrecciare con le politiche della Bce che, secondo quanto riporta il Foglio, potrebbe decidere l'interruzione totale del quantitative easing a partire dal 2018. Si aprirebbe così una nuova fase di incertezza e per la politica italiana sarebbe consigliabile arrivare alla fine del Qe con un governo stabile che si giochi la partita della flessibilità con l'Europa con più forza rispetto a oggi.

Cos'è il 'bazooka' Qe?

Il quantitative easing è uno strumento non convenzionale di politica monetaria, in grado di assicurare la permanenza dell'inflazione al di sopra di una certo valore-obiettivo, fissato dalla Bce "sotto, ma vicino" al 2%. In pratica, la Banca Centrale aumenta la base monetaria - banconote più depositi alla banca centrale - con operazioni di mercato aperto, e la inietta nel sistema finanziario ed economico attraverso l'acquisto di prodotti finanziari, come i titoli di Stato. Più si stampa moneta, più la valuta si deprezza e a guadagnarci è l'export Ue. Altro vantaggio è l'abbassamento dei tassi di interesse.

In fact, the brain is enveloped in countless overlapping electric fields, generated by the neural circuits of scores of communicating neurons. The fields were once thought to be an "epiphenomenon, a 'bug' of sorts, occurring during neural communication," says neuroscientist Costas Anastassiou, a postdoctoral scholar in biology at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).

New work by Anastassiou and his colleagues, however, suggests that the fields do much more - and that they may, in fact, represent an additional form of neural communication.

"In other words," says Anastassiou, the lead author of a paper about the work appearing in the journal Nature Neuroscience, "while active neurons give rise to extracellular fields, the same fields feed back to the neurons and alter their behavior," even though the neurons are not physically connected - a phenomenon known as ephaptic coupling. "So far, neural communication has been thought to occur at localized machines, termed synapses. Our work suggests an additional means of neural communication through the extracellular space independent of synapses."

Extracellular electric fields exist throughout the living brain, though they are particularly strong and robustly repetitive in specific brain regions such as the hippocampus, which is involved in memory formation, and the neocortex, the area where long-term memories are held. "The perpetual fluctuations of these extracellular fields are the hallmark of the living and behaving brain in all organisms, and their absence is a strong indicator of a deeply comatose, or even dead, brain," Anastassiou explains.

Previously, neurobiologists assumed that the fields were capable of affecting - and even controlling - neural activity only during severe pathological conditions such as epileptic seizures, which induce very strong fields. Few studies, however, had actually assessed the impact of far weaker - but very common - non-epileptic fields. "The reason is simple," Anastassiou says. "It is very hard to conduct an in vivo experiment in the absence of extracellular fields," to observe what changes when the fields are not around.

To tease out those effects, Anastassiou and his colleagues, including Caltech neuroscientist Christof Koch, the Lois and Victor Troendle Professor of Cognitive and Behavioral Biology and professor of computation and neural systems, focused on strong but slowly oscillating fields, called local field potentials (L

OTTAWA -- Fuelled by climbing prices for fresh fruits and vegetables, the pace of Canada's annual inflation rate accelerated last month to 1.6 per cent, Statistics Canada said Friday.

Inflation grew at its fastest pace in December since late 2014. Last month's number also followed a 1.4 per cent year-over-year increase in November, the agency's latest consumer price index found.

The figure came out as the economy deals with the effects of the steep slide in commodity and oil prices, which have also helped drag down Canada's exchange rate. The lower loonie is expected to drive up costs for imported goods.

The report said prices for fresh fruit increased 13.2 per cent last month compared to a year earlier, while fresh vegetables rose 13.3 per cent.

The price of lettuce surged 21.8 per cent.

Overall, consumers spent 3.7 per cent more on food last month than the previous year.

On top of higher produce prices, Canadians were also paying considerably more for home and mortgage insurance, automobiles and electricity compared to a year earlier, the report said.

The agency said lower prices for gasoline, natural gas and fuel oil applied downward pressure on inflation. Gasoline prices were down 4.8 per cent compared to December 2014, while natural gas decreased 12.9 per cent and fuel oil dropped by 16.8 per cent.

But the slipping price of energy slowed somewhat, which allowed overall inflation to creep up, said Dawn Desjardins, deputy chief economist for RBC.

"We all knew that there was going to be this huge weight on that headline rate because of the energy and now we're seeing some relief from that," Desjardins said.

"It's kind of following the script, if you will, of what forecasters were looking for."

To help explain the inflation-cooling effect, some analysts also pointed to the sharp monthly decline in the price of clothing and footwear, which fell 5.2 per cent from November to December.

But moving forward, National Bank senior economist Matthieu Arseneau predicts shoppers will continue to face higher prices for imported goods in many categories.

"Despite weak energy prices, we don't expect Canadian consumers to get some respite because the dive in the currency should be a significant offset," Arseneau wrote in a note to clients.

By region, Statistics Canada found that consumer prices increased in every province last month compared to the year before, with British

We can assure you that there are no coincidences on Wall Street. There is only rampant, rampaging insider trading and fiendish manipulation.

Any time they think they are in need of a good fleecing, all the poor sheople have to do is get back into the general stock markets where their Illuminist shearers will be more than happy to oblige them. We absolutely guarantee that the pink of your sheople skin will be showing as all your wool is shaved off right down to the hair follicles. You've probably heard about "pink flamingos." Well, now we are going to see a lot of pink sheople wandering around aimlessly, wondering where all their vaporized money went, as they are prepared for the big slaughter while the Big Sting Two goes into its next phase. You need to protect yourself with gold, silver and their now bargain-basement related shares, unless of course the color pink flatters you.

The Dow, powered by its PPT anti-gravity machine, and in the face of some of the worst economic news of all time, still somehow managed to tack on an unbelievable, mind-blowing and stupefying 889.35 points as the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index dropped off a cliff from September's 61.4 to October's 38, an all-time low (the "experts" expected 52), as the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller 20-city housing index dropped 16.6 percent in August from a year ago, the largest decline on record going back to 2000, and as the smaller, 10-city index, fell 17.7 percent, the biggest decline in its 21

Google currently dominates search in most markets The world of search could be facing its biggest shake-up since the arrival of Google. Last week Microsoft launched a bid to take over Yahoo. The software firm offered $44.6bn (£22.3m) for Yahoo, one of the stalwarts of the commercial web since its inception. The two firms have many potential synergies in their services, such as their webmail offerings. But for many observers, a combination of the two companies search offerings could be the most interesting outcome. "The key measure of success in three years time is whether they will have made any progress in fending off - and catching up to - Google," wrote Charlene Li, principle analyst at Forrester Research. According to Nielsen online, Google has a 56% share of the search market in the US, compared to 18% for Yahoo and 14% for Microsoft's Live facility. So even a combined service would still only account for around half of all of the searches done of Google. "The reality is that no one's going to get near Google's search share over the next few years," wrote Nate Elliott, analyst at Jupiter Research. Ad-aware In Europe, the situation is even more acute. According to figures from research firm Comscore, Google has 80-90% of the search share in many European markets. If it goes ahead, the Microsoft and Yahoo merger would be one of the major events in the history of the internet

Alex Burmaster, Nielsen Online "Whether this deal happens or not, it'll be incredibly difficult for anyone to compete with Google for European search share," said Mr Elliott However, he says, a joint offering could compete in other ways. "A combination of MSN and Yahoo would definitely be better-positioned to compete with Google for paid search revenues than each company is now." Many European firms do not bother advertising with anyone but Google because other search engines do not have the reach, he wrote, but a combined offering could change that. "[Microsoft and Yahoo] would still have less than 10% search share in the big European markets...but it would at least give marketers a reason to run trials beyond Google," he wrote.
