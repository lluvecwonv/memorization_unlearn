As a first step toward a much grander Clojure project I needed a unification library to supplement a simple logic engine (the second step in the larger plan). There are a few options floating around, but nothing that was readily available nor complete. Therefore, I decided to package a simple unification library in hopes that others might find it useful and hopefully eliminate the need to search around fruitlessly like I did. A basic use case for Unifycle is as follows:

[sourcecode lang=”clojure” gist=”599021″](use ‘[me.fogus.unifycle :only [unifier]])

;; unify two expressions with an occurs check

(unifier ‘((?a *?x ** 2) + (?b *?x) +?c) ‘(?z + (4 * 5) + 3))

;=> ((?a * 5 ** 2) + (4 * 5) + 3)[/sourcecode]

Unifycle exposes a number of canned functions, starting with unifier, try-subst, and garner-unifiers. These functions use an occurs check internally, so use them with that fact in mind. I have also exposed versions of these functions without internal occurs check named unifier-, try-subst-, and garner-unifiers-. If you know what unification is then you know what an occurs check is — if not, then this whole post is probably moot.

I have also exposed factory functions named make-occurs-unify-fn, make-occurs-subst-fn, make-occurs-unifier-fn, make-unify-fn, make-subst-fn, and make-unifier-fn. The first three create versions using and occurs check and the last three create versions without. Each of these factory functions take a single predicate function that is used to determine if a symbol in a (potentially) unified expression refers to a variable. From the example above, you’ll notice that the default variable function is preceded with a question mark (e.g.?snigglet ).

I have created a documentation page for Unifycle that I plan to expand. Any and all help is appreciated.

In Matilda, the children’s fantasy movie directed by Danny DeVito and based on Roald Dahl’s book of the same name, the lead character, six-and-a-half year old Matilda, on her first day of school correctly calculates the result of 13 times 379 in her head – much to the amazement of her teacher and classmates. If such an event had taken place in our classrooms, we too would have been astounded and many, if not all, of us would have described young Matilda as being intelligent or even a genius. Yet if we told you that we have a machine that can solve the very same problem in less than a nanosecond, would any of you describe it as being intelligent?

What is 7 times 8? I have posted a math trick so you’ll never forget the answer. You can multiply any two numbers from 6 to 10 using your two hands!

Multiply Numbers Between 6 to 10 On Your Fingers

There is a mathematical reason why this method is sound.

Multiply Numbers Between 6 to 10 On Your Fingers – Why It Works

I recommend watching the videos as the examples illustrate the method very clearly.

I’ve written up a short summary after the jump.

Multiply On Your Hands

Imagine numbering your fingers from 6 to 10, going from your thumb to your pinky finger on each hand.

Line up your fingers for the two numbers you want to multiply. If you want to multiply 7 by 8, line up your left index finger with your right middle finger.

Count the two fingers that are touching and the fingers below them. This tells you the tens digit of your answer.

Then count the fingers above the touching fingers on each left and right hands. Multiply those two numbers. That becomes the units digit of the answer.

For 7 times 8, you will find 5 fingers are touching and below, and then there will be 3×2 = 6 as the units digit. This gives an answer of 56.

And this works for any two numbers between 6 and 10!

Occasionally you will have to carry-over. When you do 6×7, you will find there are 3 fingers touching or below (to make 30), then then you will find there are 4×3 = 12 units. So you need to add up 30 and 12 to get 42.

I hope you like this trick!

Sonos is wildly popular for a reason. We in the tech biz toss the term “wireless multiroom audio” around a lot, but what Sonos really does is put great-sounding music in every corner of your home or business — and they make it dead simple. We like to think of Sonos as the audio company Apple wishes it could be — one that gives you amazing sound that “just works.” So what could possibly raise our enthusiasm about the company and its wares? We have the answer for you here in our Sonos One review.

Sonos isn’t alone in this game any longer. Alexa came along and blew the home speaker floodgates wide open. With its open digital assistant platform, Amazon was able not only to popularize its own speaker products, but also to see to it that Alexa started popping up everywhere and controlling everything. Today, if your product doesn’t work with Alexa, it’s considered behind the times. What’s more, Google was prodded to get in on the action and is now pushing its own line of speakers.

Sonos had to pivot, and pivot it has. In October, Sonos announced the Sonos One, a reimagined version of its popular Play:1 speaker that’s built to be the smartest smart speaker on the market. Out of the box, the Sonos One supports Amazon’s Alexa, but the company promises Google Assistant will come to the One sometime in 2018. Follow below to find out if the company’s latest effort to even further simplify whole-home audio is as successful as it sounds.

Out of the box

Dan Baker/Digital Trends

Sonos long ago perfected its out-of-box experience, drawing inspiration from the folks at Apple and making it all its own. Inside the Sonos Play One box, you’ll find a simple setup card, information on downloading and setting up Amazon’s Alexa app, and a clever sort of “dial” meant to inform and inspire you to tell Alexa how to get music going in your home.

Setup

We’ve been praising Sonos for its foolproof setup process, and we’re going to go ahead and keep heaping on the kudos. Figuring out how to seamlessly integrate Amazon’s Alexa assistant and app into its ecosystem is something the company says it pored over for months — and it shows. The process is, like all things Sonos, dead simple.

Look at Ms. going full SWERF on us. The hell is this? https://t.co/P7J9NByhI6 — Amadi (@amaditalks) November 4, 2015

Like many feminists, my interest in women’s rights began when I started noticing I was treated like I was less than the men around me. I didn’t analyze much deeper than that — I just needed confirmation that something wasn’t right, I wasn’t imagining it, and it wasn’t my fault. Now that my analysis has gone deeper, and is rooted firmly in an anti-oppression framework, it’s clear to me that when I first started learning and believing in feminism I was, in fact, a liberal feminist.

Liberal feminism provides an individualistic view of women’s rights that holds equality with men as its end goal. Liberal feminism focuses on advancing women’s positions in existing institutions and believes that what women want out of life is what men want and have already secured for themselves.

Way back then, I understood feminism in relation to my life, my experiences, and my choices. I didn’t spend much time considering how my internalized misogyny shaped those choices — even the choices I now see were problematic because they reinforced mechanisms of women’s oppression.

For me, then, and for liberal feminists today, the individual is queen. Any choice a woman makes is, by definition, a feminist choice because choosing is a feminist act. Even choices like pandering to the male gaze or self-objectifying must be applauded. As a result, I often engaged in decidedly unfeminist behaviour while uncritically wrapping myself in a comfortingly progressive label.

Once I began critically examining my beliefs and learning more about the history of feminism, I realized the many ways in which so-called liberal feminism falls short. What soon became clear was that liberal feminism isn’t feminism at all. Uncritically worshipping individual choices ignores the structures and institutions that support patriarchy. Focusing narrowly on advancing in the public sphere ignores the oppression women face in our homes. More worryingly, refusing to examine the context and impacts of our choices allows men and women to continue reinforcing misogyny and male supremacy while patting themselves on the back and failing to work towards liberation for all women in any meaningful way.

Supporting misogynist ideas, behaviours, and structures while declaring yourself a feminist requires a stunning lack of self-awareness and critical thinking, and an intricate set of unquestioned beliefs whose main purpose is

The Helix Bridge provides a pedestrian connection across the head of the Singapore River between the city’s existing CBD and its new Bayfront district. Its commission was the result of a selected 36-entry international design competition held in 2006.

The plan concept was to curve the bridge in an arc so that it arrives fluidly into foreshore promenades on each side. It also enabled the bridge to connect in its centre to an adjacent vehicular bridge’s footpath while shifting away from it beyond this point of junction.

Seeking a delicate, lightweight contrast to the vehicular bridge, the concept evolved of a double helix structure. This form enabled the canopy, required by the brief, to be integrated as segmented panels of glass and perforated steel, unlike other bridge structures. The structural typology also proved highly effective in working to a curvilinear plan, and in generating an intriguing sense of movement flow along the journey.

The Helix Bridge is illuminated at night by ribbons of LED lighting accentuating the interplay of the two helix tubes and their intervening, connecting ties. Four ovular-shaped ‘pods’ cantilever out from the structure enabling people to gain wider appreciation of the bridge form and providing gathering space for viewing bay events. Conceptual Framework The design of The Helix Bridge responds to the brief of an international architectural competition calling for a unique structural form that could be symbolic of Singapore’s goal of promoting the identity of Asia’s ‘connected city’. The plan concept was to curve the bridge away from an adjoining linear vehicular bridge, such that it touched at a point for pedestrian interconnection, yet descended in each direction to fluidly continue along existing prom

When learning A-level maths, much time is devoted to learning how to differentiate and integrate. For this week’s blog post, I have collected some puzzles based on these skills. They should be fun to solve, present a few surprises and maybe even provide a teacher or two with an extra challenge for capable students.

The answers to these puzzles will appear here from Sunday at 8am.

Let’s start with an integral:

An Integral Source: mscroggs.co.uk

What is

$$\int_0^{\frac\pi2}\frac1{1+\tan^ax}\,dx?$$

This might look difficult to you. You might first start by substituting in some specific values for $a$, and this would be a good way to start, but solving the integral in general is difficult. However, considering the second integral $$\int_0^{\frac\pi2}\frac1{1+\cot^ax}\,dx$$ along with the integral in the question should help.

Before I say too much, I’m going to stop and leave any further discussion of this puzzle for the answers [available from Sunday 8am].

Next, let’s have a go at a few derivatives:

Six years ago, an absolutely devastating tsunami caused a triple meltdown at Japan’s Fukushima nuclear power facility. It was the worst environmental disaster in all of human history, and even though six years have passed since that time, nobody knows where the three melted cores are. Just recently, authorities believe that they spotted some melted fuel underneath reactor 2, but even from a distance the level of nuclear radiation that was detected was being described as “unimaginable”. Essentially what we are talking about are three enormous “dirty bombs” that are continuously emitting tremendous amounts of nuclear radiation into the air, water and soil. Some of the radioactive elements that are being released have half-lives that are measured in tens of thousands of years, and so the poisonous effect of these “dirty bombs” could potentially be with us for generation after generation.

Personally, I don’t know why the big mainstream news outlets in the U.S. are almost entirely ignoring Fukushima these days. Fox News did a story on the “unimaginable” radiation at Fukushima just a few days ago, but that was about it.

To me, it is certainly newsworthy that nuclear radiation inside reactor 2 at Fukushima is at the highest level ever recorded…

Radiation levels inside a damaged reactor at Japan’s Fukushima nuclear plant have hit a record high, and are the worst since the plant suffered a triple meltdown nearly six years ago. The latest readings now pose a serious challenge as officials prepare to dismantle the stricken facility. Radiation levels inside the containment vessel of reactor No. 2 at Fukushima has reached 530 sieverts per hour—a figure described by experts as “unimaginable.”

Previously, the highest level of radiation measured at Fukushima was 73 sieverts per hour, and just a small fraction of that amount would be fatal to most humans…

Needless to say, this plant is not fit for human life. Just one dose of a single sievert is enough to cause radiation sickness and nausea. Exposure to four to five sieverts would kill about half of those exposed to it within a month, while a single dose of 10 sieverts is enough to kill a person within weeks.

At 530 sieverts per hour, the radiation is so intense that even robots can only last for a couple of hours in that environment. The Japanese hope to eventually remove the melted fuel from these reactors someday, but first they have to figure out if it is even possible.

And the truth is that the level of radiation in reactor 2 may actually be far higher

A lot greater. To have just a break-even chance of meeting that 1.5 degree goal we solemnly set in Paris, we’ll need to close all of the coal mines and some of the oil and gas fields we’re currently operating long before they’re exhausted.

“Absent some incredible breakthrough in mythical carbon-sucking unicorns, the numbers say we’re done with the expansion of the fossil fuel industry,” says Kretzmann. “Living up to the Paris Agreement means we must start a managed decline in the fossil fuel industry immediately—and manage that decline as quickly as possible.”

“Managed decline” means we don’t have to grind everything to a halt tomorrow; we can keep extracting fuel from existing oil wells and gas fields and coal mines. But we can’t go explore for new ones. We can’t even develop the ones we already know about, the ones right next to our current projects.

In the United States alone, the existing mines and oil wells and gas fields contain 86 billion tons of carbon emissions—enough to take us 25 percent of the way to a 1.5 degree rise in global temperature. But if the U.S. energy industry gets its way and develops all the oil wells and fracking sites that are currently planned, that would add another 51 billion tons in carbon emissions. And if we let that happen, America would single-handedly blow almost 40 percent of the world’s carbon budget.

This new math is bad news for lots of powerful players. The fossil fuel industry has based its entire business model on the idea that it can endlessly “replenish” the oil and gas it pumps each year; its teams of geologists are constantly searching for new fields to drill. In September, Apache Corporation announced that it has identified fields in West Texas that hold three billion barrels of oil. Leaving that oil underground—which the new math shows we must do if we want to meet the climate targets set in Paris—would cost the industry tens of billions of dollars.

For understandable reasons, the unions whose workers build pipelines and drill wells also resist attempts to change. Consider the current drama over the Dakota Access oil pipeline. In September, even after pipeline security guards armed with pepper spray and guard dogs attacked Native Americans who were nonviolently defending grave sites from bulldozers, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka called on the Obama administration to allow construction to proceed. “Pipeline construction and maintenance,” Trumka said, “provides quality jobs to tens of thousands of skilled workers

There was a time when manual transmissions were synonymous with performance cars, but that time is past.

Ferrari is the latest automaker to retire the clutch pedal, a move that will probably seem like a gut punch to fans of stick shifts, but isn’t too surprising given the low sales of manuals in Ferraris and other high-end performance cars over the past few years. And that’s not even the primary reason why Ferrari is ditching manuals.

“Ferrari is design, performance, and state-of-the-art technologies. There’s no manual transmission that can beat this performance and therefore we have decided to stay on the double-clutch gearbox,” Michael Hugo Leiters, the automaker’s chief technology officer, said in an interview with Motor Authority at the recent 2016 Paris Motor Show. Even a well-shifted manual can’t match the speed of modern dual-clutch transmissions, after all.

For decades, manual transmissions had a performance advantage over those without clutch pedals, but today’s dual-clutch transmissions have erased that advantage. They shift faster, and they help carmakers snag customers that might have been discouraged by having to master a manual.

Ferrari isn’t alone in leaving the manual transmission behind. Lamborghini and McLaren don’t have a single manual between them, and Porsche has made the dual-clutch PDK transmission mandatory on the highest-performance versions of its 911. Porsche still offers manuals on lower-level models, though, and Aston Martin still offers them throughout its range.

Manuals are also much easier to find on less-expensive cars. Once you leave the six-figure realm, they start to become more common on performance cars. The manual transmission is definitely on the endangered species list, but it’s not extinct … yet.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Fish, reptiles, and even some invertebrates appear to play. But when is it play, and not something else? And why do animals do it?

During a visit to the National Zoo in Washington, DC, biopsychologist Gordon Burghardt decided to peek in on a Nile soft-shelled turtle its keepers affectionately called “Pigface.” Pigface had been a zoo resident for more than 50 years, and Burghardt had seen him before, but this time, he noticed something a bit curious—Pigface was playing basketball.

“It was by itself,” recalls Burghardt, currently at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, and “it had started to knock around” a basketball provided by its keepers. The year was 1994, and play had only rarely and anecdotally been reported in animals other than mammals, but he thought that might be what Pigface was doing. The 1-meter-long turtle exuberantly pushed the ball around its aquatic enclosure, swimming through the water with ease as it batted the ball in front of it with its nose. “If you saw a dog or an otter going around batting a ball, bouncing around and chasing it, and going back and forth and doing it over and over again, we’d have no problem calling it play,” he says. “And that’s what the turtle was doing.”

More recently, ethologist Jennifer Mather of the University of Lethbridge in Canada learned that two of her octopus research subjects had repeatedly blown jet streams of water at floating empty pill bottles, shooting them across the surface of their tanks at the Seattle Aquarium. “If you give an [octopus] something new, it will grab it in its arms and bring it up to its mouth, probably exploring it chemically,” she says. This would usually happen a couple of times, she adds, until it “knew what it was, and didn’t bother anymore. But these two, it’s like they suddenly thought, ‘Maybe I can do something with this.’ ”

For Burghardt and Mather and most researchers who have witnessed such bizarre activities in reptiles, fish, and even invertebrates, it is clear that these animals engage in some form of play. But not everyone is convinced. “I personally doubt it,” says behavioral physiologist Bernd Heinrich of the University of Vermont. “I personally have never seen anything I’d call ‘play’ in turtles and was

Remove the nozzle from the pump and insert it into the fuel filler opening. Pull the handle inside the nozzle upward to release the gas into your tank. The nozzle may have a trigger-lock feature that holds the handle in place while fueling to prevent having to stand and hold it. Once the tank is full, the gas pump will shut off with a click and gas will stop flowing. If you do not intend to completely fill your tank, you will have to watch the pump to see when you have reached the desired dollar amount of gasoline and then release the handle, or stop the automatic flow by pulling up on the handle to release it. Replace the nozzle back on the pump, reattach your fuel filler cap, shut the fuel filler door and you’re on the road again.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|

We know they resemble miniature shower heads, or perhaps a pair of rather fetching earrings; we know they incorporate dual optical sensors so they can automatically pause and play music; we know they come with dual microphones and a battery that should keep them powered for up to five hours on a single charge; and we know they’ll empty our wallet of $159 should we decide they’re the perfect fit for our shiny new iPhone 7.

What we don’t know, however, is whether they’ll keep slipping out of our ears.

Costing as much as they do, the sensation of one of the earpieces slipping from our ear is likely to be as scary as it is annoying. Conan O’Brien, evidently aware of such concerns, this week came up with an amusing spoof ad (above) that draws its inspiration from those classic Apple commercials broadcast around 10 years ago. O’Brien clearly believes the AirPods are set to become a real money-spinner for the Cupertino company – so long as people keep losing them.

Questioned on the burning issue during an appearance on Good Morning America this week, Apple CEO Tim Cook insisted that up to now, when trying out the AirPods, they’ve not once dropped out.

“I’ve been on treadmills, walking, doing all the things you normally do … and I have never personally had one fall out” Cook said, adding that “snipping the wires” actually makes them more secure than wired alternatives as they don’t get caught on things or slip out through their own weight.

The iPhone 7 launches today, but we won’t find out how secure the AirPods are till the end of next month, which is when they go on sale.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Dell has never been shy about offering Linux on its devices in order to make fans of the OS happy while shaving a few bucks off the full price. The savings come from users not needing to spend money on the Windows license. Two of the company’s latest models are getting the same treatment with Dell rolling out an XPS 13 and M3800 Developer Edition, both of which come with Ubuntu 14.04.1 installed.

The M3800 with Ubuntu is available now, and getting rid of Windows 8.1 carves a savings of $101.50 from the price tag. This means the starting price is $1533.50, which is certainly not cheap, but for users planning to replace Windows with Linux anyway, not being forced to spend extra for the OS is a solid deal.

One major complaint users had about Dell’s previous Ubuntu offering, the XPS 13 Developer Edition, was that they wanted a larger, more powerful model, and Dell is delivering here. The M3800’s 15.6 inch display features a UHD resolution of 3,840 × 2,160. That’s powered by a fourth generation Intel Core i7 quad-core processor, up to 16GB of RAM and NVIDIA Quadro K1100M graphics.

A minor issue users will have with the Ubuntu version is the fact 14.04.1 does not support the M3800’s Thunderbolt 2.o port. However, Dell is promising that with the upcoming Ubuntu 14.04.2 release, support for it will be added, so users will only have to deal with not having access to the port for a short period of time.

As for the XPS 13, Dell has not started selling the newest Linux-toting model as of this writing. In a Dell blog post, the company said that the fourth generation XPS 13 will be available soon, though it did not offer an exact release date for the updated version.

As everyone knows, tasmanian camels never go backwards, especially when on a precarious ledge. The camels will climb over each other, but only if there is a camel sized space on the other side. The camels didn't see each other until there was only exactly one camel's width between the two groups. How can all camels pass, allowing both groups to go on their way, without any camel reversing? Show Hint Show Solution Hint: Use match sticks or coins to simulate the puzzle. Solution: First a camel from one side moves forward, then two camels from the other side move forward, then three camels from the first side move forward etc...

2. The Waiter Three men in a cafe order a meal the total cost of which is $15. They each contribute $5. The waiter takes the money to the chef who recognizes the three as friends and asks the waiter to return $5 to the men. The waiter is not only poor at mathematics but dishonest and instead of going to the trouble of splitting the $5 between the three he simply gives them $1 each and pockets the remaining $2 for himself. Now, each of the men effectively paid $4, the total paid is therefore $12. Add the $2 in the waiters pocket and this comes to $14.....where has the other $1 gone from the original $15? Show Solution Solution: The payments should equal the receipts. It does not make sense to add what was paid by the men ($12) to what was received from that payment by the waiter ($2) Although the initial bill was $15 dollars, one of the five dollar notes gets changed into five ones. The total the three men ultimately paid is $12, as they get three ones back. So from the $12 the men paid, the owner receives $10 and the waiter receives the $2 difference. $15 - $3 = $10 + $2.

3. The Boxes There are three boxes. One is labeled "APPLES" another is labeled "ORANGES". The last one is labeled "APPLES AND ORANGES". You know that each is labeled incorrectly.

Started camping here in 2010 and immediately fell in love with the place. SBISP is the best deal on PIB, hotels/houses are very expensive to book, so camping is a great alternative. I am unsure how the crowd is during the week at the SBISP, but during the weekends they are packed. Christmas in July is ALWAYS sold out, so if you plan to camp during that weekend you have to book 6 months in advance. (trust me) Price for camping is very reasonable, basically $65/ campsite, but when you factor in price per person it is around $10/person. Everyone that is staying there is there to party, quiet time is after 10pm. Alcohol, though it states you cannot drink, everyone does, just put it in a red solo cup, the rangers are extremely cool as long as you show them respect, and remember to clean up prior to leaving. SBISP has remained successful because people respect the rules, by doing this, authority figures allow some of the rules to be bent, i.e. drinking. They say 6 people per campsite, and I believe 2 or 3 tents per site, honestly, I have never had a problem, I've rented two sites next to each other with almost 20 people total staying there along with 8 tents set up, again, respect the rules and they look the other way on small things. Bathrooms are alright, remind me of a typical park bathroom, this isn't the Ritz Carlton, but they do have outlets in the bathrooms. Showers have hardly any pressure, but are manageable. They now allow two cars per pad, (extra fee for second car) Campfire wood is few and far between, (you cannot bring wood over from the mainland), you can however purchase some. Only one cab company runs inside SBISP, others pickup/drop-off at the entrance into the grounds. One of the cool things (safety) is that late night dropoffs (1am+), you are greeted by an officer checking to see who you are and where exactly you are staying in SBISP. He is extremely friendly and is just doing his job to keep any unwelcome guest from disturbing the campers, show him some respect. In summary; SBISP is a great cheap alternative that still boast all the same amenities that any other part of the island would offer. I would not think twice

Whether it was your favorite toy or the last portion of mashed potatoes, anyone who grew up with a sibling knows that you learn to forcefully stake your claim to what’s rightfully yours.

It turns out that a similar idea can be applied to robots.

In a new piece of research — presented at the recent 2017 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) — engineers from Google and Carnegie Mellon University demonstrated that robots learn to grasp objects more robustly if another robot can be made to try and snatch it away from them while they’re doing so.

When one robot is given the task of picking up an object, the researchers made its evil twin (not that they used those words exactly) attempt to grab it from them. If the object isn’t properly held, the rival robot would be successful in its snatch-and-grab effort. Over time, the first robot learns to more securely hold onto its object — and with a vastly accelerated learning time, compared to working this out on its own.

“Robustness is a challenging problem for robotics,” Lerrel Pinto, a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute told Digital Trends. “You ideally want a robot to be able to transfer what it has learnt to environments that it hasn’t seen before, or even be stable to risks in the environment. Our adversarial formulation allows the robot to learn to adapt to adversaries, and this could allow the robot to work in new environments.”

The work uses deep learning technology, as well as insights from game theory: the mathematical study of conflict and cooperation, in which one party’s gain can mean the other party’s loss. In this case, a successful grab from the rival robot is recorded as a failure for the robot it grabbed the object from — which triggers a learning experience for the loser. Over time, the robots’ tussles make each of them smarter.

That sounds like progress — just as long as the robots don’t eventually form a truce and target us with their adversarial AI, we guess!<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Thereport highlights how global risks are not only interconnected but also have systemic impacts. To manage global risks effectively and build resilience to their impacts, better efforts are needed to understand, measure and foresee the evolution of interdependencies between risks, supplementing traditional risk-management tools with new concepts designed for uncertain environments. If global risks are not effectively addressed, their social, economic and political fallouts could be far-reaching, as exemplified by the continuing impacts of the financial crisis of 2007-2008.

The systemic nature of our most significant risks calls for procedures and institutions that are globally coordinated yet locally flexible. As international systems of finance, supply chains, health, energy, the Internet and the environment become more complex and interdependent, their level of resilience determines whether they become bulwarks of global stability or amplifiers of cascading shocks. Strengthening resilience requires overcoming collective action challenges through international cooperation among business, government and civil society.

Box 1: Objectives of the Global Risks 2014 Report The world faces risks that can be addressed only by long-term thinking and collaboration among business, governments and civil society. The Global Risks 2014 report aims to support this process by: exploring the nature of systemic risks

mapping 31 global risks according to the level of concern they arouse, their likelihood and potential impact, as well as the strength of the interconnections between them

looking in-depth at the ways in which three constellations of global risk – centred on youth, cyberspace and geopolitics – could interplay and have systemic impact

What's in a name? For the Greek god of the sun, Helios.

Say what? Helium is pronounced as HEE-lee-em.

History and Uses:

Helium, the second most abundant element in the universe, was discovered on the sun before it was found on the earth. Pierre-Jules-César Janssen, a French astronomer, noticed a yellow line in the sun's spectrum while studying a total solar eclipse in 1868. Sir Norman Lockyer, an English astronomer, realized that this line, with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometers, could not be produced by any element known at the time. It was hypothesized that a new element on the sun was responsible for this mysterious yellow emission. This unknown element was named helium by Lockyer.

The hunt to find helium on earth ended in 1895. Sir William Ramsay, a Scottish chemist, conducted an experiment with a mineral containing uranium called clevite. He exposed the clevite to mineral acids and collected the gases that were produced. He then sent a sample of these gases to two scientists, Lockyer and Sir William Crookes, who were able to identify the helium within it. Two Swedish chemists, Nils Langlet and Per Theodor Cleve, independently found helium in clevite at about the same time as Ramsay.

Helium makes up about 0.0005% of the earth's atmosphere. This trace amount of helium is not gravitationally bound to the earth and is constantly lost to space. The earth's atmospheric helium is replaced by the decay of radioactive elements in the earth's crust. Alpha decay, one type of radioactive decay, produces particles called alpha particles. An alpha particle can become a helium atom once it captures two electrons from its surroundings. This newly formed helium can eventually work its way to the atmosphere through cracks in the crust.

Helium is commercially recovered from natural

Client Fundación cidade da cultura de Galicia

Project Year 2011

Photographs Duccio Malagamba

Text description provided by the architects. The City of Culture is a new cultural center for the Province of Galicia in northwestern Spain. Its design evolves from the superposition of three sets of information. First, the street plan of the medieval center of Santiago is overlaid on a topographic map of the hillside site, which overlooks the city. Second, a modern Cartesian grid is laid over these medieval routes. Third, through computer modeling software, the topography of the hillside is allowed to distort the two flat geometries, thus generating a topological surface that repositions old and new in a simultaneous matrix never before seen.

The original center of Santiago conforms to a figure/ground urbanism in which buildings are figural, or solid, and the streets are residual, or void spaces. Through this mapping operation, the project emerges as a curving surface that is neither figure nor ground but both a figured ground and a figured figure that supersede the figure-ground urbanism of the old city. Santiago’s medieval past appears not as a form of representational nostalgia but as a new yet somehow familiar presence found in a new form.

The six buildings of the project are conceived as three pairs: the Museum of Galicia and the International Art Center; the Center for Music and Performing Arts and the Central Services building; and the Library of Galicia and the Galician Archives. Visitors’ experiences of any given building will be affected by its relationship to its immediate partner. The caminos, or pedestrian streets, between the buildings also open onto a public plaza, which is bordered by the six buildings and features landscape and water elements. The largest building is the Performing Arts Theater, which will stand 42.5 meters high. The heights of all of the buildings rise in gentle curves that seem to reconstruct the shape of the hilltop with their collective rooflines, which are all clad in stone and marked with the grids that inform the design of the site.

The Library of Galicia and Galician Archives opened their doors on January 11, 2011, during a ceremony presided over by the Prince and Princess of Asturias. The 17,372-square-meter Library will accommodate one million books in open stacks, rare book archives,

The 13 largest multi-channel video providers in the U.S. (Comcast, DirecTV and Verizon FiOS, to name three), who make up roughly 94 percent of the market share, lost about 105,000 video subscribers in 2013 — a wide 280,000-subscriber swing from 2012’s addition of 175,000. Perhaps most directly responsible for this first-ever net loss is the increasingly out-of-control hemorrhaging of subscribers on the part of top cable companies: about 1.7 million customers cut their cords in 2013.

Despite the loss equaling only 0.1 percent of all subscribers, 2013 nonetheless marks the first year in which pay-TV giants actually came out with an overall year-end loss, according to a recent report by Leichtman Research Group. Cord-cutters the world over are muttering, “You have to start somewhere.”

Specifically, cable companies took the biggest hit — technically, the only hit to actually result in a net loss.

Top telephone service providers AT&T U-verse and Verizon FiOS, along with top satellite TV companies DirecTV and DISH, added a total of roughly 1.6 million new video subscribers in 2013; a total that counteracts the 1.7 million lost cable video subscribers. Thus, the total amount of subscribers among all top multi-channel video providers fell for the first time, by about 105,000, which, in the grand scheme of things, isn’t all that much. There are about 94.6 million total subscribers currently at stake with the aforementioned multi-channel video providers.

While the loss is far from monumental, it could be interpreted as a sign of the times. Those that are wary of the recent moves by big pay-TV players, such as the Comcast-Time Warner merge, may find solace in this report. Though it should be expected that any big changes will be incremental, It’s like trying to make a 180-degree turn with the Titanic: there might not appear to be any considerable progress at any one time, but it’s turning — slowly but surely.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

At $84,000 ($1,000 per pill), Gilead Sciences Inc.'s new hepatitis C drug is a pricey cure. It's also highly effective, producing 90% cure rates in trials and a reduction in side effects and other complications. Some argue it's the most important drug approved this year, offering hope to many afflicted with the viral disease.

But the price of the drug, Sovaldi, is a threat to the efforts attempting to ease up on medical costs and relieve taxpayers. Senators Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) sent a letter to Gilead requesting an explanation for the drug's high cost.

"It is unclear how Gilead set the price for Sovaldi," the senators wrote in the letter, which was sent to the biopharmaceutical company on Friday, June 11. "That price appears to be higher than expected given the costs of development and production and the steep discounts offered in other countries."

Pharmasset originally developed the hepatitis C drug and intended to price the therapy at $36,000. In 2011, Gilead Sciences acquired Pharmasset for $11 billion. Before the buy, Phramasset was working on the drug with Bristol-Myers Squibb, a company that was developing a combination drug that some said worked better. Possibly in an attempt to launch the drug faster, Gilead dropped Bristol-Myers Squibb after it acquired Pharmasset.

Sovaldi could become one of the top-selling pharmaceutical therapies, as sales are projected to hit $8 billion this year. The senators argue that this will also increase Medicare and Medicaid costs.

Previously in March, House Democrats had also sent a letter to Gilead asking for an explanation of their intended price tag.

"This letter is a 'bank shot' that gets things going, with the goal of getting Gilead to significantly lower the price of Sovaldi," said Terry Haines, a political strategist. It was intended not only to put pressure on the company, but also to motivate other lawmakers to band together in the effort.

"Our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it," the letter said.

Hepatitis C, a contagious liver disease, can be fatal when left untreated. Approximately 3 million people suffer from the illness, and that number is expected to steadily rise. It spreads through contact with an infected person's blood. While the infection can be short-term, the chances of short-term

Sanskrit is the most suitable language for computer software, according to a report in Forbes magazine, July 1987. The World's first university was established in Takshila in 700BC. More than 10,500 students from all over the world studied more than 60 subjects there. The University of Nalanda built in the 4th century BC was one of the greatest achievements of ancient India in the field of education. Ayurveda is the earliest school of medicine known to humans. Charaka, the father of medicine consolidated Ayurveda 2500 years ago. Today Ayurveda is fast regaining its rightful place in our civilization.India was the richest country on earth until the British invaded in the early 17th Century. Christopher Columbus was attracted by India's wealth. Bhaskaracharya calculated the time taken by the earth to orbit the sun hundreds of years before the astronomer Smart. Time taken by earth to orbit the sun in the 5th century - 365.258756484 days. The art of navigation was born in the river Sindh 6000 years ago. The very word Navigation is derived from the Sanskrit word NAVGATIH. The word navy is also derived from Sanskrit 'Nou'. The value of "pi" was first calculated by Budhayana, and he explained the concept of what is known as the Pythagorean Theorem. He discovered this in the 6th century long before the European mathematicians. According to the Gemological Institute of America, up until 1896, India was the only source for diamonds to the world. Algebra, trigonometry and calculus came from India. Quadratic equations were by Sridharacharya in the 11th century. The largest numbers the Greeks and the Romans used were 106 whereas Hindus used numbers as big as 10**53(10 to the power of 53) with specific names as early as 5000 BCE during the Vedic period.

<|begin_of_text|>How many atoms are there in a kilogram of silicon? This number is Avogadro’s constant and working out its value is one of the more important tasks that materials scientists face.

Today, a group of physicists reveal the answer. They say there are 6.02214084(18) × 10^23 atoms in a single crystal of silicon weighing about a kilogram. And they say they know this is right because they’ve counted them. Yep, counted them.

Actually, they counted the number of atoms in a unit volume of silicon and measured the size of this volume. The number of times this fits into a lump of exactly 1 mole of near perfect single crystal sphere of silicon is Avogadro’s number.

To have established this number to such accuracy is clearly an important piece of work but just how impressive is put in perspective by the monumental efforts of the international consortium behind it.

The work began in 2004 when a Russian group created a sample of silicon flouride with a specific isotopic content at the Central Design Bureau of Machine Building in St. Petersburg. A team at the Institute of Chemistry of High-Purity Substances of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Nizhny-Novgorod then turned this into a polycrystal of silicon hydride which a group at the Leibniz-Institut fur Kristallzuchtung in Berlin used to grow a 5kg lump of pure monocrystalline silicon in 2007.

The Australian Centre for Precision Optics then took samples from this lump and shaped them into quasi-perfect spheres. They then made an x-ray interferometer from the left over silicon to determine its crystal structure. They also measured crystals’ surfaces to see what kind of crud had built up there and would therefore have to be taken into account in the final calculations. (Various copper, nickel and silicon oxides had built up on the surface.)

Various groups then measured the mass of the spheres by comparing them to the platinum-iridium test kilograms owned by the PTB (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt) in Germany, the National Metrology Institute of Japan in Tskuba and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures in France.

The team then measured the volume of the spheres using optical interferometry. And the isotope content was measured by teams at the University of Warsaw, the Institute of Mineral Resources of the Chinese Academy of Science and Institute for Physics of Microstructures of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

As of this month, 6 percent of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus owners use Apple Pay, up from 5 percent in November 2014, according to “Apple Pay By The Numbers: Adoption And Behavior,” a report presented at Innovation Project 2015 by payments-focused company PYMNTS.com and shopper insights company InfoScout. Meanwhile, 9 percent of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus owners have tried Apple Pay but aren’t currently using it, up from 4 percent in November.

This means 85 percent of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus owners have never touched Apple Pay. This is down from 91 percent in November, but it still spotlights an uphill battle for adoption.

“The main reason those who had tried Apple Pay in the past, but didn’t on some transactions where it was available, seems to be forgetfulness – almost a third (32 percent) said they just forgot it was an option,” according to PYMNTS.com.

Apple should be “dead-focused” on point-of-sale and make sure there’s a trigger to compel users to use their phone instead of their card to pay, according to Jared Schrieber, co-founder and CEO of InfoScout.

“Apple Pay is not yet salient. When it comes up, it has not registered with the [consumer] that they should use Apple Pay,” Schrieber said. “There’s something lacking there in the habit-forming action at checkout.”

The report also notes that 31 percent of surveyed users didn’t know whether the Apple Pay-friendly merchant they were shopping at accepted the mobile payments option. Meanwhile, 20 percent of respondents said they prefer a different payment method.

The 6 percent of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus owners who regularly use Apple Pay have positive impressions of the service, as 79 percent said it was more convenient, 77 percent said it was faster, 73 percent said it was easier to use and 70 percent said it was more secure.

Despite the hype and eagerness of some users to make six-month-old Apple Pay a mainstream success, the current approach “doesn’t look promising,” according to David Evans, founder of management consulting firm Market Platform Dynamics.

“Apple will need to either figure out a way to broaden the base of

You can’t be what you can’t see, and I see a lack of women leaders in my industry.

Despite good intentions from most people, unconscious bias and structural inequality still leads us to a world where women and minorities are extremely underrepresented in Silicon Valley. We can do better.

After being in this industry for almost a decade, I’ve learned that given the existing inequalities, the only way to make real change is to go out of your way to do so. It’s important to acknowledge that there is already bias in your criteria, whether for hiring, promoting, or investing. So you must go out of your way to champion women and underrepresented minorities.

I don’t tweet about it a lot, but I’m an active angel investor. In the last three years, I’ve made nine investments, and three of them were in companies with women CEOs. 33% doesn’t feel good enough, though sadly this is likely higher than the ratio for most venture firms and angels. So I’ve decided to take it one step further.

I’m committing that the next nine angel investments I make will only be in companies run by women CEOs, without exception.

Recently, I’ve become a Sequoia Scout, so some of my investments will involve Sequoia’s capital. But my promise to only invest in women stands whether or not the funds are from my personal capital or Sequoia’s.

I think Supreme Court Justice Ruth Ginsburg sums it up quite nicely:<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Apple is known for its crazy patents, but some of them are much more realistic. On Tuesday, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted the company a patent for a special construction process that involves LiquidMetal and sapphire glass displays. The patent approval occurred right after Apple announced that it has exclusive rights to LiquidMetal’s unique alloy until 2015.

In scientific terms, LiquidMetal is a bulk amorphous alloy and is considered an exotic metal. It may look like a metal in liquid form, but it moves like molten plastic. So far, LiquidMetal has only been used to make a SIM card ejector, some military equipment, and medical devices. The technology has been put to the test, but it has never been used to create a consumer smartphone or tablet. Nonetheless, it seems that Apple may have plans to forge its future iPhones and iPads using the LiquidMetal technology.

Apple’s patent describes the new use it has in mind for LiquidMetal and how it will aid in stabilizing the sapphire glass displays in future iDevices. Stabilization is necessary, so that when you inevitably drop your iPhone, the glass doesn’t shatter or simply pop off. Back in 2007, Apple used a plastic chassis and a rubberized gasket to protect the display from sudden impacts. This technology is still used in all other iPhone models up to the iPhone 5S.

The new patent aims to avoid all these annoying in-between steps and go directly from the metal chassis to the display, using LiquidMetal in a new metal injection molding process. That way, Apple can form sapphire glass directly into the iPhone or iPad’s metal bezel. The patent indicates that plastic can also be used, but the emphasis is on the idea of using LiquidMetal to ensure the strongest bond and protection between the glass display and metal chassis.

Clearly, this technology is very cutting edge, but its application is untested in mobile devices, so don’t get too pumped up, thinking LiquidMetal will debut with the iPhone 6 this September (or August, depending on which rumors you believe. Read our roundup here). However, given Apple’s agreement with GT Technologies to manufacture enormous amounts of sapphire glass, it’s probably safe to assume that a sapphire glass display is forthcoming on the long-awaited iPhone 6.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

As long as you haven’t been living under a rock for the past several months, then you have probably heard at least something about the sudden rise in value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These are the two most popular cryptocurrencies, both of which have seen gains of over 300% in just about 3 month’s time.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two most popular cryptocurrencies available, there are literally dozens upon dozens of others as well, and these cryptos trade on an open market daily. One such example is the Swarm City Cryptocurrency (SWT). In reality Swarm City is a “token” based on the aforementioned Ethereum cryptocurrency, and by viewing the technical analysis of recent trades, I am led to believe that now is a tremendous time to buy in. You see, technical analysis views trends, resistance, moving averages, etc. of an investment vehicle. This analysis is considered daily when trading stocks and foreign exchange currency, and now is being increasingly used in the trading of various cryptocurrencies and tokens.

Today, Swarm City (SWT) appears to have met resistance (see photo to the right). It’s a level that the trading value of the cryptocurrency broke toward the end of last month and then shot up nearly 200% before falling back down just recently. Currently Swarm City is again at this level, this time from above, so I expect to see it bounce off this level and shoot up once again.

If you then take a look at the daily chart (below), you will see that there is another level of resistance where Swarm City has bounced off of in the past. I expect the last red candle on this chart to drop back and for it to be followed by multiple green candles, representing a surge forward in the crypto.

It’s possible that it will ultimately break this resistance level, and fall to the next level of resistance at 0.00075, but my guess is that we will see the bounce now at around 0.11600. If this bounce occurs, I expect to see Swarm City shoot up at least to the 0.002 level but perhaps past the 0.0025 level.

(note: This article is my opinion only, and I am a trader of Swarm City. Currently I own the cryptocurrency.)<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Problem 1.1: Above, we saw that \(n^2\), a quadratic, had a linear sequence as its finite differences. Prove this for the general quadratic.

If the sequence is \(A n^2 + B n + C\), the finite differences are of the form \(A[(n+1)^2 - n^2] + B[(n+1) - n] + C[1 - 1] = (2A)n + (A + B)\), which is linear

Problem 1.2: What would be the corresponding theorem for cubics? Prove it.

We know that the cubic is of the form \(A n^3 + q(n)\), where \(q(n)\) is quadratic. Our finite differences are \(A [(n+1)^3 - n^{3}] + [q(n+1) - q(n)]\). The finite differences of the second term are linear and of the first are quadratic, so the overall differences are quadratic.

Problem 1.3: Extend the above to general $n$-th order polynomials.

Induct. When you expand \((n+1)^k - n^k\), we get a polynomial of degree \(k-1\); induct downward on \(k\).

Problem 2.1: The "Tribonacci" sequence is defined by \(T_{n+3} = T_{n+2} + T_{n+1} + T_n\) and starting values \(T_1 = T_2 = T_3 = 1\). What is the smallest \(n\) for which \(T_n\) is over 9000? Over \(10^{10}\)? A calculator might be helpful, but don't just brute force the answer.

I warn you, this problem is somewhat hard. Let's begin. We first find the characteristic polynomial, \(P(\lambda) = \lambda^3 - \lambda^2 - \lambda - 1\). Now we need to find roots, but this polynomial does not factor in any nice way. What you can do, however, is estimate. \(P(1) = 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 = -2\), and \(P(2) = 8 - 4 - 2 - 1 = 1\), so we know that our answer is close to 2. We can check \(1.8\) or so, and we

Are Germaine Greer and Richard Dawkins being transphobic? Johanna argues that their perspective is wrong because they both dehumanify gender and empty it of its subjectivity.

Beyond calling transphobia “transphobia”, we have very few ways of describing what is specifically wrong with bigotism directed towards transgender people (or people perceived to be transgender). It’s a truism that trans-conversations take about six times as long as a normal conversation because we have to use and often explain so much jargon that is unfamiliar to most people and even may transpeople themselves. We need better, more concise and descriptively intuitive terms to describe the kinds of abuse we face to help educate others why they are wrong.

For instance calling Greer’s words an assault would be disingenuous. They’re a presumably an honest opinion, and not really directed at any specific individuals, but rather are a discriminatory attitude and mode of thinking that she broadcast to the world.

So what was she doing? Why was what she said so vile and objectionable?

Simply put, she was attempting to take gender away from transpeople. We are labelled as (trans-)eunuchs by “de-gendering” us. Gender is a fundamental human characteristic. Everyone has one, and though most people have conventional binary genders, they are still within the spectrum of possible genders. No one tries to take cisgendered people’s gender away without an outcry!

Hence, “degendering”. Adjective: to literally or figuratively attempt to remove a person’s self-determined gender and/or the act of physically removing gender characteristics from a person.

So this is what Greer did wrong: “she degendered us”, and compare that idea to things like being “emasculated” or the kind of misogyny that insidiously devalues women. Because it really is the same thing just with a different target.

We can also describe potential social-consequences of ‘degendering’ by comparing it to ‘outing’ someone, or stigmatising a skin colour, a religion or even being cis-gendered. “Degendering”, we argue, is what Richard Dawkins demonstrated with his tweet dated 5:34 am, 26th October, 2015.

“Is a trans-woman a woman? Purely semantic. If you define by chromosomes, no. If by self-identification, yes. I call her ‘she’ out of courtesy.”

Fresh grime styles.

On the cover for his new album, Safe, Louis Carnell looks like he's just awoken from a cryogenic freeze. It's an appropriate image. His tracks as Visionist sound as if they were made in an icy cave. Carnell uses wordless vocal samples and glassy synths to create an ethereal, almost choral take on grime. The South Londoner has been honing his style for the last few years, releasing on respected, boundary-pushing labels like Lit City Trax, Diskotopia, Leisure System and Left Blank. He's been a key name in the recent wave of creativity that's swept instrumental grime, but instead of focusing on rhythmic innovation or experimental sonics like many of his peers, Carnell's channelled emotions. On the two-part I'm Fine series he explored the five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. "The sharply honed dance music motifs that swim in the vast space seem untethered from any club context, instead pointing in on themselves," said Maya Kalev in her review of Part II. Similarly, Safe, which is released this week through PAN, sees Carnell confronting his struggles with anxiety. "I needed to make it a challenging listen to reflect this," he says below. The album's 15 tracks push Carnell's template further than ever before—the beats are tougher, the vocals more dense, the atmospheres chillier.

Along with his own work, Carnell is doing plenty to keep grime and its offshoots moving forward. His Lost Codes label gave early releases to trailblazers like Filter Dread, Sd Laika, Bloom and Acre, and the imprint was recently reborn as CODES, with PAN's Bill Kouligas coming on board. On RA.488 Carnell showcases plenty of artists in this ilk alongside cuts from Safe, resulting in a 42-minute, 27-track sonic blast.

What have you been up to recently?

Since the album finished, I have been working hard on my upcoming live shows. The first one is premiering at Unsound festival next week. Also keeping it busy with a lot of upcoming releases and new artists we're working with for our new label CODES, which I co-run with Bill from PAN.

How and where was the mix recorded?

It was recorded live straight in Logic, on CDJs and Serato in my flatmate's room.

Can you tell us about the idea behind the mix?

‘Awkward’ is a great word to describe the public relationship between President Donald Trump and his beautiful wife Melania. Over the last 8 months or so, the American people have been given a front row seat into a relationship which seems to be filled with strife. After all, what marriage wouldn’t have its issues when one of the two people involved were caught on camera saying they like to grab women by the ‘pussy’, right?

We have seen Melania make faces of disgust behind her husband’s back, refuse to hold his hand on numerous occasions, and only show affection when it seems like she almost has to. With all that said, yesterday’s antics at military facility Joint Base Andrews, may take the cake for the most awkward moment yet, since Trump’s presidency began nearly eight months ago.

Melania Trump was on hand to introduce her husband to the service men and women at the base in Maryland.

“It’s my great pleasure to introduce my husband, the President of the United States, Donald Trump,” stated Melania.

As she concluded her remarks, the President slowly stepped towards her, shook her hand and then appeared to almost push or guide her off stage. Such actions would appear to be normal, had the person introducing him been another male politician or statesman, however it almost appeared as if President Trump had forgotten that this was his wife he was dealing with. A kiss, or a long hug certainly would not have been out of the ordinary in this situation.

While rumors have surfaced that Melania had prepared to divorce the President prior to him unexpectedly winning the 2016 election, the event witnessed yesterday appears to show that there is a clear lack of affection within this marriage.

a P = c t P = 299792458 m / s 5.39116 × 10 − 44 s {\displaystyle a_{\text{P}}={\frac {c}{t_{\text{P}}}}={\frac {299792458\ m/s}{5.39116\times 10^{-44}\ s}}}

≈ 5.560815 × 10 51 m / s 2 {\displaystyle \approx 5.560815\times 10^{51}\ m/s^{2}}

≈ 5.670453 × 10 50 g {\displaystyle \approx 5.670453\times 10^{50}\ g}

where a P is the Planck acceleration, c is the speed of light, t P is the Planck time[1] and g is the standard acceleration of gravity.[2]

Meaning [ edit ]

The Planck acceleration is the highest acceleration conceivable in the Universe, as the speed of light is the highest possible speed and the Planck time is the shortest possible duration of any meaningful physical process. This limitation does assume that relativity has natural units. However, it is not clear whether any object in the Universe actually reaches or can reach the Planck acceleration. One event where the Planck acceleration was possibly reached was the Big Bang, in regard to the acceleration of the expanding Universe during the Planck epoch. Also, within a black hole, such acceleration might be possible beyond its horizon, but that is certainly unknown (and what lies beyond a horizon is beyond the reach of physical observation).

In a classical description, photons emanating from their subluminal source (for example, a particle-antiparticle collision) experience zero acceleration, as they always travel at the speed of light. However, since the Planck time is the least conceivable delay, the "instantaneous" production of a photon pair can not be distinguished from the acceleration of a photon from zero to the speed of light in a Planck time, thereby achieving a Planck acceleration. In other words, nothing higher than the Planck acceleration can be measured, since that would imply measuring a time interval shorter than the Planck time.

<|begin_of_text|>Question: How many teachers still need to be hired at B.C. schools?

a) A lot, considering students are already one month into the school year.

b) Officially, 400, according to the number of postings on the B.C. Public School Employers’ website.

c) Far more than that, given that some postings are for multiple specialist positions and on-call teachers.

d) All of the above.

The correct answer is d. And the reason is as complicated as the start of this school year has been.

The Supreme Court of Canada ruling that reduced class sizes and required B.C. to hire 3,500 new teachers sparked unprecedented movement of teachers between education districts and a wave of new hires — which continues today.

“It’s challenging to pinpoint exact numbers, because the posting process right now is very fluid,” said Janet Stewart, chief administrative officer of the Public School Employers’ Association. “It’s quite a bit of a domino effect. So, to be looking at the posting numbers tells a more complex story.”

Stewart’s organization, which negotiates on behalf of school boards to get new teachers hired, said there are 400 postings for new teachers in B.C. right now. But each of those postings can represent multiple vacancies, and those vacancies can be for full-time, part-time or on-call work.

ON-CALL TEACHERS IN HIGH DEMAND

A Postmedia analysis of the postings on the website from early this week reveals vacancies for more than 900 full- or part-time jobs, in addition to 1,000 schools looking for on-call teachers.

Stewart said some of those postings are technically filled because in some cases the temporary teacher currently in the classroom will be officially hired once the paperwork is completed. In other cases, the person temporarily filling the role doesn’t want the job permanently so new teachers still need to be found — often in specialist roles.

Multiple school boards, including Burnaby, Coquitlam and the all-French Conseil Scolaire Francophone, have indicated multiple vacancies for bilingual teachers or librarians, which are always hard to find in B.C.

“We definitely have higher volumes this year and we definitely have pressure points around those highly specialized positions in particular,” Stewart said. “I’m hopeful it will calm down (this month).”

She also said that the data doesn’t mean 1,000 additional on-call teachers necessarily need to be hired in B.C., because schools share a pool of on-call teachers run by the district, and some work

NEW DELHI: Controversial preacher Zakir Naik’s NGO Islamic Research Foundation (IRF) had allegedly offered a second donation of Rs 25 lakh to Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust (RGCT) in December 2011, months afterthat is already in the public realm.Documents seized during raids onshow that it had wanted the Rs 25 lakh donation to RGCT to be routed via Mumbai-based M H Saboo Siddique Maternity and General Hospital, but the hospital ended up utilizing the money itself after IRF kept vacillating on who should be the end beneficiary. Besides RGCT, it had also recommended Allahabad-based Kamla Nehru Memorial Hospital Society, and KARM, an NGO in Mumbai.Significantly, according to resolutions passed by IRF in June-July and November 2011, the two donations of Rs 50 lakh and Rs 25 lakh were extended to RGCT on the basis of applications received from the trust which has Congress president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi on its board of trustees. This contrasts with Congress’s claim, made when the Rs 50 lakh donation became public, that it never solicited donation from IRF. RGCT did not respond to TOI’s queries based on the documents in its possession.When contacted, IRF spokesperson Arif Malik said that given that“IRF does not have access to its records and hence cannot check donations made in the past”.As per documents with TOI, in case of both the donations, applications were received from RGCT, New Delhi, and placed before IRF’s board of trustees.The papers show that IRF, at a meeting of its trustees in November 2011, passed a resolution stating that applications for medical and educational aid was received from M H Saboo Siddique Hospital, RGCT and Bandra Education Society.The meeting resolved to donate Rs 5 lakh to the hospital as medical aid and Rs 5 lakh to the society as educational aid. It “further resolved that Rs 30,00,000 be donated to M H Saboo Siddique... hospital out of which they should retain Rs 5,00,000 and further donate Rs 25,00,000 to RGCT.” According to the documents, Rs 30 lakh was given to the hospital vide cheque No.964635 dated December 19, 2011.While RGCT did not respond

As recent graduate Pieter Smakman explained in a guest post in Sparkisan, “body parts are still very hard to scan due to their agile nature.” Whereas static objects are relatively straightforward and simple, a human limb has many nuances that make them considerably more difficult to fully process and understand (from a machine’s point of view, that is). So to address this issue, Smakman “developed the first dedicated and low-cost 3D Hand Scanner.”

With Raspberry Pis, laser pointers, and a total of 32 cameras, Smakman claims that his scanner “is able to create a precise surface model of the hand,” which in turn “opens a new world of possibilities: think of 3D printed braces, personalized medical instruments, and a long-awaited tool for everyone who designs products that interact with the human hand.”

For now, this world is one that only exists in hypotheticals — Smakman’s design is one of a kind and has yet to be reproduced, much less made available to the general public. But if it ever does come to fruition, it’s sure to have a major impact on the way our hands (and the rest of our bodies) are able to interact with the world.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

So how big is it, exactly? Well, according to our best estimates, the supermassive black hole is roughly 21 billion times the size of the Sun, and its event horizon (an area so dense and powerful that light can’t escape its gravity) measures 130 billion kilometers in diameter. That’s about 15 times the diameter of Neptune’s orbit around the Sun, according to scientists at the Hubble Space Telescope. At one point, the black hole was fueling itself on a process called hot accretion. Space stuff like gases, dust, and galactic debris fell towards the black hole and created an accretion disk. Then that spinning disk of space junk, accelerated by the strong gravitational pull of the largest known black hole, emitted huge jets of energy out into the galaxy.

During that active period, NGC 4889 would have classified as a quasar (quasi-stellar radio source) thanks to the black hole’s emissions of up to a thousand times more energy than our Milky Way galaxy. But the black hole is now in dormant mode because there isn’t any more sustenance stored in the orbiting accretion disk. “The accretion disk sustained the supermassive black hole’s appetite until the nearby supply of galactic material was exhausted. Now, napping quietly as it waits for its next celestial snack, the supermassive black hole is dormant”, says the Hubble Space Telescope website.

Of course, the announcement posted with new photos of the NGC 4889 galaxy is quick to point out that the pictures don’t exactly capture the likeness of the supermassive black hole. It is impossible to observe a black hole directly, but scientists have been able to identify the implied presence of a black hole by analyzing the way celestial objects interact with some invisible force. For this particular black hole in the NGC 4889 galaxy, scientists used instruments on the Keck II Observatory and the Gemini North Telescope to measure the velocity of stars moving around the center point of the galaxy. The stars’ specific velocities re what allowed scientists to calculate the incredible size of NGC 4889’s black hole.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

From co-creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, the FX series American Horror Story uses a unique and compelling approach to television, with a different setting, different characters and a rotating cast of actors for each season. For Season 3, American Horror Story: Coven has told the secret history of witches and witchcraft in America, with a cast of talented actresses that included Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates, Angela Bassett, Patti LuPone, Sarah Paulson, Frances Conroy, Lily Rabe, Taissa Farmiga, Emma Roberts, Gabourey Sidibe and even Stevie Nicks.

During this exclusive phone interview with Collider, actress Angela Bassett talked about how she came to be a part of the show this season, how it was the best of all worlds, bringing the history of the real woman to her portrayal in the present day, talking to actual voodouns, how invaluable it was to really get to shoot in New Orleans, and that she would absolutely be willing to entertain the idea of returning to the series, for a future season. Check out what she had to say after the jump.

ANGELA BASSETT: My agent reached out to Ryan [Murphy] and said, “What about Angela, for American Horror Story?” And he was like, “Yes, because she’s who I’m thinking of for Marie Laveau.” So, they reached out to me and said that I should go in and take a meeting with him for the character. I didn’t know that I was his choice for that. I was familiar with the show, but I hadn’t watched it because I don’t really like horror shows, horror movies, or any of that. I’m really a lightweight, in terms of that. But, I watched both seasons before going in to meet him. And I’m definitely a fan of Marie Laveau and New Orleans. What I saw, in addition to the horror, was that the writing was so wonderful and the characters were so realized. It wasn’t just fright night, so I could appreciate that. So, I went in to meet him and he told me what he wanted to do. New Orleans is one of my favorite cities, and I knew something about the historical figure of Marie Laveau, so I was excited about that, and I think he could see that in me. I don’t think the country, as a whole,

Updated on 12-19-2014 by Andy Boxall: Added in details of the ZenWatch’s UK launch.

November 9 U.S. release

If you want to get your hands on the ZenWatch, Asus announced it will launch on November 9 at Best Buy. The Android Wear-powered smartwatch has also made its way to the Google Play Store, but regardless of where you buy it, the watch will cost you $200. There’s no word on whether other retailers, such as Amazon, will sell the ZenWatch, though its price point puts it on par with other Android Wear smartwatches.

December 23 release in the UK

The Asus ZenWatch will go on sale in the UK on December 23 for £200, or about $310, making it considerably more expensive than in America. According to Pocket-lint.com, the watch will be an exclusive to high street electronics retailers Currys and PC World. Online retailer Clove Technology has a holding page for the watch, suggesting it may not be exclusive for all that long.

Asus’ smartwatch was originally slated to arrive in stores sometime between late summer and the end of 2014, so it’s arguably still on target. A rumor circulated at the beginning of October warned us the ZenWatch may be in very limited supply at first.

Curved screen, smart looks

The screen made from 2.5D curved glass and looks slightly oval in shape with its rounded edges. The AMOLED panel measures 1.63-inches and features a resolution of 320 x 320 pixels. Asus created many customizable watch faces for you to choose from, amounting to more than 100 combinations.

The ZenWatch comes with a 1.2GHz Snapdragon 400 processor and 512MB of RAM. The watch has 4GB of internal storage, a 1.4Wh battery, Bluetooth 4.0, and is waterproof with an IP55 rating. The ZenWatch is, of course, powered by Android Wear and features what Asus calls “What’s Next” smart notifications. What’s Next is really just Google Now, but with a few added features.

Asus added several cool functions to make the ZenWatch easier to use, including “Tap Tap,” a feature that asks your phone to ring so you can find it. All you have to do is tap twice on the screen. You can also cover the face of the ZenWatch when you need to mute phone

2 eggs

What could be better then pancakes? 2 Ingredient Banana Pancakes. These 2 ingredient banana pancakes are so simple and delicious. You’ve probably seen this recipe floating around the internet for quite some time now, I figured I better jump on the pancake bandwagon. I’m glad I did, and you’ll be glad too!

Directions for 2 Ingredient Banana Pancakes

All you need to make these amazing, delicious pancakes is a very ripe banana and 2 eggs. Throw it all in a blender (minus the shells and peel of course) and give it a whiz. Cook your pancakes just like a regular pancake! When they start to bubble it’s time to flip them!

The beautiful thing about these 2 ingredient banana pancakes is that they are so versatile. You can top them with butter and syrup, peanut butter, chocolate chips, berries – the pancakes are your oyster. Wait, gross. You know what I mean.

I chose to top mine with banana coins and melted peanut butter. These pancakes taste so delicious it’s hard to believe they aren’t loaded with sugar.

How about dem photography skills? I’m getting better! I finally discovered what those fancy symbols on my camera do. It’s a work in progress, but I absolutely love my camera. If anyone is interested I use this camera: Nikon D3100 14.2MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens

Trying some server side javascript injection in mongodb, I wondered if it would be possible to pop a shell.

But let’s dig a little bit.

> run function () { return nativeHelper.apply(run_, arguments); }

So you can run the “run” function directly by calling nativeHelper.apply(run_,[“uname”,”-a”]);

In server side, the result show us that nativeHelper.apply method exists!

Sometimes a little information can go a long way.

Something as simple as knowing when the stoplight coming up is going to change can have a profound effect on the way you choose to drive. If you know that you’re going to hit that red light no matter what you do, you might choose to ease up and just coast up to the light. Or if you know it’s about to go green, why slow down and then speed up again? That little bit of information can help smooth out your driving, and in the process, help smooth out traffic congestion as well.

Audi recently became the first automaker to offer Traffic Light Information as a fully integrated feature available on selected new vehicles including Audi A4, Q7, and A4 Allroad models. Other automakers (notably BMW) work with smartphone apps that provide similar information, but Audi’s solution does not depend on a paired phone running an app. It’s native to the car’s driver information system.

“The launch of this technology is another in a long list of firsts for Audi that have positioned us as the industry leader in connectivity solutions,” said Audi of America President Scott Keogh. “V2I applications and services like Traffic Light Information are essential components as we continue to move toward an autonomous future.”

How it works

The process of getting traffic light status info and predictions about light changes is fairly straightforward. The municipality where you’re driving shares its data with Audi, and Audi broadcasts the information to your car, where the data is compared with your car’s GPS data to determine which light you’re approaching. Then the car puts an icon and a counter up on the gauge pod driver information display, and into the head-up display projected onto the driver’s side of the windshield. The information displayed is simple: it shows a picture of a stoplight in its current state, red or green, plus a counter giving the system’s best prediction of when the light is likely to change.

There’s a key word hidden in that last sentence, and it’s “prediction.” Because there are some variables that can’t be precisely predicted, such as emergency vehicles that have the ability to change or hold a light as they approach, sometimes the system does not have full confidence about when the light will change. In that case, the Audi will not display the counter for you. The driver still has to obey the light, no matter what the dashboard display might say.

On the back end, things are more complicated. First of all,

A=432 Hz, known as Verdi’s ‘A’ is an alternative tuning that is mathematically consistent with the universe. Music based on 432Hz transmits beneficial healing energy, because it is a pure tone of math fundamental to nature.

The universal music of sacred geometry

According to Brian T. Collins, a musician and researcher, the standard pitch (A=440 Hz) does not harmonize on any level that corresponds to cosmic movement, rhythm, or natural vibration. The greatest musicians, such as Mozart and Verdi, based their music on the natural vibration of A=432. It’s true that it is only 8 vibrations per second different from the standard tuning, but this small difference seems to be remarkable to our human consciousness.

There’s a growing musical and metaphysical movement for recovering optimal integrity in the music industry and spirituality through the 432Hz tuning. In April 2008 Dutch journalist Richard Huisken founded the ‘back to 432 Hz’ committee, claiming that this original tuning was used in ancient cultures and is found on antique instruments like the Stradivarius violin.

The healing benefits

According to Richard Huisken, music tuned to 432 Hz is softer and brighter, giving greater clarity and is easier on the ears. Many people experience more meditative and relaxing states of body and mind when listening to such music. The natural musical pitch of the universe gives a more harmonic and pleasant sound than 440 Hz.

432 Hz seems to work at the heart chakra, “the feeling”, and therefore could have a good influence on the spiritual development of the listener. Some people who are not able to distinguish the 8hz difference claim they can feel the music warmer due to the longer wavelength.

Listen to 432Hz and enjoy living in balance

Because 432 Hz gives a greater clarity than 440 Hz, there’s less need to play it as loud as 440 Hz. This means less hearing damage, as long as you put the volume not too high. Furthermore there’s also less noise pressure. Researchers and musicians, such as Coreen Morsink (pianist and music teacher), report that they feel calmer, happier and more relaxed when playing music at 432Hz.

Music based on this natural tone is more transparent, more marked, gives an obvious musical picture and the overtones and undertones moves more freely. Music based on 440 Hz represents stuffed emotions and blocked energy. By lowering the pitch by just 8 Hz, you

The 22nd Amendment to the United States Constitution sets term limits for the elected President of the United States. Passed by the United States Congress on March 21, 1947, the 22nd Amendment was later ratified by the requisite number of states on the 27th of February in 1951.

The 22nd Amendment states that no personal shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice and no person who has already held office—or acted as the president of the United States—for more than two years of a term shall be elected President more than once.

The primary motive of this amendment was to establish term limits; the 22nd Amendment to the United States Constitution states that no US President shall be elected to more than two terms. Furthermore, the 22nd Amendment limits the maximum time an individual may be serve as President to 10 years, if the person should succeed to the office.

Original Text of the 22nd Amendment to the United States Constitution:

Section 1. No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once. But this article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this article was proposed by the Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term.

Section 2. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its submission to the States by the Congress.

History of the 22nd Amendment:

Historians cite George Washington’s unwillingness to seek office for a third term as evidence that the founding fathers saw the two-term limit as conventional. The constraint was instituted to impede the development of pseudo monarchy.

In addition to Washington, Thomas Jefferson also contributed to the two-term limit by suggesting an office without restraints could yield a “a President for life”, which would obfuscate the premise of a democratic government.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, among those paid by the hour, 1.6 million Americans earned the prevailing federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour in 2012. (The data for 2013 hasn’t been released yet.) Of these, 484,000 are aged 16 to 19.

So... the Democrats’ big idea on income inequality is one that will increase wages for... 1.1 percent of the workforce.

The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, although many states and localities require a higher wage by law. SeaTac, the municipality that surrounds Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, now requires $15 per hour. Democrats want to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour, an additional $2.85 per hour.

For a minimum-wage employee working 40 hours per week, that’s an additional $114 per week, before taxes.

For a 30-hour-per-week worker, we’re talking about an additional $85.50 per week.

With 1.6 million earning the federal minimum wage, averaging 35 hours per week, this would amount to $159.6 million in higher wages per week. That, times 52 weeks per year, amounts to about $8.2 billion. That may sound like a lot, but we have a $17 trillion economy.

In short, an America with a $10.10-per-hour minimum wage would look indistinguishable from the one we see today on the issue of income inequality, as well as the economic aspect that more conservatives focus on, opportunity for advancement. (Getting that first entry-level, minimum wage may get harder as each employee becomes more expensive to the employer.) The workers making minimum wage may very well appreciate the extra $85 to $114 per week, but it’s not going to have much of an impact on their purchasing power. Small companies on tight margins may find the $2.85-per-worker-per-hour cost more difficult to handle, or may raise prices. Of course, if prices go up... that will eat into the budgets of those minimum-wage workers pretty fast, won’t it?<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Perl has some “numbers” that aren’t really numbers. Or, it has them if your underlying C library supports them.

The first, the “not a number”, is the string “NaN”, in any case. This isn’t a single value. The standard for floating-point numbers, IEEE 754. This value, which isn’t a number, returns itself in any mathematical operation.

Before we look at that, though, remember what Perl does with strings that might be numbers. As we explain in the “Scalars” chapter, Perl grabs decimal number characters from the start of the string. When it encounters something that doesn’t look like it belongs in a decimal number, it stops. Whatever it grabbed so far becomes the number. For instance, "1234fred" becomes 1234 while "fred" becomes the empty string which becomes 0.

$ perl -le 'print "1234fred" + 1' 1235 $ perl -le 'print "fred" + 1' 1 $ perl -le 'print "1234fred" * 1' 1234 $ perl -le 'print "fred" * 1' 0

NaN

If we applied Perl’s basic rule to the string "NaN", we’d expect to get 0, because we didn’t tell you about this special value in Learning Perl. It’s one of the white lies we tell so we don’t fill your head with stuff you probably won’t need. Now here’s some stuff you might not need:

$ perl -le 'print "NaN" + 1' nan $ perl -le 'print "NaN" * 1' nan $ perl -le 'print log( "NaN" )' nan $ perl -le 'print sin( "NaN" )' nan

Any calculations we try to do with this value turns the rest of the results into "NaN". It won’t accidentally turn into 0, making you think that your calculation is accurate or destroying all values in multiplication.

But, it gets trickier. It’s more than just the string "NaN" that turns into this special value. Any string that starts with "NaN" also turns into “not a number”:

$ perl -le 'print "Nandor" + 1' nan

Is that it? Not quite. Perl will allow ignore a leading + or - sign as well:

$ perl -le 'print "+NaN"' nan $ perl -le 'print "-Nandor"'

The Barbeque Stove Bolt Special. Photos by Robin Adams, courtesy RM Auctions.

The rules of hot rodding have long been this: there are no rules. Perhaps no single car in hot rod history has embraced that belief better than the Barbeque Stove Bolt Special, a 1951 custom built with parts from 16 cars, two motorcycles and an airplane. Next week, this monument to ingenuity will cross the block in Phoenix as part of RM’s Arizona sale.

While it’s not uncommon to see Deuce Coupes sporting small-block Chevy engines, the Barbeque Stove Bolt Special goes much, much farther than this. In fact, it’s hard to identify the car by a single brand, or even by two brands. The frame started life under a 1927 Chevrolet, while much of the body (excluding the hand-built pickup bed) came from a 1921 Dodge touring car, except for the grille, which was pulled from a 1932 Ford. Power comes from a 1928 Chevrolet four-cylinder block, stuffed full of a 1932 Ford crankshaft, 1936 Pontiac connecting rods, a set of Jahns pistons and capped by a Harry Miller-modified 1930 Oldsmobile three-port head fitted with Buda diesel valves and Nash rocker arms. Carburetors are SUs, liberated from an unspecified Jaguar (or SS) model, while the dry-sump oiling system was engineered by the builders.

The builders, in this case, were James H. Hill and his father, Clark Hill, originally of Vallejo, California. Knowing that such radical modifications would tax the strength of the block, the Hills built up the block using 26 pounds of welding rod and six tanks of acetylene gas; to ensure even and complete cooling (and thus reduce the chances of warping), the hot, welded block was cured for four days in a charcoal bed in the family’s barbeque, and the custom’s name was born.

Following the car’s completion in 1951, it was campaigned on dry lakes in land speed record competition. The California-Nevada Timing Association clocked the Frankenrod at a speed of 84.4 MPH, which the Hills later assured Honk magazine (the predecessor to Car Craft) was due to its unfavorable 2.54:1 gearing. There’s no record of a higher top speed with reduced gearing, but the one-of-a-kind custom also proved its worth at the

Republic.

History

According to tradition, San Marino was founded about A.D. 350 and had the good luck for centuries to stay out of the many wars and feuds on the Italian peninsula. It is the oldest republic in the world. San Marino has survived, completely intact, attacks by other self-governing Italian city-states, the Napoleonic Wars, the unification of Italy, and two world wars. Those born in San Marino remain citizens and can vote no matter where they live. It joined the United Nations in 1992.

The Captains Regent, an elected pair, serves as San Marino's heads of state. The two people are elected every six months by the Grand and General Council of San Marino. Each new pair takes office the first day of every April and October. As of Oct. 1, 2015, the current two heads of state and government are Lorella Stefanelli and Nicola Renzi.

Three people died and two were injured in a shooting Wednesday morning at an Edgewood, Md., area business park, the Harford County sheriff said.

The shooting occurred around 8:58 a.m. at Advanced Granite Solutions, and sheriff’s deputies were on the scene within four minutes, according to Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler. All five people were shot with a handgun, and are employees of the business, Gahler said.

“This does appear to be a targeted attack, limited to that business,” Gahler said at an 11:10 a.m. news conference.

Gahler identified the suspect as 37-year-old Radee Labeeb Prince, who he said was connected to the business.

“What that association is, that’s still under investigation,” Gahler said.

The suspect left the scene in a black 2008 GMC Acadia with Delaware tags, the sheriff said. A residence in Cecil County was searched as part of the investigation, he said.

“We do not believe that anybody else was involved in this incident,” Gahler said.

Two patients from the shooting were in critical condition at Shock Trauma, University of Maryland Medical System officials said Wednesday morning.

A modified lockdown has been lifted from those Harford County schools in the Edgewood area that were placed under precautions earlier in the day, district officials said.

“There’s an individual out there on the loose who’s committed one of the most heinous acts in our county. We certainly consider him armed and dangerous,” Gahler said.

According to Advanced Granite Solution’s website, the company designs, manufactures and installs granite, marble and stone countertops and other surfaces in Maryland, Pennsylvania and Delaware.

Prince had several prior arrests and run-ins with law enforcement, court records show.

In December 2003, he pleaded guilty in Delaware to 15 counts of third-degree burglary and was sentenced to 25 years with all but two years suspended, court records show. He was ordered to pay $34,500 in restitution, the records show.

He was charged with several handgun counts in March 2015 in Cecil County, including being a felon in possession of a firearm and carrying a handgun in vehicle; those charges were dropped by Cecil County prosecutors about three months later.

In February, a peace order — Maryland’s equivalent of a restraining order — was taken out against him in Harford County but was denied. Details of the case were not immediately available.

Hmm, if we look at $g(x) = f(f(x)) = x^2-2$ and find the fixpoints $t_0=-1,t_1=2$ then we might assume a solution $h(x)$ for $g(x) = h(x-2)+2 $ and then from this we search for the half-iterate of $h(x)$ defining $h(x-2)+2 = w(w(x-2))+2$ and shall have a solution of the problem by $f(x)=w(x+2)-2$, hopefully having nonzero range of convergence at least in the vicinity of the fixpoint $t_1$.

With this ansatz we find that $$h(x) = g(x+2)-2 = (x+2)^2-4 = 4x+1x^2$$ could be a replacement for $g(x)$ and from this we get the leading terms for the power series of its half-iterate $$w(x) = 2 x + 1/6 x^2 - 1/90 x^3 + 1/720 x^4 - 7/32400 x^5 \\ + 161/4276800 x^6 - 391/55598400 x^7 + O(x^8) $$ by standard algebraic manipulations. (To check this insert $w(x)$ for $x$ in that leading terms)

Thus $f(x)$ can be written as a power series around (fixpoint) $2$: $$f(x) = 2+ 2 (x-2) + 1/6 (x-2)^2 - 1/90 (x-2)^3 + 1/720 (x-2)^4 - 7/32400 (x-2)^5 \\ + 161/4276800 (x-2)^6 - 391/55598400 (x-2)^7 + O(x^8) $$ (The link gives a confirmation using WolframAlpha and a $\cosh()$ /$\text{arccosh}()$-formula, see my other answer)

By the first $64$ terms it looks as if $w(x)$ has a positive range of convergence; and computing a couple of examples gives $$ \begin{array} {c|c|c|c} x &g(x)=h(1-t_1)+t_1 & f(x) = w

<|begin_of_text|>How much is 1 byte, kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte, etc.?

Below is a list of each of the accepted disk drive space values. It is important to realize that not all manufacturers and developers list their value using binary, which is base 2. For example, a manufacturer may list a product's capacity as one gigabyte (1,000,000,000 bytes, a metric value) and not 1,073,741,824 bytes (gibibyte) that it actually is. For this page, we are using the "common names" and listing all values in base 2.

Note: All values are listed as whole numbers, which means a GB shows it can only contain one 650 MB CD. Technically, 1 GB could hold 1.5753 CDs worth of data, but this document isn't meant to show you how many "parts" of an object a value can hold. Therefore, we are omitting decimal values. More plainly, you can only fit one complete 650 MB CD on a 1 GB drive since two full 650 MB discs exceed 1 GB.

Tip: Except for a bit and a nibble, all values explained below are in bytes and not bits. For example, a kilobyte (KB) is different than a kilobit (Kb). When referring to storage, bytes are used whereas data transmission speeds are measured in bits.

Bit

A bit is a value of either a 1 or 0 (on or off).

Nibble

A nibble is 4 bits.

Byte

Today, a byte is 8 bits.

1 character, e.g., "a", is one byte.

Kilobyte (KB)

A kilobyte is 1,024 bytes.

2 or 3 paragraphs of text.

Megabyte (MB)

A megabyte is 1,048,576 bytes or 1,024 kilobytes.

873 pages of plain text (1,200 characters).

pages of plain text (1,200 characters). 4 books (200 pages or 240,000 characters).

Gigabyte (GB)

A gigabyte is 1,073,741,824 (230) bytes. 1,024 megabytes, or 1,048,576 kilobytes.

<|begin_of_text|>Democrats may be spending themselves (and the country) into oblivion, but some Republicans are not doing much better. The fiscal irresponsibility is pervasive, appearing not only in the party’s national leadership, but also among state legislators. prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" / Oh, sure. Republicans have put up a good front recently, objecting strenuously to the flood of spending by Democratic lawmakers. Some of their horror is doubtless genuine. Spending during Obama/Pelosi/Reid’s (as yet short) reign has increased at unprecedented levels. The nation is facing record spending and deficits—and OPR have only just begun. But it is easy for Republicans to take a purely partisan stance against Democratic spending. If they want to regain the trust of voters, they must do more. They must demonstrate their ability (and willingness) to do better. They must not only reverse recent Democratic excesses, but they must also reverse their own recent excesses. Unfortunately, it does not seem that many in the current Republican leadership have the will to take such a stand. Consider the fact that Republican National Chairman Michael Steele has spent twice as much as his predecessors, as recently reported by Politico. It would be one thing if he were spending all that money on campaign ads and get-out-the-vote efforts. But he’s not. He’s paying for limousines, world-class caterers, private airplanes—even an annual RNC meeting in Hawaii. The exodus of Republican donors during his tenure emphasizes the recklessness of his spending—and the irresponsibility of anyone in Republican leadership who is not taking action against such lack of discipline. Why should voters trust leaders like Steele with federal tax dollars when these leaders are so thoughtless with private donations? But the problem does not stop with a few spendthrift national leaders. This fiscal irresponsibility extends even to conservative states like Texas. Naturally, the election year has prompted some Republican officials to make big, splashy, headline-grabbing displays of fiscal conservatism. Well, terrific, but these same officials also made many terrible, fiscally irresponsible decisions earlier, during non-election years. Voters are thus being asked to take a leap of faith: Trust that the conservative, election-year version of these officials remain. Hope that the big government, spendthrift version of these officials will not return after the election. In general, Texas has received much praise for being fiscally conservative, but let’s face it.

Which state has the most forest land in the US, and which have made protecting evergreen wildlife a priority? Interestingly, there’s a pretty big gap between the two! The most forested state by far is Maine at 89% forest coverage, whereas the home to the largest national park in the US is Alaska. The Last Frontier is home to seven of the 10 largest US national park areas in size, with the largest being Wrangell-St. Elias. Which state has the most trees? It’s hard to say, since all trees have different sizes, but Maine is the most likely contender, with its relatively smaller pines. Its nickname is the Pine Tree State, after all, and its forest cover may relate to the fact that it’s the least densely populated state on the East Coast. While Maine is the state with the most trees, many others low on the list, like California, have made forest protection a priority. Check out our map to see more info besides which state has the largest area under forest.

Which state has the most national parks? What is the largest national park? If you find yourself asking these questions about the national parks in the United States, check out the map below! Surprisingly the majority of the largest parks are in Alaska. This is most likely due to the fact that it was one of the last territories to become a state and its low population. How many state parks and national parks have you visited?

<|begin_of_text|>When I started being a content creator in the Crypto Space over 3 years ago, all my articles were being published on CoinTelegraph (besides this website) and I decided to do a different kind of analysis on August 31st, 2014. The Article was titled “Intro to Time” and it had one of my favorite art covers to date:

The article also featured the table above with key dates in the life-cycle of Bitcoin and while I myself did not take the Mid June 2015 date seriously, I do not plan to make the same mistake again Mid August 2017.

Background:

I have been a fan of Martin Armstrong’s work for a long time and even attended several WEC conferences over the last few years. I give him lots of credit for helping me understand Global Economics, Capital Flows and the concept of time being Cyclical and NOT linear. So just as a thought experiment, I decided to apply the most basic idea from Martin’s writing to Bitcoin. this concept that since time is cyclical we can represent the number Pi in terms of days (or years) and apply it to get some useful dates to keep an eye on in the future.

The Math:

In it’s most basic form, taking the number Pi = 3.1416 and giving it a multiplier of 1000 = 3,141.6 days. Converting this number to years by dividing it by 365.25 = 8.6012 years.

NOTE: I used 8.61 years in the original article as I divided by 365 instead

So at this point 8.6 years represents one full cycle and the most critical day for Bitcoin going forward (more on this later). We can also consider multiples of this day as slightly less significant, which is why in the 2014 article I was looking at half and quarter cycles to find dates of significance to keep an eye on (more on this later as well)

This cycle needs to be applied from some starting point. While several options were available like Publication of the Bitcoin White Paper and the first popular financial transaction giving Bitcoin a price, the most logical one seemed to be the generation of the Genesis Block on January 3rd 19:05:05 UTC Time.

NOTE: At this point I would like to thank Mark B for providing a Python script in order to remove all rounding errors when determining the date. The code will be at the bottom of the articles for those interested in running it on your own.

In fiscal year 2016, BC Hydro paid $1.229 billion to independent power producers and, in the quarter ended March 31 2016, it paid 9.8¢ a KWh, a 23% increase of the unit cost in the preceding fiscal year.

In fiscal year 2015, BC Hydro sold electricity to Alberta and Western USA for $775 million, netting an average of 3.5¢ a KWh.

In fiscal year 2016, BC Hydro sold electricity to Alberta and Western USA for $460 million, netting an average of 3.1¢ a KWh, a 14% decrease in the unit cost in the preceding fiscal year.

Had IPP’s sold their power for the same price that BC Hydro realized in trade markets, they would have realized:

In FY 2015, $591 million less ;

; In FY 2016, $782 million less.

The deals will get better for IPPs. BC Hydro’s website now announces that it has contracted for 19,290 GWh from these private producers. That is 35% more than purchases in the just completed fiscal year and follows an established trend.

The chart is prepared from annual sales reports issued by BC Hydro. This shows the total sales to the utility’s three main customers groups: residential, commercial and heavy industrial.

This entire subject is not one that BC Liberals like to discuss. I’m told they have BC Hydro working on a revised demand forecast and have had major problems trying to force square pegs into round holes. Even without Site C, it would be impossible to justify further purchases from private power producers. If BC Hydro continues dumping power on external trade markets, prices will be reduced to even lower levels.

That outcome will make expensive Site C power an even bigger financial disaster.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

The number of dimples on a golf ball varies, depending on the manufacturer and may even be different for different models made by the same manufacturer. The dimples are usually the same size as one another, but some golf balls have several different sizes of dimple on the same ball. Any number between 300 and 500 dimples is reasonable, and 336 is a common number. Not just any number will do. Golf balls are usually covered with dimples in a highly symmetrical way, and for many values of N, it is impossible to cover the golf ball uniformly without gaps. Symmetry is important or the ball will wobble or its flight will depend on which part of the ball is forwards or sideways as the ball spins. You can get an idea of how to space dimples uniformly around a sphere by thinking about the "platonic solids" -- the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron, and placing a dimple at the corners of an inscribed platonic solid. Variations on this theme give the corners of Buckminster Fuller’s geodesic domes, and also the possible symmetrical locations of dimples on a golf ball.

If you’re curious about why the dimples are there in the first place, see.

Because original Shoes is outdated and new Shoes 4 isn’t released yet, we’ll use Green Shoes in this tutorial.

How to install Shoes

Before you can install green_shoes you have to install ruby. I’ve included instructions about how to install ruby in previous post.

If you have ruby installed by rvm, just install green_shoes with rubygems:

$ gem install green_shoes

If you have trouble with installation, you have to install ruby gtk2.

Running shoes

To run we need to add green_shoes gem to our ruby file.

Go to your favorite text editor, create new file calculator.rb and type this code:

calculator.rb

require 'green_shoes' Shoes. app ( title : "My calculator", width : 200, height : 240 ) do end

Go to the terminal and run green shoes:

ruby calculator.rb

You should see something like this:

Adding basic template for app

Let’s add template for our calculator. We need to add place for number field, clear button and remaining buttons.

require 'green_shoes' Shoes. app ( title : "My calculator", width : 200, height : 240 ) do flow width : 200, height : 240 do flow width : 0. 7, height : 0. 2 do background rgb ( 0, 157, 228 ) end flow width : 0. 3, height : 0. 2 do end flow width : 1. 0, height : 0. 8 do background rgb ( 139, 206, 236 ) end end end

If you run shoes again, you should see something like this:

</img>

Let’s look at what we’ve done. First we’ve created flow, that copy size of screen.

flow width : 200, height : 240 do

Our app is divided into three parts: number field, clear button and remaining buttons, so we’ve created three different flows to match it.

flow width : 0. 7, height : 0. 2 do background rgb ( 0, 157, 228 ) end

Here we used floating points to match size of flow. If you type 0.7 it means 70% width of screen and if you type 0.2 it means 20% size. Then we’ve

's new Engel Weisse hit shelves in late July, the German-style brew will have the lowest alcohol content of any Colorado beer sold in a liquor store -- 4 percent ABV, or 3.2 percent alcohol by weight.

Continue Reading

And it would have been much lower, between 2.5 and 3.4 percent ABV, if Elevation hadn't received a couple of reminders about a controversial rule that forbids liquor stores from selling low-alcohol beers, those that weigh in at under 4 percent ABV.

See also: - Ten new Colorado craft beers to look for in July - Beer here! John Hickenlooper will sign Senate Bill 60 at 3 p.m. today at Old Chicago - Light beer ban at restaurants to be lifted?: Last chance for Colorado to see the light

"We took a deeper look into the law and talked to some of our distributors and some retail outlets...and decided to change the recipe a little bit," says Elevation spokesman Xandy Bustamante. "The difference in taste is very, very minimal."

The beer is a traditional German-style Berliner weisse, meaning it has crisp, sour notes that make it good for hot-weather drinking. Elevation aged its version in second-use whiskey barrels that have been washed so that they impart more of the oak flavors.

In Germany, these unfiltered wheat-based beers are served with sweet syrups, like raspberry and woodruff; Elevation will do the same in its Poncha Springs taproom.

"We wanted to do something sour for a long time, and we decided that we specifically wanted to make a Berliner weisse because it's an everyday sour, and one that you can have a couple of because it's low in alcohol," Bustamante says.

Originally, Elevation planned to brew the beer at 2.5 percent ABV, which would have made it around the same alcohol content as similar beers in Germany, and then it moved it up to 3.4 percent. The brewery even made a batch of Engel Weisse at that ABV -- before realizing that the alcohol content was still too low to be legally sold in liquor stores.

"We were disappointed when we had to change it," Bustamante says. "But since draft accounts and liquor stores are 100 percent of our business, we adjusted the recipe."

The change was forced by a Colorado Department of Revenue rule that received a lot of attention in 2010 and 2011 amid the ongoing

<|begin_of_text|>This beautiful instrument cannot be tuned. Image: Gryffindor, via Wikimedia Commons. CC BY-SA 3.0.

The integers are a unique factorization domain, so we can’t tune pianos. That is the saddest thing I know about the integers.

I talked to a Girl Scout troop about math earlier this month, and one of our topics was the intersection of math and music. I chose to focus on the way we perceive ratios of sound wave frequencies as intervals. We interpret frequencies that have the ratio 2:1 as octaves. (Larger frequencies sound higher.) We interpret frequencies that have the ratio 3:2 as perfect fifths. And sadly, I had to break it to the girls that these two facts mean that no piano is in tune. In other words, you can tuna fish, but you can't tune a piano.

When we tune an instrument, we would like for all our octaves and fifths to be perfect. One way to tune an instrument would be to start with a pitch and start working out the fifths above and below it it. We start with some frequency that we call C. Then 3/2 times that frequency is G, 9/4 times that frequency is D (an octave and a step above our original C), and so on. If you learned about the “circle of fifths” at some point in your musical life, then you know that if we keep going up by fifths, we’ll eventually land back on something we'd like to call C. It takes a total of 12 steps, and so if we keep all our fifths perfect, the frequency of the C we get at the end is 312/212, or 531441/4096, times the frequency of the C we had at the beginning. You might notice that 531441/4096 is not an integer, much less a power of 2, so our ears would not perceive the C at the end as being in tune with the C at the beginning. (531441/4096 is about 130, which is 2 more than a power of 2, so we would hear the C at the top as being sharp.) And it's not a problem with the assumption that it takes 12 fifths to get from C to shining C. We can never get perfect octaves from a stack of fifths because no power of 3/2 will ever give us a power of 2.

The fundamental relation between mass and weight is defined by Newton's Second Law. Newton's Second Law can be expressed as

F = m a (1) where F = force (N, lb f ) m = mass (kg, slugs) a = acceleration (m/s2, ft/s2)

Mass

Mass is a measure of the amount of material in an object, being directly related to the number and type of atoms present in the object. Mass does not change with a body's position, movement or alteration of its shape, unless material is added or removed.

an object with mass 1 kg on earth would have the same mass of 1 kg on the moon

Mass is a fundamental property of an object, a numerical measure of its inertia and a fundamental measure of the amount of matter in the object.

Weight is the gravitational force acting on a body mass. The generic expression of Newton's Second Law (1) can be transformed to express weight as a force by replacing the acceleration - a - with the acceleration of gravity - g - as

F g = m a g (2) where F g = gravitational force - or weight (N, lb f ) m = mass (kg, slugs) a g = acceleration of gravity on earth (9.81 m/s2, 32.17405 ft/s2)

Example - The Weight of a Body on Earth vs. Moon

The acceleration of gravity on the moon is approximately 1/6 of the acceleration of gravity on the earth. The weight of a body with mass 1 kg on the earth can be calculated as

F g_ earth = (1 kg) (9.81 m/s2)

= 9.81 N

The weight of the same body on the moon can be calculated as

F g_ moon = (1 kg) ((9.81 m/s2) / 6)

= 1.64 N

The handling of mass and weight depends on the systems of units used. The most common unit systems are

the International System - SI

the British Gravitational System - BG

the English Engineering System - EE

One newton is

≈ the weight of one hundred grams - 101.972 gf (g F ) or 0.101972 kgf (kg F or kilopond - kp (pondus is latin for weight))

Bucharest City Hall has a large apparatus compared to other big cities in Europe.

It has 860 employees, and 10 mayor’s personal advisers for a population of 1.88 million people on a surface of 228 square kilometers. By comparison, Berlin has 207 employees, at a population of 3.46 million on an area of 891 sq km, according to data from the National Council of Small and Medium-Sized Companies in Romania (CNIPMMR).

The council has been critical of the Bucharest City Hall’s plan to create 19 public service companies that will be controlled by the municipality.

CNIPMMR representatives explained that in other EU member states the local authorities normally set up a small number of companies in uncompetitive, subsidized areas. In Vienna, for example, there are three municipal companies, at a number of 2.26 million inhabitants on an area of 414 sq km. Madrid has seven municipal companies at a population of 3.16 million on an area of 605 sq km.

One week ago, the General Council of Bucharest City Hall approved the creation of 19 companies managed by the City Hall that will provide services in energy, public lighting, hospital administration, sports facilities, tourist attractions.

Say the network hash rate doubles in the fall, that would mean 170 days or if it triples, 255 days. They sip power so running them longer isn't an issue. I realize you would need good hubs which are ~$70US each for an aluminum 10 port USB 3 powered hub (aitech sells one through amazon for 69.99 - I believe the seller's name is computerExtension). I know these work great for 10 usb miners. Are you currently running a couple of 6770's and a couple of 7770's for bitcoin? Even if we just purchase sufficient amounts of block erupters to replace those, we would be further ahead. The usb hubs would com in handy for the next gen asics too I'm sure. They have to release a little usb key for those if us who can't afford the big rigs!!I ordered 20 block erupter blades last wednesay and had them running by Friday evening before I left for work. I paid 5.99 BTC/10 and I saw just last night the price dropped to 4.19BTC/10 (free UPS express shipping until Aug 15th on 5BTC+ orders). The miners were new and worked perfectly. I'm hesitant to mention this seller as I see BTCGuild store is 1000 units shy right now!I'm just thinking in the short term to keep up our percentage of the network share while you formulate a long term plan.Thoughts anyone?Take care

Thanks for the confidence guys, it's appreciated. I'd like to get as much feedback as possible in order to reach a consensus on the direction we should take going forward as far as future hardware purchases go. I favor Bitfury gear due to their efficiency claims and ability to demonstrate progress in their development process. On the other hand I've seen little evidence to convince me that knc will be able to deliver products on their timeline. Does anybody disagree with my take on this and if so why? Also does anybody have any other suggestions as far as which vendor they feel is a better choice and if so why? Avalon has said they were done with pre-orders and that they were developing 55nm? chips of their own for October delivery. Clearly their reputation has been tarnished, but

(C) linear-quadratic, (D) hormesis Different assumptions on the extrapolation of the cancer risk vs. radiation dose to low-dose levels, given a known risk at a high dose:supra-linearity,linearlinear-quadratic,hormesis

The linear no-threshold model (LNT) is a model used in radiation protection to quantify radiation exposure and set regulatory limits. It is most frequently used to calculate the probability of radiation induced cancer at both high doses where epidemiology studies support its application but, controversially, it likewise finds applications in calculating the effects of low doses, a dose region that is fraught with much less statistical confidence in its predictive power but that nonetheless has resulted in major personal and policy decisions in regards to public health. The model assumes that the long-term, biological damage caused by ionizing radiation (essentially the cancer risk) is directly proportional to the dose. This allows the summation by dosimeters of all radiation exposure, without taking into consideration dose levels or dose rates.[1] In other words, radiation is always considered harmful with no safety threshold, and the sum of several very small exposures are considered to have the same effect as one larger exposure (response linearity).

One of the organizations for establishing recommendations on radiation protection guidelines internationally, the UNSCEAR, recommended in 2014 policies that do not agree with the Linear No-Threshold model at exposure levels below background levels of radiation to the UN General Assembly from the Fifty-Ninth Session of the Committee. Its recommendation states that "the Scientific Committee does not recommend multiplying very low doses by large numbers of individuals to estimate numbers of radiation-induced health effects within a population exposed to incremental doses at levels equivalent to or lower than natural background levels." This is a reversal from previous recommendations by the same organization.[2]

There are three active (2016) challenges to the LNT model currently being considered by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. One was filed by Nuclear Medicine Professor Carol Marcus of UCLA, who calls the LNT model scientific "baloney".[3]

Whether the model describes the reality for small-dose exposures is disputed. It opposes two competing schools of thought: the threshold model, which assumes that very small exposures are harmless, and the radiation hormesis model, which claims that radiation at very small doses can be beneficial. Because the current data are inconclusive, scientists disagree on which model should be used. Pending any definitive answer to these questions and the precautionary principle, the model is sometimes

But don’t be fooled: It’s still one-way traffic for the server.

Even though the returner has won 40 per cent (two of five) of the points played so far in the game, his chance of breaking serve is still less than 10 per cent.

An Infosys ATP Beyond The Numbers analysis of the current Top 10 players in the Emirates ATP Rankings shows that, since the start of the 2015 season, they have held serve from 40/30 92.7 per cent (6331/6826) of the time.

The player who has been the toughest to break when leading 40/30 on serve is Roger Federer, who has held a dominant 95.4 per cent (535/561) of the time from this seemingly competitive point score.

Current Top 10: Holding from 40/30 since the start of the 2015 season

Federer: Past Three Seasons Holding From 40/30

2017 = 96.3% (157/163)

2016 = 95.5% (107/112)

2015 = 94.7% (271/286)

Even worse news for his opponents: Federer has slightly improved in this specific category during the past three seasons. This year, he's led 40/30 during 163 service games and has lost only six of those games. Opponents must feel like they are getting closer to capturing Federer’s serve, but in reality, they are farther away from breaking than they were at 0/0.

Infosys Nia Data shows that in 2017 Federer is holding serve 91 per cent of the time, but at 40/30, he is holding 96.3 per cent (157/163) of the time. The returner winning two points in the service game doesn’t trump the fact that Federer needs just one more point to hold. When the Swiss star has surged ahead 40/15 this season, his win percentage has elevated to a near-perfect 99.1 per cent (229/231).

Marin Cilic is the second best performer of current Top 10 players, holding serve from 40/30 94.6 per cent (596/630) of the time since the beginning of the 2015 season. Former World No. 1s

FOLLOWING his return to Ireland after narrowly avoiding rotting away in an Egyptian prison, Ibrahim Halawa has stated that he just wants to get back to his home with his family, catch up with his friends, eat some Tayto crisps, stick a nice pot of Barry’s tea on the boil and kick back and read all the messages of support that have been posted in the comments section of the Journal.ie over the last four years.

The now 21-year-old Halawa was released from custody earlier this month, following his arrest in 2013 and subsequent imprisonment, where he was found guilty on all counts of whatever it was he was charged with by trial of social media.

Having touched down at Dublin airport, the visibly emotional Ibrahim was unable to contain his tears long enough to speak to WWN, but we managed to get an outline of what the Dublin native intends to get up to.

“Yeah, he did a quick search for his name on Google and it returned 1,457 Journal.ie articles, each with hundreds of comments,” said a source close to the Halawa family.

“And we said Ibrahim ‘lad, you don’t need to read any of those comments’.

<|begin_of_text|>No, I don't mean like this, but rather, If you spent any time trying to figure out xkcd's Umwelt April Fool comic this year, you may be interested in the Haskell source code. They used all sorts of information about you, the browser you were using, the resolution of your screen, to the geocoding of the network address you came from, etc. to serve up a custom web comic.

Today, davean posted to github the code for waldo, the engine he wrote to drive that comic.

Alas, he was not kind enough to actually supply the code for the umwelt comic strip itself, so you'll still be left wondering if the internet managed to find all of the Easter eggs. (Are they still Easter eggs when you release something a week before Easter?) You may find the list of links below useful if you want to get a feel for the different responses it gave people.

Starting off with the 3D printers, Polaroid is launching three models to choose from, varying in size but with each of the units manageable in a home or small office environment.

“Creativity has always been at the heart of our brand,” said Scott W. Hardy, President and CEO of Polaroid. “For 80 years, we have given consumers the ability to express themselves and explore their own creativity, with the medium of instant photography top of mind. We could not be more excited to now offer another dimension with our new line of 3D printers and pens. Whether it be artwork, prototypes, jewelry, or models, we’re eagerly awaiting what our customers will create and just where their imaginations will take them.”

The 3D pens are designed to allow users to design 3D models using ABS or PLA filament and both of these models come with 10m of starter filament to get the user started. The two pens are generally similar, but differ in two major ways, with the DRW100 3D being a wired pen, while the DRW101 3D is wireless and comes with an internal battery and charging stand to accommodate that technology.

The printers have an expected MSRP between $499 and $799 and the pens have an MSRP between $129 and $149. The 3D printers are expected to be available in July, with the pens and filament hitting the market in March.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

BATON ROUGE – The Louisiana Department of Health reports that cases of mumps are popping up in Louisiana.

As of Wednesday, there have been 12 cases of mumps reported by the Office of Public Health, though officials warn that this number might change daily or multiple times a day.

“There has been a large outbreak of mumps cases in Arkansas and we’re starting to see cases in Louisiana now,” said Dr. Frank Welch, medical director of the state Immunization Program, Louisiana Department of Health.

The first cluster of cases has been identified at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. The university is taking extra precautions to prevent the spread among students and faculty.

The Louisiana Department of Health has shared health alerts and education to remind health care providers, schools and universities about the signs and symptoms of mumps.

“Our Louisiana culture is rich with festivals and celebrations including many scheduled for St. Patrick’s Day this weekend. Large gatherings create an environment where germs and contagious illnesses spread easily,” said Dr. Jimmy Guidry, State Health Officer, LDH. “This is a great time to remind everyone to take proper precautions to avoid getting sick.”

The Louisiana Department of Health offers these reminders to avoid the spread of infection:

Do not share drinks, utensils, or food.

Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.

Clean surfaces that are frequently touched (such as toys, doorknobs, tables, counters, etc.) with soap and water or with cleaning wipes regularly.

Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand cleaner.

If you have symptoms, stay at home for 5 days after symptoms begin; avoid school, work or large group settings.

Symptoms of mumps include:

Fever

Headache

Muscle aches

Tiredness

Loss of appetite

Swollen and tender salivary glands under the ears on one or both sides

Dr. Welch added that a person who has the mumps virus may not know they are ill because it can take several weeks after the infection until the symptoms occur.

“The infectious period is the time period during which an infected person can spread the disease to others. People are most infectious from one or two days before onset of symptoms until five days after they notice inflammation of their salivary glands,” Welch said.. “It is for this reason that we advise these safe sharing precautions, especially at a time when people gather in large groups.”<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

It’s disgusting, it’s duplicitous, and apparently, it’s being done in Uber cars across the United States. A number of reports have surfaced claiming that Uber drivers are planting fake vomit in their cars to collect cleaning fees from unsuspecting customers. The latest alleged victim of such a scandal is Manhattan-based art director Meredith Mandel, who says that her Uber driver placed yellow vomit around his car’s dashboard and floor mats and said that it was Mandel’s doing. This resulted in a $200 cleaning charge, one that Mandel denies she’s responsible for.

In an interview with Gothamist, Mandel laid out the entire story. In the wee hours of the morning of February 21, she, her boyfriend, and another friend left a restaurant in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, and hailed an Uber to return them to their respective Williamsburg residences. The unremarkable Uber ride ended just before 1:30 a.m., and Mandel went to bed thinking nothing more of what should have been a mundane car experience.

But when she checked her bill in the morning, she found that a $200 cleaning fee had been tacked on to her $19 fare, with no explanation as to why. When she reached out to customer service, she began piecing together the company’s justification, based largely upon the claim, “The driver let us know that there was a mess on the trip resulting in the need for a car cleaning.” One representative told her that her driver noted that she had been drunk, and another customer service email informed Mandel that “the cleaning fee goes 100 percent to your driver.”

This, Mandel said, really set the warning lights off in her head. “I was infuriated, because I realized that it actually is a scam,” she told the Gothamist. “At first I was trying to actually give them the benefit of a doubt, but I realized [it] because all of the money goes to the drivers.”

So she began to build her case against the allegations, coming to a number of conclusions. First of all, she notes, the photos of her so-called vomit show that some landed front seat of the car, which would’ve been impossible given that all three passengers were in the back. Secondly, she notes, the mess was only on parts of the car that could be easily washed. Third, “when she uploaded the photos to a metadata scraping website, no time or date was attached to the photos,” and when Gothamist did the same, they reached

<|begin_of_text|>Hi there folks. It’s been a long time since I last published a post. I have been busy. However in this post I am going to share some really informative tips and tricks which you might not have known about. So without wasting any time lets get straight to them:

Enumerate

Instead of doing:

i = 0 for item in iterable: print i, item i += 1

We can do:

for i, item in enumerate(iterable): print i, item

Enumerate can also take a second argument. Here is an example:

>>> list(enumerate('abc')) [(0, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (2, 'c')] >>> list(enumerate('abc', 1)) [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]

Dict/Set comprehensions

You might know about list comprehensions but you might not be aware of dict/set comprehensions. They are simple to use and just as effective. Here is an example:

my_dict = {i: i * i for i in xrange(100)} my_set = {i * 15 for i in xrange(100)} # There is only a difference of ':' in both

Forcing float division:

If we divide whole numbers Python gives us the result as a whole number even if the result was a float. In order to circumvent this issue we have to do something like this:

result = 1.0/2

But there is another way to solve this problem which even I wasn’t aware of. You can do:

from __future__ import division result = 1/2 # print(result) # 0.5

Voila! Now you don’t need to append.0 in order to get an accurate answer. Do note that this trick is for Python 2 only. In Python 3 there is no need to do the import as it handles this case by default.

Simple Server

Do you want to quickly and easily share files from a directory? You can simply do:

# Python2 python -m SimpleHTTPServer # Python 3 python3 -m http.server

Evaluating Python expressions

We all know about eval but do we all know about literal_eval? Perhaps not. You can do:

import ast my_list = ast.literal_eval(expr)

Instead of:

expr = "[1, 2, 3]" my_list = eval(expr)

<|begin_of_text|>In China, the pressure for young women to get married is huge. So what do you do if you are a gay woman? Ou Xiaobai, a 32-year-old living in Beijing, describes how a marriage of convenience helps her please her family and preserve her freedom.

I want to protect and be with my girlfriend for my entire life. And that's why I married a man in 2012.

At that time I was living a happy life with my girlfriend in Beijing. But I was under constant pressure from my family - who lived in Dalian - to get married.

Ironically my situation would have been easier a decade ago. Then there was less awareness of homosexuality and therefore less suspicion.

My parents kept asking me if I was seeing anyone. And the situation got worse after my father passed away, because my mother - concerned that I didn't seem to have settled down with anyone - started coming to live with me for a few months every year.

Realising there was no way that I could avoid the issue, I went to my friends for help - and that's how I got to know about "marriages of convenience".

I met my husband through a friend. He is a very nice man. Just like me and my girlfriend, he has been with his boyfriend for many years and has not come out.

'I knew I had made the right decision'

At our wedding my girlfriend was my bridesmaid, make-up artist and wedding dress consultant.

She was very happy and supportive of my decision, as was my husband's boyfriend. Despite being brought together by necessity, the four of us got on well and decided the details of the weddings together.

It gets very tricky if other family members live in the same city - a surprise visit could easily reveal the truth

After seeing how happy my family were at my wedding, I knew I had made the right decision. Only in this way can we satisfy everyone's needs - my family is happy to know that there will be someone looking after me when they die, and my husband no longer gets encouraged by his colleagues to go on dates with women.

At first my husband and I visited our families together during traditional holidays such as the Spring Festival and I would be at his side at work gatherings.

But in the last couple of years, now that our families and colleagues believe we have settled down, we rarely have to act as a real couple.

<|begin_of_text|>Solving Greater Than Sudoku using constraint logic programming

Greater Than Sudoku (Compdoku) is a variant of sudoku where no initial values are given, but there are greater-than relations inside 3×3 squares that the values must satisfy (the picture from http://avva.livejournal.com/2832977.html):

I want to show how the puzzle can be solved with constraint logic programming and ECLiPSe CLP.

Constraint logic programming is a logic programming extension that includes concepts from constraint satisfaction. This paradigm can be very handy for solving grid puzzles like Greater Than Sudoku.

ECLiPSe CLP is an open-source Prolog-based system with a good support for modeling and solving problems with constraint logic programming.

Here is a complete program to solve the puzzle using ECLiPSe (https://github.com/kit1980/grid-puzzle-solver/blob/master/greater-than-sudoku.ecl):

As we've previously covered in the Node.js v6.9.0 Release Brief, the Node.js v6 release line went into LTS this week. This is a major step for both Node.js and its users. The release brings a slew of feature additions to a Long Term Service release line.

With that, you may be wondering what some of the best features added to the newly minted v6 LTS are when compared to the Node.js v4 LTS release line. Luckily, we've compiled a list of 10 of the most useful and interesting new features below - including some highlights like the DevTools Inspector, unhandled Promise rejection warnings, and the Process Warnings API!

Last year, the Chromium team approached the Node core team and enquired whether there was any interest in re-using the DevTools debugger that was bundled with Blink as a way of interacting with Node.js. The Node.js debugger has not been well cared for over the years and even though it’s functional, JavaScript debuggers in modern browsers have advanced well beyond what Node can offer natively.

In Node.js v6.3.0, Google’s v8_inspector protocol was extracted from Blink and shipped with Node. This functionality is still considered “experimental” by the Node core team, meaning it is not yet extensively documented and may still be removed in a future version of Node without going through a deprecation cycle. However, given the popularity and power of this tool, and the this is unlikely to happen. A more likely outcome would be for the old debugger to eventually be removed and completely replaced by this new feature.

When Node.js is run with the --inspect command-line argument (with optional port number argument), a chrome-devtools:// URL is printed to the console. Entering this URL in a Chrome web browser will launch a remote debugging connection directly into the process. Add the additional --debug-brk command line argument to break on the first line of your application so you have time to work with the debugger. You can use Chrome’s DevTools to debug a Node application with similar power with which you can debug frontend JavaScript, including features such as live code editing and full asynchronous call stacks. Read Paul Irish’s post for more details on the kinds of features available right now in Node.js v6 LTS.

Source: Paul Irish's article, Debugging Node.js with Chrome DevTools

Far from being exclusive to Chrome, this new protocol is a WebSockets JSON protocol that is well documented and is already implemented in a number of clients and servers.

<|begin_of_text|>Suppose there are six friends in a pub. The first one says, ‘My glass is half empty, time for another one.’ The second one says, ‘My glass is half full, I’m OK for now.’ The third one says, ‘There’s a long line at the bar, let’s wait a moment.’ The fourth one says, ‘We’re going to wait anyway, so we might as well get up there now. Let’s order two rounds and get really wasted while we’re at it.’ The fifth one gets up and leaves, because he’s not in the mood to argue, wait, or get wasted. And the sixth downs everyone’s drinks, while they’re discussing what to do next.

The moral of the story? The pessimist always wants more, the optimist is annoyingly content, the realist is just annoying, the cynic stirs shit up, the quitter is irrelevant, and the opportunist has all the fun.

From a macroscopic view, Mitchell was everything Barbara Snyder could want in a law school dean hired during the great law-school market crash.

Shortly after arriving, he did meet-and-greets with faculty members — something previous deans had never done. He personally visited big law firms that had hired Case graduates, introducing himself and lobbying partners to give his grads a shot. He helped Case tally a record fundraising year at the law school.

Mitchell consciously cut class sizes. His first year, 190 new students enrolled. In 2012, that became 165. Last fall, 104. But fewer students didn't mean less money. The dean established strong connections to institutions in China, which brought in students who would pay the full annual tuition (currently $46,000 for J.D. students), whereas in-country candidates rarely pay full price.

He helped reverse CWRU's previously tumbling place in the U.S. News rankings. While the system is almost universally panned as arbitrary, a school's rankings can have dire consequences and significant rewards, and Mitchell knew how to game the system. One important factor: the peer assessment rankings, which might be why Mitchell penned a widely discussed Nov. 2012 New York Times op-ed entitled, "Law School is Worth the Money," in which he chastised those who argued against the lofty tuition tag for an education in a struggling industry. Journalists might have roundly panned it, but those people don't contribute to the peer assessment rankings in the U.S. News report. It worked: CWRU climbed to No. 64 last year, up four spots from 2012.

He also developed a new curriculum that will be installed this fall, and which was widely praised by the law community, emphasizing practical experience for the Case law students.

From the top down, Mitchell's rein looked to be off to auspicious beginnings. He was working long hours, traveling and putting in the effort previous deans had not, sources said. But that wasn't the full picture.

The law students who will walk across the stage of Severance Hall next week to receive their diplomas have the most colorful stories about Lawrence Mitchell. A lot of them come from the days before classes even started during their first years together.

"During orientation week that first year, the school had organized events at various bars downtown to kind of get to know everyone in the class," says a third-year law student. "There was this one at Pickwick and Fro

I cannot tell if to depart in silence,

Or bitterly to speak in your reproof,

Best fitteth my degree or your condition.

Thou art a girl as much brighter than her,

As he is a poet sublimer than me.

Check out this problem:

If that isn't big enough on your screen here, hit the twitchy link to get a bigger picture.

What they're asking kids to do is this: Rather than simply memorize the fact that seven plus seven equals fourteen, they're training kids to recognize possible shortcuts or easier paths to computation. If a kid realizes a seven is made up of 3 plus four, and remembers that three plus seven equals ten, then he can "simplify" the problem as ten plus four, which gives fourteen.

Here's the problem: The shortcut/easier path of computation is actually more complicated than just learning that seven plus seven equals fourteen.

This is Cargo Cult stuff. They did the same thing with their new innovations in Whole Word learning (reading a word at a glance), when they got rid of Phonics (sounding a word out, letter by letter), and doomed a generation to being bad readers.

Here's the Cargo Cult part:

Professional Highly-Educated Education Researchers noted that high-level early readers were usually just identifying words at a glance -- reading in a "whole word" way. While kids using Phonics read more slowly. Phonics kids were slower readers and struggled with it more.

So hey -- let's stop teaching kids this slow method of reading called Phonics and just teach them "Whole Word" reading!!! Win, win, win!!! It's easier for the students, and even easier for the teachers, as they don't have to teach the step-by-step Phonics method of reading. They can just say the word "horse" is horse and keep saying it until these stupid kids start learning that "horse" means horse.

Here's the problem: This is Cargo Cult mneliaty. Yes, the high-lanrneig, early-raednig kids are in fact using the Wlohe Wrod raenidg mhoted, just as you, reading that gibberish I just wrote, employed Whole Word reading -- looking at the first and last letters of the word and using context and years and years of experience in how the written language works, and what words are expected to come in which place in a sentence to read, fairly easily, a bunch of misspelled words as the words I intended.

But the high-learning, early-reading kids are only doing that because they started reading earlier than the other kids. All kids -- including the early readers -- go through the Phonics phase. One of my earliest recollections (maybe

Google engineer Rafa Camargo demonstrated just how easy it is to create your very own Ara phone with components of your choosing. The frame, which is known as the “endo” is set up for multiple module components that slide easily into the frame. He added a speaker, the processor, and battery live onstage, before powering the device up. The Ara phone booted quickly, running the latest version of Android.

Camargo then launched the camera app, even though he hadn’t yet installed the camera module, and the Ara phone told him that no camera was available to use. He quickly flipped over the phone and slid the camera module in while the phone was on. Immediately, the phone recognized that the camera was enabled, and Camargo took a photo of the cheering audience with the device.

This marks the first time a Project Ara phone has been demoed live taking a photo, and it proves Google’s claim that Ara is indeed a reality that will hit the streets soon. Camargo concluded, saying that the next Ara developers conference will be announced soon, at which point we will learn more about the future of Google’s first modular phone.

Based on what we saw at the conference, it seems likely that Ara will hit the streets sooner rather than later. It’s just a matter of which streets the phone reaches, and whether customers take to the idea of an infinitely upgradeable phone.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>In 8-dimensional geometry, there are 256 uniform polytopes with B 8 symmetry. There are two regular forms, the 8-orthoplex, and 8-cube with 16 and 256 vertices respectively. The 8-demicube is added with half the symmetry.

They can be visualized as symmetric orthographic projections in Coxeter planes of the B 8 Coxeter group, and other subgroups.

Graphs [ edit ]

Symmetric orthographic projections of these 256 polytopes can be made in the B 8, B 7, B 6, B 5, B 4, B 3, B 2, A 7, A 5, A 3, Coxeter planes. A k has [k+1] symmetry, and B k has [2k] symmetry.

These 256 polytopes are each shown in these 10 symmetry planes, with vertices and edges drawn, and vertices colored by the number of overlapping vertices in each projective position.

<|begin_of_text|>Netflix Inc. (NFLX) is a video streaming giant that provides more than 100 million users with syndicated as well as original TV shows and movies. Since its humble beginnings as a mail-order movie and TV show delivery service in 1997, the company has come a long way, effectively killing its biggest competitor Blockbuster Entertainment. Netflix went public on May 23, 2002, and an investment of $990 on Netflix's initial public offering, or IPO, date of May 23, 2002, would have generated over $310,000 after stock splits. that's a gain of 31,260%

Early Investment in Netflix

If you invested $990 right after Netflix's IPO, assuming you purchased each share of Netflix at its IPO price of $15, you would have 66 shares. Netflix did not continue higher; instead, it traded in a downtrend until early October 2002, where it hit a low of $4.85. But things turned around for the company and the early investors.

2004 Two-for-One Netflix Stock Split

On Feb. 11, 2004, Netflix closed at $71.96 per share. On Feb. 12, 2004, Netflix issued a two-for-one stock split, so those 66 shares would double to become 132 shares. On Feb. 12, 2005, Netflix closed at $37.30 per share. The investment of $990 would have been worth $4923.60, a return on investment, ROI, of 397%.

Thereafter, Netflix had its ups and downs but overall the stock kept climbing crossing one price milestone after another.

2015 Seven-for-One Netflix Stock Split

Nearly 11 years later, Netflix reported its quarterly earnings and shares made a new all-time high. The company was announced another stock split, this time, a seven-for-one stock split, on July 15, 2015. On July 15, 2015, your 132 shares would become 924 shares. On the date of the stock split, Netflix closed at $98.13 per share. The total position was worth $90,672.12 at the close, a 9058% increase over the initial investment amount.

1. Requirements

Basic knowledge about C programming

CUDA supported device (CUDA GPU list)

Installed CUDA SDK

Eclipse/nvidia nsight (nsight recommended)

2. Goal

The aim of this article is to get acquainted with bilinear interpolation technique and implement demo program which is going to scale given input image using nvidia CUDA SDK. The concept of interpolation is not explained here.

3. Optimus (hybrid graphics card)

What if I have CUDA compatibile device as a secondary graphics card (optimus)?

First of all (if you haven’t done it yet) install Bumblebee deamon.

It’s available on many popular distros, for instance:

# Archlinux pacman -S bumblebee # Ubuntu 12.04 sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install bumblebee virtualgl linux-headers-generic

After reboot perform:

sudo tee /proc/acpi/bbswitch < <<ON modprobe nvidia

Turned on nvidia device will shorten your baterry life 🙂 Be aware of that and plug in.

4. Bit operations in brief

Let’s consider the situation that we have ARGB pixel located in memory and we want to get out the blue channel. How to do that?

// Declare ARGB variable Uint32 color = 0xffd5b2c4;

Ok! What is that 0xff….??? This is a ARGB color written in hexadecimal form. Hmm… So how to read this?

/* Each of channels (alpha, red, green, blue) has value from 0 to 255. 1 byte is sufficeient to store the number, so on one octet (8 bits) you can write one channel. After decomposition: */ Uint8 a = 0xff; // 255 Uint8 r = 0xd5; // 213 Uint8 g = 0xb2; // 178 Uint8 b = 0xc4; // 196 /* How many bits do we need to store all four channels? 4*8 = 32 bits. Now it's perfectly clear the idea of Uint32 "color" variable. */

Let’s pull out channels from “color” variable

printf("Blue: 0x%02x", (color && 0xff)); printf("Green: 0x%02x", ((color >> 8) && 0xff)); printf("Red: 0x%

Text description provided by the architects. This narrow private house demonstrates what can be achieved on the myriad of ‘left-over’ spaces in inner cities, such as disused easements or parking lots. In this case, a 3 metre wide tiny caretaker’s cottage, adjoining a Heritage Hall has been recycled and linearly extended into a family house for parents and two children. Although challenged by its site, they set about grafting old with new elements that belie its constraints and pursuing their philosophy of making everything count.

In the three metre wide frontage to the old cottage is a new study designed through its portals and window boxes to engage the street. Where the site slightly opens up behind the cottage to an open, roofed and screened staircase atrium forms the primary social space. A small bridge is a library connecting it to kitchen and living room, and beyond to stacked bedrooms and a stair to a roof deck.

Privacy from close placed neighbours is gained by a series of iron screens whose perforations for light are the patterns of peeling paint of weatherboards on one of the neighbouring cottages. The screens slide or swing out to engage the neighbours when desired and to mediate different solar positions. They are one of an array of details rethinking the typology of the private house, no matter how small, as both sanctuary and communal participant.

The project recycles an existing small cottage as a piece of the house to which extensions in front and back are grafted in 3 metre and 5 metre wide portions respectively. The forward portion is a single level study room for architectural practice, or if later to be used by a new owner, a potential small office. The former cottage is opened up to form a conduit to the rear portion, it also comprising the dining space. As the site falls steeply to the rear, two levels of bedrooms are attached to the old cottage piece, with a staircase atrium running longitudinally beside a library which also bridges the front and rear parts of the house.

The atrium belies the narrowness of the site, the stairs being seating treads, and scale generated by volume. This space manages the climate of the subtropics with layers of perforated iron screens which alternatively project and open up to the external conditions. The mobile screens are intrinsic to an approach to private house design that facilitates sanctuary and engagement of the community as desired.
