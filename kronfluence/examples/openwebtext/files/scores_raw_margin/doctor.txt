On Sundays, churchgoers gather inside congregations that are remarkably monochromatic. Whites with whites, blacks with blacks, Latinos with Latinos, Koreans with Koreans, and so on.

This phenomenon, however, is more than discomfort with diversity. It is also a search for safety. In the historic black church, for example, worshippers can assert the dignity and worth that a white society denies them. For three hours on Sunday, the need to avoid offending whites doesn’t govern their lives.

As we are learning in Ferguson, Mo., African-Americans feel unsafe — far more than many whites have realized. Young black men, for example, flinch whenever a police car passes — a vulnerability that money, job and education can’t overcome.

Recent violence against women revealed a similar safety problem. Many women flinch whenever a man draws near and feel demeaned on a daily basis by sexist behaviors at work. Abuse stories are common.

People need safe places, and church has provided that safety to many. In church, a young black male can play drums with the choir, serve as an usher, hang out with friends and feel loved and accepted without any need to avoid eye contact with whites.

Years ago, after a horrible time in a congregation, a friend took me to a black church. He wanted me to rediscover safety inside church doors. There, among the marginalized, I was treated with dignity and respect and felt safe inside a church for the first time in years.

I have wondered why female clergy tend to hire female staff, to select female leaders and to emphasize female needs. Was this the “sisterhood” taking over? Turning the tables on patriarchy?

No, I think it’s part of providing a place where women can feel safe. Not just in charge, but actually safe: free to be themselves, not needing to please men or to fear men, free to imagine God as more than patriarch.

A similar search for safety has led gays to seek out gay-affirming congregations where they can be fully themselves. Some churches are entirely oriented to gay constituents.

Young church folks tend to avoid congregations led by the elderly, because they want to avoid the glares and heavy-handed control battles common in older churches.

Because safety matters so much, established congregations have an even larger dilemma than grappling with financial stress and declining numbers. They need to be safe places first.

In too many congregations, people fight over trivialities. They bully

<|begin_of_text|>Men angry and rejected, women sociable and mentally ill -- a current study by the MedUni Vienna demonstrates that these gender stereotypes prevail when Austrian daily newspapers report on suicide. This has far-reaching consequences.

When it comes to suicidal behaviour, there is a clear gender paradox: the ratio of men to women who actually commit suicide is three to one, but with attempted suicides it is exactly the opposite -- three women for every one man. A study by the MedUni Vienna which has recently been published in the highly journal Sex Roles demonstrates that the cultural script that bears partial responsibility for this is also found in the reports by Austrian daily newspapers.

These gender-specific differences are made visible by the formulation, the nature and frequency of reported suicide motives. Articles about suicide in women focus more on sociability, relationships with other people and motives that are anchored in the family environment. Psychiatric illnesses are also cited as a motive and are described in a stigmatizing manner. More complex language and cautious expressions are also the hallmarks of articles about female suicide. In contrast, the articles about male suicide use more words that relate to anger and rejection. This conservative role image that pervades Austria anyway is reinforced by this style of reporting.

Suicide risk could be reduced by changing the style of reporting

But that's not all. A very specific problem arises from this, which study leader Brigitte Eisenwort from the University Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine at the MedUni Vienna explains as follows: "Mental illnesses are described in a stigmatising way and are also generally under-represented, since they are barely mentioned at all in reports about suicidal men. This means that one key approach to prevention fails to register in the minds of Austrian readers. Psychiatric illnesses can be treated. The suicide risk can be reduced as a result." Journalists should therefore take care to present as correct a view as possible of suicidal tendencies and not revert to stereotypical portrayals of men and women.

Spotlight on eleven Austrian daily newspapers

507 articles containing the word'suicide' from eleven Austrian daily newspapers from between 1997 and 2005 were investigated. The study is one of the first investigations to look comprehensively at the subject of gender-specific patterns in the reporting of suicide. This ground-breaking study was set up under the leadership of Brigitte Eisenwort, together with Thomas Niederkrotenthaler and Benedikt Till (both from the Institute for Social Medicine at the MedUni Vienna's Centre for Public Health), as well as Barbara Hinter

<|begin_of_text|>It has been very strange to see the small comment my mother made about me wearing dresses with my band appearing in all sorts of Internet publications around the country (accompanied by photos of me and her that I didn't know existed). I don't know why anyone would care for my statement, as they were ready to sensationalize my dress-wearing based on a single sentence, but in case this becomes even more sensationalized, I would just like to put this out there: Is it really that strange for a guy to wear a dress?

So, so, so many people, especially musicians, have done this before me. I wear dresses on stage and to occasional fancy dress events because I do not enjoy neckties. I wear dresses to embrace femininity (adjective) but not to re-assign my gender to female (noun). I think that it is absurd to think that there is a rigidity to the identity of CIS and Heterosexual males and females -- that for a man to wear a dress or for a woman to wear pants must mean that they are LGBTQ. Of course, I don't mean to step on the toes of the trans community, because I think that they are incredibly brave, and I cannot imagine how difficult it is to be born in the wrong body -- especially in the brutal and unforgiving age of Internet bullying. I wish that gender didn't have to be assigned on public documents like driver's licenses, passports and such... that is the pressure that society puts on trans people. I was really bothered when an ex-coworker of mine forwarded one of these articles to me, because I don't deserve a discussion about my gender identity. I don't have a struggle with my gender identity. I feel more male than female. And I am mostly heterosexual (and white to boot!).

That being said, isn't it possible to distinguish between the adjectives of "feminine" and "masculine" and the nouns "female" and "male"? Is it not reasonable for a female to embrace masculinity (like female athletes) or for males to embrace femininity (like male jewelry designers)? I do not identify as LGBT, but I don't think that I am anywhere close to being the most traditionally hetero guy in town. I don't enjoy watching football very much, I really like small animals, I cook and bake a lot, I listen to Joanna Newsom, I know how to sew, I have watched the VH1 reality show Daisy of Love about six times in its entirety

<|begin_of_text|>The issue is particularly nettlesome with individuals who have transitioned from male to female because of the belief that they might still have a physical advantage until their hormone therapy — which not every transgender person chooses to have — is complete.

“When you start talking about transgender athletes, a male-to-female individual, we want to ensure that that is truly a decision that is permanent,” said Bobby Cox, the commissioner of the Indiana High School Athletic Association. “It is not a decision that, ‘I just decided today that I am going to be a girl and I am going to go play on a girls’ team’ and perhaps, disadvantage those kids that are on the team and imbalance the competition.

“And as we progress down this path,’’ he added, “and as we spend more time and energy with advocacy groups and medical professionals in this area, I think that there will be additional amendments to our policies.”

There is no reliable data on the number of transgender high school athletes. Only about 0.6 percent of the adult population identifies as transgender, according to federal data from 2016. Researchers from the Williams Institute, who conducted the study, reported that 0.56 percent of adults in Indiana reported identifying as transgender.

In Texas, 0.66 percent of adults said they identify as transgender, the fifth-highest percentage in the country (behind Hawaii, California, New Mexico and Georgia). Still, transgender children are considered an at-risk minority outside of sports. According to The New England Journal of Medicine, the rate of suicide attempts among transgender people is 40 percent, compared to 4.6 percent among those who are not transgender.

Relatively new policies are already being massaged and amended. In July, the Indiana state association voted unanimously to adjust its surgery requirement. It now no longer requires transgender students who are transitioning from female to male to have sex reassignment surgery in order to compete in the gender with which they identify. But that stipulation is still in place for someone transitioning from male to female.

The group asserts it is acting in the name of fairness, but transgender rights activists accuse members of simply not wanting transgender people to participate, out of fear that those athletes will have an unfair advantage.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Not encouraged to study science while growing up, Rathborne says she was told by her teachers that college physics classes “would be too difficult.”

She admits, however, that none of the teachers she had asked had taken physics at college, “so that might have influenced their opinions.”

“That conversation didn’t explicitly mention my gender, but I do wonder if they gave that same advice to male students that had similar abilities to me (I was in the top few percent of my high school physics class),” she says.

The Guardian reports:

The problem is these biases are often subtle. It’s these micro-inequities that do the most damage – the small, seemingly inconsequential ways in which people are excluded or discounted that, over time, erode confidence, value and worth and reinforce a culture that is not inclusive. BD: Has there been a moment in your career when you’ve been uncomfortably reminded of your gender? JR: It’s that thought in the back of your mind: am I getting this opportunity because I’m qualified, or because I’m female? Hopefully the former, but perhaps sometimes it might be the latter. I’d like to be known as a scientist, not a female scientist – maybe, if possible, a good scientist. The relevant point here is that typically we wouldn’t ever ask a man this same question when asking him about his career. BD: Have you been encouraged to modify behavior in masculine environments? JR: Astronomy is a very male-dominated field – this is evident in the office, at conferences, in committee memberships. I can’t recall ever being actively told to modify my behaviour, [but] having said that, it takes a certain resilience and personality to be comfortable and successful when you’re a minority in your field. You often need a pretty thick skin, you can’t be easily offended.

So, even though none of her teachers made any point about her being female (and who, by the way, probably had a very good idea about her academic abilities), and though she can’t recall any “active” request to change her behavior in the male-dominated arena, it’s just “that thought in the back of [her] mind …”

Not to mention, Rathborne bemoans a “non-inclusive culture” … yet wonders if she got her position merely because of her gender?

Known as “katoeys” or “ladyboys,” transgenders and transsexuals hold mainstream jobs in a variety of fields in Thailand. They are especially common in cosmetics shops or health stores, which almost always have a ladyboy shop assistant.

Working for new charter airline PC Air, transsexual flight attendants including 22-year-old Tanyarat Jirapatpakorn made their debut on a flight from Bangkok to the southern city of Surat Thani on Thursday, serving drinks and snacks and carrying out safety demonstrations.

“This is the beginning of the acceptance of transsexuals in Thailand, giving the opportunity for us to work in various fields,” said Tanyarat.

“Maybe in the future we can get any job that transsexuals never did before, such as police, soldiers or even pilots.”

PC Air, whose name comes from the initials of president Peter Chan, originally planned only to hire male and female flight attendants, but changed its mind after more than 100 transsexuals and transvestites applied as well.

Four were chosen, along with 19 female and 7 male flight attendants. The airline said qualifications for the ladyboy flight attendants were the same as for female flight attendants, with the additional provisos that they be like women in how they walked and talked, and have a feminine voice.

Chan, the airline president, said the ladyboy flight attendants actually might have a special advantage.

“They might provide better services because they understand both males and females. And they’re well trained according to the aviation standard,” he added.

The new recruits were chosen in February and have been training since in security measures, in-flight services, and make-up application.

PC Air flies domestically as well as to several Asian destinations, including Japan and South Korea.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Not too long ago we saw that the people of Toronto have no sympathy for a male rape victim. In a disgusting display the Toronto Twitterverse summarily dismissed the idea of a male rape victim by telling him he should be so lucky as to be attacked by four women, that he was lying, that he was gay or a prostitute, and that his victimisation doesn’t matter.

Cretins like Rosie DiManno came forward to say that “one man’s sexual assault is another man’s fantasy come true” and display a fundamentally flawed understanding of the very basic understanding of what rape is. Rape is forced, unwanted sexual interaction. You cannot want to be raped, because if you wanted it, it wouldn’t be rape.

The man, who decided (for what seems to be good reason considering the amount of ridicule he received) to stay anonymous, was a laughing stock to his peers, men and women who thought simply that a man can’t be raped. This reaction leaves me wondering just how many male rape victims have refused to step forward or seek police intervention or even counselling simply because they have been told time and time again that a man cannot be a rape victim, that they should have enjoyed it, or that in the stereotype of a man always wanting sex they were asking for it simply by being male.

With all of the time, energy, funding, and attention that is given to preventing rape why is it that the average Joe or Jane still can’t wrap their head around this?

Well first let’s take a quick look at the definition of rape. Until recently this was what Google returned:

Google’s victims are gender neutral; however, their aggressors are male.

A Google Image search for “how to stop rape” also brings up countless images where men who might otherwise be aggressors are told not to rape or are congratulated on stopping when told.

What is surprising is the heteronormative gender binary approach to rape as a topic. Men rape, women are raped. There is very little discussion in between for men who are raped by men, women who are raped by women, and men who are raped by women, like the victim in Toronto.

The response I’ve heard is that because the number of rapes that is reported in these scenarios is lower that it isn’t worth the time. I can think of one young man whose experience and entire existence was deemed worthless by the internet who might disagree. This notion may also be a beast that feeds itself: if no attention is given to these matters because they are reported less, when

In Portland, Oregon, parents of high school students have filed a federal lawsuit over the school district’s policy that allows a biological female student who claims to be male to use the boys’ locker room and bathroom.

The lawsuit is similar to one filed in Palatine, Illinois last year where, as the Chicago Tribune reported in October 2016, U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeffrey Gilbert ruled that high school students “do not have a constitutional right not to share restrooms or locker rooms with transgender students whose sex assigned at birth is different than theirs.”

The Portland lawsuit claims the Dallas School District’s policy to allow a 16-year-old female – Elliot Yoder – to use the boys’ facilities violates the civil rights of the majority of the students who are not gender-confused, the Associated Press observes.

The Oregon chapter of the ACLU argues the parents’ lawsuit is “senseless and cruel” and “targets transgender youth for simply existing and seeking an education.”

However, Herb Grey, the parents’ attorney, says boys who use the facilities at the school are embarrassed to get undressed in front of a biological female.

“The key to this whole thing is not just the privacy and the rights of just one student,” Grey explains. “It’s the rights of all the students and their parents and you can’t interpret federal law and state law and impose it on everyone else and say you’re accommodating everyone — because you’re not accommodating everyone.”

Yoder reportedly asked to use the boys’ facilities for changing before gym class because the gender-neutral bathroom is on another floor and other students noticed when she left to change.

Two years ago, when the Dallas school district first informed parents it would be accommodating a biological female who claimed to be male by allowing her to use the boys’ facilities, the enraged parents came together to protest at a school board meeting.

In May 2016, students at Green Mountain Union High School in Chester, Vermont also pushed back against the school’s transgender policy that was allowing a female student who claims to be male to use the boys’ facilities.

As Breitbart News reported, the students argued it is unfair to make the majority of students feel uncomfortable to satisfy the demands of a small minority.

Similarly, in September of 2015, 150 students in Missouri organized a protest against their school

My 5-year-old insists that Bilbo Baggins is a girl.

The first time she made this claim, I protested. Part of the fun of reading to your kids, after all, is in sharing the stories you loved as a child. And in the story I knew, Bilbo was a boy. A boy hobbit. (Whatever that entails.)

But my daughter was determined. She liked the story pretty well so far, but Bilbo was definitely a girl. So would I please start reading the book the right way?

I hesitated. I imagined Tolkien spinning in his grave. I imagined mean letters from his testy estate. I imagined the story getting as lost in gender distinctions as dwarves in the Mirkwood.

Then I thought: What the hell, it’s just a pronoun. My daughter wants Bilbo to be a girl, so a girl she will be.

And you know what? The switch was easy. Bilbo, it turns out, makes a terrific heroine. She’s tough, resourceful, humble, funny, and uses her wits to make off with a spectacular piece of jewelry. Perhaps most importantly, she never makes an issue of her gender—and neither does anyone else.

Despite what can seem like a profusion of heroines in kids’ books, girls are still underrepresented in children’s literature. A 2011 study of almost 6,000 children’s books published between 1900 and 2000 showed that only 31 percent had female central characters. While the disparity has declined in recent years, it persists—particularly, and interestingly, among animal characters. And many books with female protagonists take place in male-dominated worlds, peopled with male doctors and male farmers and mothers who have to ask fathers for grocery money (Richard Scarry, I’m looking at you). The imbalance is even worse in kids’ movies: Geena Davis’ Institute on Gender in Media found that for every female character in recent family films, there are three male characters. Crowd scenes, on average, are only 17 percent female.

More insidiously, children’s books with female protagonists sometimes celebrate their heroine to a fault. Isn’t it amazing that a girl did these things, they seem to say—implying that these heroines are a freakish exception to their gender,

<|begin_of_text|>Hi! Thanks for reaching out. I think it’s always useful to educate yourself on subjects you don’t know a lot about, so props to you for reading into new materials. I’ve taken screenshots of each question, so hopefully I can answer thoroughly! After a quick read through, though, it does seem like you’re confusing a portion of radical feminism with liberal feminism, so I’ll be certain to highlight those differences as we go. Okay!

1.

Firstly, radical feminism isn’t a new wave so much as a return to the values of second wave feminism, which is being championed by a new generation! Our collective goal is the liberation of women from historical and societal structures that bind them, working with an understanding that women suffer from sexism, or sex- based oppression. While we may have differing ideas on how to accomplish this goal, or the best route to take, you’ll universally see womens liberation on the forefront of our messages! Radfems agree that gender is a social class we ascribe to biology, that gender is the expectations and socializations we apply to our own innate biology! I.e. women are submissive, caring, like pink, will be mothers, will wear makeup…and men are strong, and unemotional, like blue, will be providers, will cut their hair short. Radical feminists say “we shouldn’t live in these boxes! Our biology doesn’t determine our interests, our abilities, who we love, or what we want to do with our life!” Radical feminists want a dismantling of gender roles, specifically because they are used to subjugate women.

2.

Radical feminism is for women, and liberating women, and it does so unapologetically. We understand that our feminism focuses on sex- based oppression - our sex being female. No radical feminists are trans exclusive. Trans men are as affected by female bodily autonomy (deserving access to female medical care, cervical screenings, breast exams, abortions, birth control, menstruation) as any woman. They deserve respect in the unique challenges they face in the cross section of transphobia and misogyny they face in the world. They deserve spaces free of male violence. The policies we pursue reflect that. People use the term “trans exclusive” because trans women do not play a role in our activism, as they are male-bodied and therefore do not experience sex-based oppression.

Blame the identity apostles – they led us down this path to populism | Simon Jenkins Read more

Fashion in collective abuse seeks comfort in crowds. In choosing “pale, stale males” (PSMs) for ritual contempt, identity politics has found a target that it hopes will confess its “guilt”. More recently the epithet “failed” has been added to explain the Brexit/Trump voters. These PSMs are further damned by being uneducated “left-behinders”, and therefore also dumb. They were thought so dumb it was suggested they vote again on Brexit, for having got it wrong first time.

Were someone such as I to take offence, demand redress or “protected space”, I would be bidden to shut up, get a life and not be so sensitive. I might plead, with Shylock: “Hath not a [pale, stale male] hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? If you prick us, do we not bleed?” I might turn to Kant and universalise the judgment. What if I were to follow “hideously” with black, female, Jewish, Arab, obese, disabled or Welsh? Is the representation of black footballers in the Premier League (as opposed to the Football Association) “hideously black”?

The reality is that PMSs are expected to take all this in their stride. They were, after all, the old hegemons. They dished out discrimination; now they should accept a taste of their own medicine. (Or will someone protest that this is patronising: why should PSMs refuse to take offence, as does everyone else?) This is, of course, fair enough – except two wrongs do not make a right. Besides, identity liberalism is surely more than the politics of tit-for-tat. It is a straining after a sort of equality of treatment.

A Saudi Arabian prince is accused of a having sexual relationship with a male aide, taking cocaine and threatening to kill women who refused his advances - as well as sexually assaulting a maid – Daily Mail Online has exclusively learned.

Prince Majed bin Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud – revealed by Daily Mail Online yesterday to be son of the late King Abdullah – now faces an extraordinary series of allegations in a civil case brought by three female staff members of his Los Angeles mansion.

Court documents seen by Daily Mail Online disclose how he is accused of being drunk and high at his $37 million mansion in Beverly Hills and repeatedly making unwanted sexual advances.

The documents were filed by lawyers acting for three female employees of Al Saud.

They include a claim that the royal attempted to urinate on the trio while screaming: 'I want to pee pee'.

He also threatened to kill one of the women if she refused to 'party' with him and jumped on top of another and began rubbing himself against her in a'sexual and aggressive manner'.

When asked to stop, Al Saud allegedly then yelled: 'I am a prince and I do what I want. You are nobody!'

All three of the women claim to have seen the royal having his penis'stroked' by a male aide and say they were forced to stay in the room and watch as the encounter unfolded.

Homosexuality is illegal in Saudi Arabia, and punishable by flogging, or even execution.

Another says she was made to watch while a different male aide bent over and broke wind in Al Saud's face – apparently at his request.

Felony charges against Al Saud (left) were dropped by the Los Angeles District Attorney but prosecutors can now bring misdemeanor charges against him

Al Saud rented this $37 million Beverly Hills mansion where it's alleged he threw two back-to-back parties with escorts and forced female workers to watch as a male aide pleasured him

The revelations about Prince Majed come a day after it was revealed that Los Angeles District Attorney has decided to drop felony charges against the 29-year-old due to lack of evidence.

Instead, the case has been passed to LA city attorney Mike Feur who will now decide whether to pursue misdemeanor charges – which could lead to a year in jail and a $3,000 fine should he be convicted.

But at least for female psychologists, that collaborator tends to be male, even when there are female full professors available, according to a new study. The authors say that the findings may reveal yet another barrier toward women advancing in academia.

The researchers honed in on psychology because of all the scientific fields they examined, it had the highest prevalence of high-ranking women. They surveyed 50 psychology departments at U.S. and Canadian universities. More than other scientific fields, psychology is heading for gender parity, though it’s not there yet. While the gender ratio of assistant professors is almost exactly even, with slightly more females, full-professor males still outnumbered females 2 to 1 in their data.

The researchers surveyed the psychologists’ research publications from 2008 to 2011. Because the study focused on collaborations within departments, they focused only on the 459 papers that had a full professor and one other member of the same department as co-authors. Such collaborations can make all the difference for junior faculty. If they don’t publish major papers within 6 years, they are unlikely to make tenure, which can often spell doom for their academic careers. Then they tallied how many of those collaborations happened between two full professors or across ranks—a full professor co-authoring with an assistant professor—and calculated the gender ratios. Of course, even if collaboration is completely gender-blind, those gender ratios would not be equally split between male-male and male-female pairs, because there are twice as many male full professors and the rate of publication varies between departments. So the team calculated what the expected gender ratios would be if the psychologists in their study were just randomly collaborating with members of their own departments. If the published papers match those expected ratios, then that would indicate that gender does not play a large role in the collaborations of psychologists within their departments.

That’s not what the researchers found. In a 4-year period, female full professors co-authored only 14 papers with female junior faculty members in their departments, half as many as expected, the team reports online today in Current Biology. Female full professors did collaborate as much as expected with female peers in their departments, as well as male junior faculty.

Female academics face several challenges that their male colleagues don’t, says lead author Joyce Benenson, a psychologist at Emmanuel College in Boston (who co-authored the paper with Richard Wrang

It was so clear that gender-related bias was one of the things this film was going to examine and challenge. After all, with Nick the fox saying “You bunnies. Always so emotional,” that had to be on purpose, right? Apparently not.

In a recent interview with io9 the director of Zootopia, Byron Howard, tells the story of how originally, the main character of this film wasn’t supposed to be Judy Hopps, the police officer bunny, but Nick the con artist fox. Back in November 2014, after years of production, the team behind the film realized that the story didn’t make sense with Nick as the lead, even though that was the version of the story that was in the original pitch and the original script. Howard explains:

We’re telling a story about bias, and when you have the Nick character starting the movie, through his eyes the city was already broken. He didn’t like Zootopia. We asked ‘What are we saying with the movie?’ If we’re telling this movie about bias—something that is everywhere and in all of us, whether we want to admit it or not—the character that’s going to help us tell that message is Judy, an innocent, [who comes] from a very supportive environment where she thinks everyone is beautiful, everyone gets along. Then let Nick, this character who knows the truth about the world, bop up against her and they start to educate each other. When we flipped that, it was a major flip, but it worked so much better.

That does, indeed, make a lot of sense. What’s interesting to me, though, is that nowhere in this rationale does it say “In this movie about bias, the character that’s going to help us tell that message is Judy, a female character who constantly faces bias herself.” Gender is mentioned nowhere in this interview. It’s so strange to me that making the female character the lead of a movie about biases wasn’t the original, obvious choice! What’s more, even after giving it thought, it seems like the fact that the character is female wasn’t the obvious thing that made them decide “you know what? She would be a

<|begin_of_text|>WASHINGTON D.C. -- For the first time an enlisted female sailor has earned her submarine qualification, U.S. naval officials said, as she joined the growing number of women who are in the Navy's "silent service."

Chief Petty Officer Dominique Saavedra received her silver dolphin pin in a ceremony Tuesday at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington. She will be deploying on a nuclear-powered guided missile submarine, the USS Michigan.

The first female enlisted sailors began training for submarine duty about a year ago. In addition to Saavedra, there are about three dozen other enlisted women assigned to submarines, working to get their qualifications. To become qualified, Saavedra, who is a cook, had to show proficiency and knowledge about all aspects of submarine systems.

First female Army Rangers graduate

"I couldn't be more proud to wear the 'dolphins,'" said Saavedra, in a prepared statement. "To have earned the respect of my fellow submariners is more rewarding than expected."

She earned her qualifications aboard the USS Ohio because the USS Michigan has been in port for maintenance, including modifications to living quarters in order to accommodate female chief petty officers and enlisted crew members. It is expected to set sail for the first time with female crew later this year.

The Navy ended a ban on women serving aboard submarines in 2010 and began integrating crews by first introducing female officers, who already have been assigned to ballistic-missile and fast-attack submarines. The ballistic-missile submarines make up the sea-based leg of the U.S. nuclear triad. The other two segments are the bomber aircraft and the land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles.

There are about 115 female officers training to become submariners, and so far, 43 female officers have earned their dolphin qualifications.

According to the Navy, the goal is to have enlisted women will make up about 20 percent - or roughly 29 - of each Ohio-class submarine crew.

Applications for the next round of training for enlisted women will begin in October, and those selected would serve aboard the USS Ohio.

A survey sent to more than 50,000 enlisted female sailors early last year found there was significant but not overwhelming interest in submarine duty. Of the 12,700 sailors who participated, 28.5 percent indicated they would be open to volunteering for submarine service.

The Navy has been at the forefront of the Pentagon's move to open all military jobs to women. After several years of study and planning, Defense Secretary Ash Carter formally declared all combat jobs -

But what do America’s college students have? Where can they turn when they find themselves outside campus “safe spaces” and suffering a “microaggression”?

Fortunately, the University of Arizona has an answer. It recently distributed a 20-page booklet suggesting to faculty that when a student is victimized by a microaggression the appropriate response should be saying “ouch.” And the correct response for the offender should be saying “oops,” according to the guide.

THE WEEK IN PICTURES

“If a student feels hurt or offended by another student’s comment, the hurt student can say ‘ouch.’ In acknowledgement, the student who made the hurtful comment says “oops.” If necessary, there can be further dialogue about this exchange.”

The guide was authored by Jesus Treviño, vice provost of the big taxpayer-funded university, whose salary reportedly is $214,000 per year.

For those unfamiliar with the apparently epidemic scale of microaggression and thus not able to spot such offenses, the booklet offers a definition: Microaggressions are “the everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to target persons based solely upon their marginalized group membership.”

The University of Arizona isn’t the first to suggest the “ouch”/”oops” protocol. Iowa State University, among others, has also urged a similar approach.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

The National Women in Law Enforcement Association will represent a growing group of women officers alleging discrimination and harassment on the job — and who believe there is little recourse, according to organizers.

Const. Angelina Rivers says women in the field of policing are "in distress right now." ( Michelle Siu for The Waterloo Record )

“Women in policing, they’re in distress right now,” says Waterloo police Const. Angelina Rivers, who is part of a proposed class-action lawsuit against the Waterloo police board and its union alleging gender-based bullying, misconduct and more. “Women are leaving policing in droves, and there’s a reason for that,” she says. Recent research examining the experience of female officers in Canada has raised concerns about the persistence of an “old boys” club’ within policing, even as more women sign onto the force.

In her study of female police officers in Ontario, Lesley Bikos, a former London, Ont. officer now pursuing her PhD studying police culture at Western University, found officers regularly subjected to verbal harassment — including being called “badge bunny” or a “tomboy” — and having to withstand hearing sexist jokes. Women officers also had to work harder to earn the respect automatically granted to their male counterparts and hesitated calling for backup out of fear of being called weak, Bikos found. Officers who become mothers, meanwhile, face another set of challenges, including being passed over for promotions because of a perception they won’t be as dedicated, according to research out of Wilfrid Laurier University. The new women’s policing advocacy group seeks to be both a support network for female police officers and group lobbying for change at the municipal, provincial and federal levels, according to its founders. Rivers said the group was born out of the realization that the ongoing proposed lawsuit against Waterloo police will take years to work its way through the courts. That’s time female officers be facing discrimination do not have, she said. The proposed lawsuit, which is seeking more than $165 million on behalf of past and present female Waterloo police officers, alleges a sexist workplace culture that subjects some female staff to verbal, physical and sexual harassment.

None of the allegations have been tested in court. The Waterloo Police Services Board has said it would challenge the suit, calling it “inappropriate” and saying filing

<|begin_of_text|>Men and women make moral decisions differently, according to new research published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin — but not necessarily in the ways scientists thought before.

The study, a meta-analysis of 40 studies with 6,100 total participants, revealed a more nuanced distinction between two common schools of moral thought.

Deontology vs. Utilitarianism

“Consider…a dilemma where you are hiding with other townsfolk from murderous soldiers,” says Rebecca Friesdorf, the corresponding author. “Suddenly a baby starts to cry—unless you smother it, the soldiers will find and kill everyone. Should you smother the baby to prevent the soldiers from killing the townsfolk?”

According to deontology, killing the baby would be wrong because murder is wrong, despite the potential consequences. Deontology puts moral norms at top priority.

According to utilitarianism, killing the baby is acceptable because it will save many lives in the end. Utilitarianism considers the overall consequences more important.

Deontology has long been associated with emotional responses to moral dilemmas, while utilitarianism is associated with cognitive, or mental, responses. Previous research has claimed that the two are opposites, and that women make more deontological decisions while men make more utilitarian decisions. However, the current study suggests it’s not so simple.

The Study

The research team, comprised of scientists from three universities in three different countries, believes that deontology and utilitarianism are not necessarily opposites—either thought process could be affected by a number of factors. In order to examine them independently, the team used a method called Process Dissociation (PD) to separate the variables. PD has been used previously to separate other controversial variables, such as racial bias in weapon identification.

“To…distinguish whether men are more utilitarian than women, or women are more deontological than men, it is necessary to measure [these]inclinations independently,” said Friesdorf.

The Results

The findings from the study challenge the traditional theory that men prefer cognitive decisions and women prefer emotional ones. After separating the variables, researchers discovered that men and women use cognitive reasoning about equally. However, women were much more likely to use emotional reasoning than men when one factor is involved: harm.

When asked a moral dilemma question that did not involve harm, women and men both tended to use utilitarian (or cognitive) thinking. However, when asked a moral dilemma question involving harm, women were significantly more likely to use deontological (emotional) thinking than men.

<|begin_of_text|>Over the past few years, a significant problem within games has become much more apparent: there is a lack of playable female characters. This new Feminist Frequency video gets a little more specific than that, asking why there are hardly any female combatants in video games.

The video begins with the notorious example of Ubisoft’s gaffe regarding why there were no playable female characters in Assassin’s Creed: Unity‘s cooperative mode. Many of the excuses could be summed up in a now-infamous phrase: “women are too hard to animate.” At the end of the day, it felt like what Ubisoft was really saying was that they just didn’t care to add female characters. While they’ve since changed their tune (see: Assassin’s Creed: Syndicate), there’s still something left to be desired elsewhere throughout gaming.

From there, the video enters into some more interesting territory in trying to understand why there are no non-sexualized female combatants. They correctly point out that when female enemies are included in a video game, the player is encouraged to engage in sexual or gender-based violence against these characters. As well, they’re all often placed into some incredibly titillating, often demeaning costumes that emphasize their sexuality over anything else (see: Saints Row: The Third‘s “Whored Mode,” and Hitman: Absolution).

In addition to this, the video makes a strong case as to why including more non-sexualized female combatants doesn’t necessarily promote violence against women. Put simply: when female enemies are presented as equals to the player and as active participants in whatever action is going on, then it doesn’t exactly count as violence against women—at least, not in the way that we all talk about in video games.

If you haven’t checked it out already, the video is well worth a watch in that it does a great job of recapping some of the more major controversies regarding female combatants and female playable characters while breaking down and analyzing some of the more recent trends we’ve seen.

“This is an age grouper who is out to have fun, God bless him,” Korff said. “And I don’t think anybody is getting an inherent advantage going from a woman to a man.”

The question of performance gains because of gender change has hindered transgender female athletes for decades. The United States Tennis Association barred the transgender tennis player Renée Richards from playing as a woman in the 1976 United States Open. The golfer Lana Lawless, who had gender reassignment surgery in 2005, sued the L.P.G.A. in 2010, claiming that the league’s “female at birth” rule violated California civil rights law. Michelle Dumaresq, a former Canadian downhill mountain biking champion, eventually left her sport after other Canadian racers protested her involvement.

Transgender male athletes like Mosier have not experienced the same legal hurdles. In 2010, the N.C.A.A. cleared Kye Allums, who identifies as male but was born female, to play for the George Washington University women’s basketball team, provided Allums did not undergo testosterone treatment.

That does not mean female-to-male athletes have an easy life in sports. Helen Carroll, sports project director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said transgender males often face harsher social pushback than transgender females.

“Oddly enough, the worst behavior in terms of teasing, taunting and threats is against female-to-male athletes,” Carroll said. “There is the belief that even with testosterone, a woman can’t be as competitive as a man.”

Mosier says he still experiences intimidation because of his gender on a regular basis, and he declined to name his place of employment or his hometown for fear of reprisal. But the tension he faces as a transgender athlete, Mosier said, is less than it was when he was a female athlete who identified as male.

“It is difficult to see old photos of myself, or to think about past memories, because there were some really unhappy moments during those times,” Mosier said.

<|begin_of_text|>Female college students are more likely to abandon studies in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines than their male classmates, and new research from the University of Washington suggests that those male peers may play a key role in undermining their confidence.

Published this week in the journal PLOS ONE, the study* found that males enrolled in undergraduate biology classes consistently ranked their male classmates as more knowledgeable about course content, even over better-performing female students.

The over-ranking equated to males ranking their male peers smarter by three-quarters of a GPA point* than their equally-performing female classmates, showing what researchers say amounts to a clear and consistent gender bias. Female students, on the other hand, repeatedly showed no significant bias in whom they picked as knowledgeable.

"This shows that there is a huge inequity in who male students think is strong in the class materials," said lead author Dan Grunspan, a doctoral candidate in the UW Department of Anthropology.

"Males were consistently nominated as being more knowledgeable by their male peers, regardless of performance."

The study involved surveying around 1,700 UW students enrolled in the same undergraduate biology course. Students in three classes were asked to name the classmates they considered strongest in their understanding of class materials at multiple points in the course. Additionally, instructors were surveyed on which students were most outspoken in class -- an effort to determine which students would be most visible to other students as knowledgeable, given the large class size. More males than females were considered outspoken by the instructors, the researchers found.

Even after accounting for differences in performance and outspokenness, male students got more recognition from other males than their female peers did, and the finding was consistent across 11 different class surveys. For an outspoken female student to be nominated by males at the same level as a male student, her performance would need to be more than three-quarters of a GPA point* higher than the males.

"Using UW's standard grade scale, that's like believing a male with a B and a female with an A* have the same ability," said co-lead author Sarah Eddy, who participated in the research as a UW postdoctoral biology researcher and is now a research scientist at the University of Texas, Austin.

On the other hand, females nominated their male and female peers almost equitably across all the surveys, after controlling for differences in performance and outspokenness. The researchers determined that the female bias was so small it could have arisen by chance, and they estimate that gender bias among male students was 19 times stronger than among

<|begin_of_text|>Fundamentals of Graduate School Tipping Below are the answers to three fundamental questions every new graduate student needs to know. Who to Tip? The answer to the "who" question becomes obvious when we consider that tipping is meant to reward good service. Those who service1 graduate students are (listed in increasing order of importance) their professors, their advisory committees, and the thesis clerk. How Much to Tip? Some universities still encourage a graduated tipping scale, "tipped" in favor of full professors. This arcane structure should not be followed. Instead, plan to tip each of your professors, regardless of academic rank, the customary 15% of the course registration fee (10% at MIT and Stanford). Of course, there will be exceptions to this guideline, so don't be afraid to increase or decrease the tip as the situation warrants. However, before "stiffing" a professor, bear in mind that your professor is obliged to share a percentage of his or her tip with those who render service but don't actually come in contact with the student, e.g., Department Chairs, Deans, Assistant Deans, Academic Deans, Graduate School Deans, etc. It is customary to tip all the members of your Thesis Advisory Committee. A good rule of thumb is to tip the committee chair the equivalent of two months salary2 (De Beers 1980). Other committee members should receive about half that amount. Not surprisingly, this guideline has contributed to streamlined committees comprised of the minimum number of members. Finally, plan to tip the thesis clerk generously. If the clerk is female, it is difficult to provide precise guidelines without knowing which coven she belongs to, but a good estimate is two dollars for each page in the main body of the thesis or dissertation. Male thesis clerks generally receive about 60-70% of what female clerks get for the same work. On rare occasions dating the thesis clerk has proven nearly as effective as a generous tip, but this is considered risky, at best.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>At San Diego Comic-Con over the weekend, Captain Marvel co-writer Nicole Perlman sat down with Wired to talk about her and Meg LeFauve’s preparation for the 2018 movie:

We’ve been talking a lot about archetypes and what we want this movie to be about and just how to write a strong female superhero without making it Superman with boobs. Meg and I are doing a lot of brainstorming and we’ll catch ourselves and say, ‘Wait a minute, what are we saying [here] about women in power?’ Then we have to say, ‘Why are we getting so hung up on that? We should just tell the best story and build the best character.’

Perlman, who became the first female writer for a Marvel Studios movie ever when she co-wrote Guardians of the Galaxy with James Gunn, says Captain Marvel is proving a little more complicated to write than the universe’s favorite gang of A-holes:

We have this constant back-and-forth about how to tell a story that is compelling, entertaining, moving, kick-ass, and fun, and also be aware of what those larger implications might be. It’s a lot more complicated than just writing [Guardians of the Galaxy].

Hollywood affords women (both female creators and female characters) fewer opportunities or second chances than it does men, so it makes sense that Perlam and LeFauve would be acutely aware of the pressure placed on Captain Marvel to succeed. Given the lack of female superhero movies overall, Captain Marvel may be expected to both positively represent all women and prove to Marvel that lady-led movies are bankable, but it’s not Perlman and LeFauve’s fault that female fans are so incredibly underserved.

In other words, it’s reassuring to see that the pair are considering the context in which Captain Marvel is being made, but that they’re realistic about the movie’s limitations as well.

Thoughts, gang?

The ladies were candid. Alexandra Wilkis Wilson, co-founder of Gilt and GLAMSQUAD, admitted it is harder; the panelists — including Jessica Alba of Honest Company and Susan Feldman of One Kings Lane — agreed.

It’s no secret that the tech industry is very much a man’s world. Recent U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission figures show 80 percent of executives in high-tech are male, and just 20 percent are female. In the Bay Area in 2015, just 8 percent of Series A startup funding went to female-led businesses, down from 30 percent in 2014.

While the biggest names in tech strive to close the gender gap and build more inclusive working environments, the pool of talent on offer is predominantly male. The truth is, while retention is an issue, there are simply fewer women opting for a career in tech.

But new initiatives and an uptick of Gen Z girls opting for sciences in top-tier universities paints a very different future. What are these young women doing that previous generations have not? And what does this all mean for Silicon Valley’s boys’ club?

What’s holding back females in tech

According to Ariane Hegewisch, a study director for the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, females make the decision to steer clear of sciences at a young age. CNET reported at Indiana University, 97 percent of new female students opt for subjects outside of science and computing. “It doesn’t occur to them as a career path,” said Maureen Bliggers, assistant dean for diversity and education at Indiana’s School of Informatics.

The proportion of female students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) university courses has traditionally been very low, and, according to the National Student Clearinghouse, it is getting worse. 2014 figures show just 18 percent of computer science bachelor degrees and 19 percent of engineering degrees held by women. In subjects such as biology and social sciences, we start to see the tables turn, with a larger proportion of females.

While the number of women in sciences is growing, they are still vastly outnumbered by males. Statistics suggest that this dwindling ratio of women in tech may be a case of nurture over nature.

The Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis meaning ‘fast walking camel leopard) is an African even-toed ungulate mammal, the tallest of all land-living animal species.

The giraffe is related to deer and cattle, however, it is placed in a separate family, the Giraffidae, consisting only of the giraffe and its closest relative, the okapi.

The giraffes range extends from Chad to South Africa. Although the Okapi is much shorter than the giraffe, it also has a long neck and eats leaves and both animals have long tongues and skin-covered horns. The giraffes ancestors first appeared in central Asia about 15 million years ago, however, the earliest fossil records of the giraffe itself, from Israel and Africa, date back about 1.5 million years.

Male giraffes are called ‘Bulls’, female giraffes are called ‘Cows’ and baby giraffes are called ‘Calves’.

Giraffe Characteristics

The giraffe is the tallest living animal which is instantly recognizable by its exceptionally long neck. Adult males stand 15 – 19 feet (4.6 – 6.0 metres) tall, whereas females are shorter at 13 – 16 feet (4 – 4.8 metres) tall. Adult males weigh between 1,764 – 4,255 pounds (800 – 930 kilograms), while females weigh only 1,213 – 2,601 pounds (550 – 1,180 kilograms). The giraffe has the longest tail of any land mammal. Their tail can grow to be 8 feet (2.4 metres) long, including the tuft on the end.

In addition to its great height, the giraffe is also one of the heaviest land animals. Exceptionally large males may weigh up to 1,900 kilograms (about 4,200 pounds). Female giraffes are smaller, rarely reaching half that weight. Compared to other hoofed mammals the giraffe has a relatively short body, however, its legs are disproportionately long.

A giraffes front legs are about 10% longer than their hind legs, a feature that contributes to the animals steeply sloping back. Mature giraffes have large hooves about the size of dinner plates, around 12 inches wide.

Giraffe Habitat

Giraffes can inhabit savannas, grasslands or open woodlands. Giraffes prefer areas enriched with acacia growth (a

Alicia Silverstone -- who's no stranger to playing a female superhero after her turn as Batgirl in 1997's critically-panned Batman & Robin-- recently sat down for an interview with Variety, where she downplayed the impact that Wonder Woman, and star Gal Gadot, have had on feminism in mainstream Hollywood.

"Before Wonder Woman… there have been many movies with female leads. So I get a little confused [about the conversation]," Silverstone shared. "I think about, ‘But what about all those wonderful comedians who are females who have had massive hits?'"

"I don’t know. I just feel like, over the years, there was Mean Girls, there was Clueless, over time we have had so many movies that have been female-driven," she continued.

Silverstone, who starred in the 1995 teen comedy Clueless, is getting ready for the 2018 debut of her new Paramount Network series, American Woman, in which she plays a single mother in the 1970s -- milestone years for the progression of feminist political efforts.

However, Silverstone said that it seems like themes of female empowerment are often only accepted when they come in the form of big blockbuster epics.

"It has to be Wonder Woman. It has to have tons of flash, right?" she said, adding, "Sometimes it's the quieter, more interesting things that sometimes [make a difference] because they touch someone enough."

Ros Phillips sent a press release yesterday claiming the recent change to same-sex marriage laws in the ACT would confuse tradies including plumbers, electricians and carpenters.

The release included a diagram depicting appliances and plumbing equipment being joined together - like male and female sex organs.

"As any tradie can tell you, marriage has always been a joining of two opposites. You cannot properly unite two of the same," Mrs Phillips said.

"By definition, marriage is a complementary, male-female union. Only that union has the potential to create and raise children with both male and female role models.

"It is not 'equality' to disregard reality. A same-sex couple will always be different from an opposite sex couple.

"Let's not confuse apprentice electricians, plumbers and carpenters in the ACT - lest the lights go out, the drains leak and the chairs collapse in the Legislative Assembly!"

Today, Ms Phillips told news.com.au the release was a "lighthearted way of pointing out the reality that marriage was always between a male and female".

"That's the only reason governments have any interest in registering marriages, because of their potential to create and raise the next generation."

ACT marriage law is a nonsense: ask any tradie #actpol... http://t.co/9bh2XZWsfJ — SaveMarriageACT (@SaveMarriageACT) October 23, 2013

She also criticised the gay community for changing its stance in the last two decades on the issue of gay marriage.

"Just a couple of decades ago, the homosexual lobby wasn't interested in marriage, they said 'why would we be interested in such an archaic tradition?'

"Now they've changed and decided it's suddenly a good thing. Underneath it all they don't want marriage, they want to change it."

She scoffed at the idea the press release could be seen by some as offensive.

"Since most people have taken it as a lighthearted press release, no I don't think it could be seen as offensive.

"It's true, electricians and plumbers use male and female parts to make joints, it's been around for a very long time."

TALLAHASSEE, Fla., Aug. 16 (UPI) -- The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against the Florida Department of Corrections, accusing a state men's prison of refusing to provide medical treatment to a transgender woman.

Reiyn Keohane, 22, has been living as a female since she was 14 years old and began hormone therapy at the age of 19, the ACLU of Florida said in a statement. While facing an attempted murder charge in 2013, Keohane was refused the ability to continue her hormone therapy by the Lee County Jail, the ACLU writes.

"Keohane accepted a plea deal for the charge in 2014 with the understanding that she would be allowed to return to her hormone therapy after being transferred to DOC custody. However, she has been repeatedly denied this treatment since her transfer," the ACLU said.

The ACLU said Keohane told DOC officials she needed to continue her treatment for gender dysphoria -- the treatment being both hormone therapy and the ability to groom and attire herself as female.

"She has had female clothing items confiscated. She has filed numerous grievances to restore her treatment, but has been repeatedly denied," the ACLU writes.

Keohane wrote a guest blog post for the ACLU in which she describes her past years under the care of the Florida prison system.

"In the years I have been incarcerated, I have been made to endure more cruelty by the State of Florida than I ever imagined the government could commit. I am a transgender woman -- but to the classification officers there is no such thing," Keohane writes. "I have been forced to strip with men, and been slapped and hit for telling the officers in charge of the search that the rules say I must be searched separately. I have been handcuffed, thrown to the ground, and held down so officers could shave my head. I have been called a punk, a sissy, and a [explicit]; I have been beaten while handcuffed for asking to see mental health professionals."

Attorneys for Sylvia Mathes, one of more than a dozen elderly women who were allegedly assaulted by a fellow resident, now claim an unidentified attorney for the Motion Picture Television Fund, which runs the skilled-nursing facility in Woodland Hills, CA, lied to them and tried to cover up the cover-up by claiming a key witness could not give her deposition earlier this month because she had pneumonia, when in fact she was ready and willing to be deposed.

As previously reported, the MPTF was accused of a “cover up” of numerous sexual assaults of female residents at its famed Alzheimer’s unit, known as Harry’s Haven.

Separate lawsuits filed by Mathes, the mother of writer-producer Gerald Sanoff, and retired costumer Nancy Renard, claim that they and 11 other female residents were sexually assaulted by Rafael Palacios, a former longtime employee of the Fund before becoming an Alzheimer’s patient there.

Palacios is named as a defendant in both suits, which note that “his dementia was becoming so severe that he simply lacked the mental ability and capacity to control his actions.”

Those complaints allege that the Fund has “long known, and covered up, that they freely allowed a sexual predator to roam their halls endangering residents” and, as a result of their “conspiracy of silence,” failed to protect the residents and allowed Palacios to “physically abuse and sexually assault” them.

In her suit, filed in August, Mathes claims she was “physically assaulted” by Palacios in July and that managers there had not taken adequate precautions to protect her from him, even though the police had been called on at least two previous occasions. Her suit states that in April, Palacios “was found on top of a female resident and the police were called” and that they were called again in May when he “was found on top of another female resident.” The suit alleges he was found on top of another female resident on June 16 and that, a few days later, he was “found on top of another female resident ‘humping.’ ”

But in an amended complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court (read it here), attorneys for Mathes now claim a key witness to the alleged assaults and cover-up was kept from giving her deposition in the case through false pretenses.

In this article, the experts at Honest Marijuana will examine the seven key stages of the marijuana plant life cycle. Along the way, we’ll discuss:

The importance of labeling the sex of your seeds

How to encourage germination

How to recognize embryonic leaves on a marijuana plant seedling

The importance of light during the vegetative stage

The difference between the male and female plants

Why you need to isolate the female plants if you want to produce the most bud

The best ways to harvest and preserve your marijuana plant

Planning for the next growing season

After that, we’ll guide you through the entire growth process of the marijuana plant—from germination to seedling; through vegetation, pre-flowering, and flowering; to harvesting and the next seed life-cycle stages of your pot plant.

So strap yourself in for a wild ride through the basic biology of your favorite weed. It’s sure to be an enjoyable trip. We’ll start our journey where all good journeys begin: at the origin, the source, the seed.

Stage #1: The Marijuana Plant Seed

Source: Pinterest.com

Pick up any seed and examine it closely. Turn it over and around. Feel the weight. Notice the shape and the color. Now tell me if that seed is going to produce a male marijuana plant or a female marijuana plant. Can’t do it, can you? Don’t feel bad. No one can.

But that introduces a major problem into the world of do-it-yourself ganja growing: how can you be sure the seeds you plant will produce the marijuana you want? This is an important question because only the female plant produces the trichome-rich cola buds that you can harvest to smoke, vape, dab and ingest.

The male plant produces none of that. In fact, the male marijuana plant can actually be a detriment to your cannabis harvest if grown together with female plants. This is because the male plant’s sole purpose is to pollinate the female plants. And while that doesn’t sound like a bad thing, it actually is.

When female marijuana plants are pollinated, they start using their energy to produce seeds and stop using their energy to feed the buds that we all know and love. Allowing a male plant to grow alongside a female plant is a recipe for reduced bud harvest

Not the games themselves, really—there were plenty of fine games released last year. No, it was a bad year for the culture of video games. Last year was, of course, the year of Gamergate. The year when everybody got to see the worst parts of that vast swath of people who call themselves “gamers.” The ones who ruined that word for the rest of us. The “movement’s” rampant misogyny hit the mainstream and hit it hard.Gamergate is still around. The petulant children who threatened female video game developers and personalities for daring to, um, have an opinion are still there. But no one is talking about them. No one cares about them.And it seems that maybe, just maybe, we’re starting to learn from them.There have been more than a few instances where women lamented the lack of female protagonists in video games. The response was invariably something to the effect of, “If you don’t like it, go make your own games,” with some slurs and/or threats thrown in for good measure. And though there are dozens of things wrong with that line of thinking, the most practically obvious is the fact that the games they were asking about weren’t the sort of titles that a few people can just get together and make. They wanted (and want) games with $50+ million budgets that star interesting female characters. And let’s not pretend like this only goes one way. I want that too. I’m sick of playing as muscly men. I think the vast majority of us are.

And though this year’s Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) underwhelmed, there was a glimmer of light that maybe, just maybe, people working in the industry are too.

LONDON: A new study has shown that the number of British people converting to Islam has almost doubled since 2001.

The study, titled “A Minority Within a Minority” and carried out by the inter-faith think-tank Faith Matters, estimates that the number of converts to Islam may have risen from about 60,000 in 2001 to up to 100,000 today. Some 5,200 people are embracing Islam each year in the UK, according to the study’s author Kevin Brice of Swansea University.

“We must stress that this is an estimate and this figure is reached based on a survey of mosques and the 2001 census figures for England and Wales and Scotland,” says Fiyaz Mughal, founder and director of Faith Matters.

This is despite the generally negative portrayal of Islam and of converts in the media. “Converts to Islam are unfortunately viewed predominantly through the lens of fear and are regarded as being connected to extremism,” says Mughal.

The study found that media representations of converts to Islam were either linked to terrorism or fundamentalism.

So why are people choosing Islam despite its vilification in the media? “I think people are more inquisitive now and want to find out more,” explains Mughal. “There is also much more contact with Muslims in urban areas.”

Peter Sanders is a well respected photographer who converted to Islam in 1971.“People are looking for something that western society is failing to provide,” he says. “Despite the fact that it is getting increasingly difficult to dissociate Islam from the political picture, more and more people seem to feel that it provides a solution for something they are looking for.”

Perhaps another surprising finding is that 62 per cent of converts are female while the average age of the convert is 27.5 years. The vast majority of these women adopted the hijab and although the majority personally disagree with the niqab they support the right of others to adopt it.

The study conducted a survey of 122 converts and asked respondents what had been the reasons for their conversion. “The spiritual aspect was more marked in the answers from the women who want an alternative to a materialistic lifestyle,” says Mughal. “For men it was more about a sense of idealism and social justice.”

Conservationists say only two female Asiatic cheetahs are known to be alive in the wild in Iran, which hosts the last surviving population.

Asiatic cheetahs, also known as Iranian cheetahs, are a subspecies of the fastest animal on earth and classified as critically endangered, with fewer than 40 believed to remain in Iran.

As part of efforts to raise the animal’s profile, in the past decade cheetahs have been displayed on the national football team’s kit and on stamps, but it has become increasingly imperilled.

Tuesday was Iran’s national cheetah day, marking an event more than two decades ago when a cub named Marita survived an attack by a group of villagers in which his mother and two siblings were killed. Marita became a national symbol.

Morteza Eslami, head of the Iranian Cheetah Society (ICS), a Tehran-based NGO, said camera traps in areas with the most Asiatic cheetahs had seen just two females in recent months.

“The situation is very critical,” he said. “We have been monitoring the situation closely in the past five years and the population of female Asiatic cheetahs has significantly dropped.”

Delaram Ashayeri, an independent conservationist, said: “Unfortunately the number of female cheetahs has been dwindling. In areas where camera traps have been operating for a long time … we are not seeing many female cheetahs or we’re seeing only carcasses.”

In the past 15 years, 48 cheetahs are believed to have died, seven from natural causes, 21 at the hands of farmers, 15 in car accidents and five as a result of hunting.

Of the two female cheetahs believed to be still alive, one is in Turan national park and the other in the nearby Miandasht reserve.

“In some of our other environmental areas we haven’t had any reports of female cheetahs for at least two years now, including in an area near the city of Yazd where only four male cheetahs survive,” Eslami said.

Two Asiatic cheetahs – a male, Koushki, and a female, Delbar – are held in captivity at Tehran’s Pardisan Park research centre. They have not yet successfully mated.

This group of three film-makers takes well-known film scenes starring male actors and reproduces them shot-for-shot with female actors. It's a very simple idea that produces startling and fascinating results. Although this is a fan project and budgets must be tight, clever staging and some inspired direction result in scenes that are great fun to watch. There's even a reworked Star Trek scene, but its pure JJ Abrams – no wobbly sets here.

The Bechdel test offers a simple way of looking at how a film treats its female characters. To pass the test, a film should have at least two female characters who have names and talk to each other about something other than men. Of course, these gender-flipped clips all pass this test with flying colours. With meaty, male roles in their possession, the women in each clip have long, interesting conversations. But it's depressing how many real films fail this pretty basic test. I'm sure the original versions of the movies that have been given the Girls on Film treatment – Star Trek, Fight Club and The Town – don't come close.

Women are underrepresented on- and off-screen in the sausage-fest that is the film industry. The lazy thinking goes that male audience members can only identify with another man, but ever-helpful women will do the extra work required to identify with someone of the opposite sex. I think this is simply untrue; women put up with the fact that they have to do a certain amount of empathising with a male lead character to enjoy most films, but women are crying out for more films with female protagonists. So much so that the rare films that do feature women often do astoundingly well: Twilight, Sex and the City and Mamma Mia are films that drew a huge female audience –and perplexed some – but I'd offer that the big reason why these movies were hits was simply because they featured central female characters who actually got to do things.

The Girls on Film project also raises a more subtle point. Do we need more films about what is typically seen as "female", or do we just need to relax more about which roles women can play? What is most astonishing about these gender-switched scenes is how well they work. The Girls on Film deliberately choose the most blo

There are seemingly endless programs and advocates to increase the participation of women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) as a means of addressing the gender imbalance, which is particularly dramatic at the graduate and doctoral levels.

The National Science Foundation has special grant programs. The White House emphasizes the issue. Efforts are made at the elementary and secondary school levels to increase participation by girls.

One of my daughters was a computer science major in college (the only female CS major that year), so I’m well aware of the extensive outreach to women.

Despite years of concerted efforts, the STEM gender imbalance has barely moved. Men still dominate, by a lot.

But the gender imbalance is equal or even more dramatic in fields dominated by women, as this chart shows (via AEI, h/t Ron Coleman):

For the fifth year in a row, women in 2013 earned a majority of doctoral degrees. … Therefore, 2009 marked the year when men officially became the “second sex” in higher education by earning a minority of college degrees at all college levels from associate’s degrees up to doctoral degrees. 2. By field of study, women earning doctoral degrees in 2013 outnumbered men in 7 of the 11 graduate fields tracked by the CGS (see top chart above): Arts and Humanities (52.3% female), Biology (51.3%, and one of the STEM fields), Education (67.7%), Health Sciences (71,7)%, Public Administration (64.2%), Social/Behavioral Studies (61.8%) and Other fields (50.5%).

I would like to enter a woman the way any man can, and to be entered—to leave and to be left—to be hot and hard and soft all at the same time in the cause of our loving. I would like to drive forward and at other times to rest or be driven. When I sit and play in the waters of my bath I love to feel the deep inside parts of me, sliding and folded and tender and deep. Other times I like to fantasize the core of it, my pearl, a protruding part of me, hard and sensitive and vulnerable in a different way. I have felt the age-old triangle of mother father and child, with the “I” at its eternal core, elongate and flatten out into the elegantly strong triad of grandmother mother daughter, with the “I” moving back and forth flowing in either or both directions as needed. Woman forever. My body, a living representation of other life older longer wiser. The mountains and valleys, trees, rocks. Sand and flowers and water and stone. Made in earth.”-Audre Lorde

This quote is rather poetic and I have allowed myself to see lots of things in it that I don’t know if Lorde actually intended. These are some things I see when I look at these words.

Lorde has described wanting the best qualities of her mother and father and wanting to be both hard and soft during sex. When I read this I thought about how people are expected to limit their self-expression and interests to what society believes is appropriate for their sex, and Lorde is refusing to limit herself that way. She wants the full human experience, not just a half of it. Gender roles and

A new VICE documentary, which was published on Tuesday follows the story of intersex parent Del LaGrace Volcano, an American photographer, who is raising children outside of the confines of gender stereotypes.

In Sweden, state-funded gender-neutral kindergartens are on the rise. According to the documentary, a gender-neutral personal identifier, “hen,” is commonly used throughout Swedish society. Del’s child, Mika, who was born a biological male, wears dresses and has long hair, which is often styled with braids that are dyed pink.

During a portion of the documentary in which Del takes Mika and Nico out shopping, they run into a family they know with a young child who is also being raised without a gender. A biological male, Cory wears dresses and ties his hair back in a pony tail. “Now he has started to see that he’s a girl. The other day he’s a boy and sometimes he’s a cat,” Cory’s mother says. “It’s good for him. It’s a part of his childhood.” She goes on to say something quite significant: “He can be whoever he wants or dress however he wants for that short time because society will have its toll on him anyway.” There is an implicit suggestion that social conditioning almost exclusively defines gender. Later, Cory tells the VICE reporter that his favorite piece of clothing is his Spiderman costume.

In the absence of a complete hormonal transition, the most radical form of gender expression possible is gender dissidence, meaning a comprehensive personal rejection of the aspects of gender that are truly social. These aspects may include fashion and hair style, personal pronouns, hobbies and interests, etc.

But research that was recently published in Stanford University’s Magazine on Medicine reminds us that nature limits our ability to act creatively with our gender expression. In an article on the difference in the male and female brain, author Bruce Goldman highlights the innate biological differences that lead to the development of recognizable behavior patterns in males and females.

Goldman points to research on rhesus monkeys, which revealed that to a significant degree that there are real differences in the wiring of male and female brains. In the study, male monkeys strongly preferred toys with wheels, while female monkeys gravitated towards soft, plush, toys. Goldman argues that because these monkeys weren’t molded by their parents or simian society to enjoy specific toys, their interests

Tannen Campbell filed in a Florida court [PDF] this week accusing the virtual-reality startup of maintaining a "hostile environment" and a "macho bullying atmosphere." She claimed she was fired after she challenged CEO Rony Abovitz on the "depths of misogyny in Magic Leap's culture."

As VP of strategic marketing and brand identity, Campbell says part of her job was to help the tech company with what it called its "pink/blue problem" (quick hint: not calling gender inequality a "pink/blue problem" is probably a good first step).

The pinkness was also literally an issue: the all-male tech team (who were matched by the all-male advertising and executive teams) were asked to consider how to make their augmented reality headset more female friendly and, according to Campbell, the only solution they arrived at was to produce a version in pink.

The lawsuit then offers a wide range of accusations of sexism, stemming from tetchy to highly personal to jaw-dropping. For starters, she took issue with the fact that the Florida company's jobs page was titled "Wizards wanted," seemingly shutting out women.

She then goes on to slam the CFO for being "the kind of man who sits a little too close to women," and the VP of IT for being loud and making "misogynistic comments." She even turns on the company's most senior woman, its chief business officer, accusing her of being "the perfect Magic Leap female employee: she went to Harvard, never disagrees with Abovitz and always does Abovitz's bidding."

Presentation

Before you start writing off Campbell, however, she goes into some depth on the practices and approaches she recommended Magic Leap adopt in order to bring about a more balanced workplace, and they are good. Although some are perhaps more of a wish list – such as paying for a recruiter to help the partners of female hires relocated to Florida to find jobs as well to help ease the move to the company, and paying for female tech leaders including Sheryl Sandberg and Meg Whitman to attend company meetings as speakers.

She developed a presentation for CEO Abovitz but her scheduled meeting to go over it was cancelled no fewer than six times. It took her eight months to get the meeting, and then he terminated the meeting about halfway through. Efforts

<|begin_of_text|>"Men stick with the men and women stick with the women."

When I first entered into recovery from a substance use disorder at age of 24, there were many things that confused me about the rhetoric of the recovery communities. Much of this confusion was easily attributed to years of accumulated mental fog still wafting away from my healing brain, however some things were just flat out puzzling to me even on the clearest of days. There were many rules to learn when it came down to what it meant to be a young person in recovery, but the heavily heterosexist concepts regarding who I should socialize with, who I ought to select as my "sponsor" and how I ought to conduct myself were the most confusing of all. Unfortunately, much of the literature produced by the mutual aid groups I was mandated to attend did nothing at all to alleviate my confusion. I, instead, found myself in the painfully familiar place of feeling like perhaps I didn't quite fit into this world.

With the risk of developing a substance use disorder as much as 20-30 % higher for individuals who identify as LGBTQ+, it is baffling to me that heterosexism still pervades large pockets of the recovery communities. Just as those of us living with white privilege can be largely unaware of this privilege and what life is like for those without it, so too can heterosexual individuals often be unaware of the privilege they hold and what life is like for those without it. While for many folks, the idea of suggesting that "men stick with the men and women stick with the women" seems to be sound advice, this suggestion totally discounts the reality of gender identity being far more than a binary of male or female. It also ignores the fact that sexual orientation actually exists on a vast and fluid spectrum that includes so much more than just a firm heterosexual.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

In the week that the armed forces' LGBT conference takes place in London, Chris Root, a former soldier, still has painful memories of being thrown out of the army for being a lesbian.

When Root joined up in 1970, aged 17, she could not have imagined that she would be discharged just before she completed her four years in the Royal Army Armoured Corps with "services no longer required" stamped on her papers.

"When I joined up I was away from the influences of men and the pressure to conform to heterosexuality. I soon experienced a different world," said Root. "One where lesbian relationships were accepted amongst the other female soldiers."

The armed forces have held lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender conferences since 2000, when the restrictions on gay men and women serving were lifted. Friday's event will provide a platform to raise issues, and for senior managers to take soundings from the LGBT community to inform policy development.

For the first time, the conference includes not only the LGBT community, but also the military's leaders, policy makers and welfare officers.

Before the law was overturned by the European court of human rights, it was illegal to be openly gay or lesbian in the armed forces. Today, according to the gay rights pressure group Stonewall, the RAF and Royal Navy are among the 100 most gay-friendly employers.

Root, a radar operator, began having sexual relationships with other female soldiers soon after joining up but was quickly made aware that discovery would result in investigation by the Special Investigations Branch (SIB).

"Everyone was terrified of the SIB," said Root, who had begun to suspect that she was being scrutinised under the "McCarthy-like regime". Unable to cope with the pressure, Root handed herself in to the SIB 100 days before her four years were up. "The dread of having my personal possessions raked through and my friends questioned became unbearable."

Root says that other women under suspicion were dragged out of bed in the middle of the night, made to put on full dress uniform, and interrogated for days.

"You would be asked to grass up other women and to disclose intimate details of your sex life. They would break you down until you did not know who you were.

"I had seen it happen to other women. But I could never have imagined how bad it was for me. Those remaining days felt like 100 years."

This situation is disgusting for at least three reasons (given time, I’m sure I could find a lot more). The first is that the state thinks it is its business to tell kids that they can’t have it off with other kids. Sure, it has the legal right to do so, but as anyone with any brains knows, legal and moral aren’t the same thing and unless one party is 14 and the other is 30 the state should keep its grubby mitts out of people’s bedrooms – the stat rape laws should be there to protect kids from adults, not from one another.

The second reason this is disgusting is that if Kaitlyn were a boy she would at this very moment be in a jail cell serving a lengthy sentence and being the victim of not-so-statutory rape. The only reason there is such a shit storm over this case is that she is a female and, to a lesser extent, because she is gay and this latter fact has gotten the liberal media pissed off — it’s a confluence of good, old fashioned female privilege and a new fangled dislike for homophobia. Please, will someone give me an example of an 18 year old boy who has had sex with a girl only a couple of years younger and then been given the support of a massive online petition and gotten the opportunity to go on TV and complain about the case? Come on, just one. Hell, now that I think about it, one isn’t enough! Since hetero males greatly outnumber gay females you would have to come up with a lot more than one just to show equal treatment. Think about it, the great majority of 18 year olds charged with statutory rape are male, yet it is a member of the female minority that gets this big a fuss made over her – it’s analogous to the great majority of those charged with crack offenses in a mostly black city like Detroit being black, yet the furor erupting only in one of the few cases in which it’s a white guy caught with a crack pipe up his ass! Fact is, as badly as Hunt is being treated, things would be far darker were she not female and gay – she certainly wouldn’t have the Florida ACLU referring (albeit correctly) to her behavior as “both fairly innocuous and extremely common.” “Predatory, misogynist and an

A few months ago, a post with a shocking claim about misogyny in America began to circulate on Tumblr, the social media site popular with older teens and young adults. It featured a scanned book page section stating that, according to “recent survey data,” when junior high school students in the Midwest were asked what they would do if they woke up “transformed into the opposite sex,” the girls showed mixed emotions but the boys’ reaction was straightforward: “‘Kill myself’ was the most common answer when they contemplated the possibility of life as a girl.” The original poster — whose comment was, “Wow” —identified the source as her “Sex & Gender college textbook,” The Gendered Society by Michael Kimmel.

The post quickly caught on with Tumblr’s radical feminist contingent: in less than three months, it was reblogged or “liked” by over 33,000 users. Some appended their own comments, such as, “Yeah, tell me again how misogyny ‘isn’t real‘ and men and boys and actually ‘like,’ ‘love‘ and ‘respect the female sex‘? This is how deep misogynistic propaganda runs… As Germaine Greer said, ‘Women have no idea how much men hate them.'”

Yet, as it turns out, the claim reveals less about men and misogyny than it does about gender studies and academic feminism.

I was sufficiently intrigued to check out Kimmel’s reference: a 1984 book called The Longest War: Sex Differences in Perspective by psychologists Carol Tavris and Carole Wade. The publication date was the first tipoff that the study’s description in the excerpt was not entirely accurate: the “recent” data had to be about thirty years old. Still, did American teenage boys in the early 1980s really hold such a dismal view of being female?

When I obtained a copy of The Longest War, I was shocked to discover that the claim was not even out of context: it seemed to have no basis at all, other than one comment among examples of negative reactions from younger boys (the survey included third- through twelfth-grade students, not just those in junior high). Published in 1983 by the Institute for Equality in Education, the study had some real fodder for feminist arguments: girls generally felt they would be better off as males while boys generally saw the switch as a disadvantage, envisioning more social restrictions and fewer career options (many responses seemed based on

A demonstration “banning” men was held in downtown Montreal Tuesday night by a feminist group opposing the Couillard government’s austerity measures. Several hundred women gathered at Norman-Bethune Square near Concordia University for the protest. A strong police protest observed from both sides of the march, which began by heading north on Guy St. At times, the women chanted “Sexist police sexist, feminist resistance.” The organizers had warned on Facebook that male protesters and journalists would not be tolerated in the march. The event was trans inclusive. Many feminists prefer to gather in same-sex environments, organizers explained on the Facebook group dedicated to the event, to justify their refusal to accommodate male protesters. One person was arrested for a P6 municipal violation. The protest ended before 11 p.m. Since the protests against austerity began, several feminist groups have emerged to protest government decisions and the impact they have specifically on women. The Quebec Women’s Federation recently said that the cuts to the state affect women disproportionately, because they make up 75 per cent of personnel in public sector jobs.

This is rich: 75% of women are in these public sector jobs, meaning that the jobs are only made up of 25% men. So women are now protesting that their disproportionate share of these jobs getting cuts is sexist, but apparently it's not sexist to have it only be 25% men making up the jobs in personnel. Also, I wonder how many of these female-dominated state jobs in Canada are being funded by male taxpayers. Maybe Canadian men should just go on strike and let the female taxpayers pick up the slack to help their "sisters." Maybe Canadian men are already going on strike as their employment rates are sinking while women's rates are increasing:

Employment has grown more rapidly among women than men. Between 1976 and 2012, the employment rate for women rose from 41.9% to 57.9%, a 16.0 percentage point increase. On the other hand, the employment rate for men declined by 6.9 percentage points from 72.7% in 1976 to 65.8% in 2012.

Adultery Laws in India

Adultery is a voluntary consensual relationship between a married individual and someone who is not his/her lawful spouse. Adultery is considered as legally wrong and is a punishable offense. The act of adultery is a crime which breaches the marriage vows and is detrimental to public morals. It is regarded as illegal in some countries and certain laws have been passed to keep a check over adultery. Although adultery is not a criminal offense, it may have legal consequences and the individual concerned may be penalized and punished especially if the case is pertaining to divorce.

History: In ancient Greece and Roman world, there were harsh laws against adultery but these were applicable only if the female was married. But these laws were not relevant if a man maintained sexual relationship with a slave or an unmarried female. The Bible too forbids adultery and the seventh commandment clearly states this. In customary Judaism, both the parties were equally responsible for adultery but it applied only if the female partner was married. Lord Jesus also abhorred adultery and considered that even looking at a female lustfully is equivalent to adultery.

According to ancient Hindu laws, only the felonious female were punished and killed while the husbands were considered equal to god and were left off with warnings only.

Adultery laws: The legal definition of adultery varies from country to country. Laws related to adultery vary from statute to statute and at some places adultery is considered a crime and the adulterer may even have to face death penalty while at some places it is not punishable. In few statutes, if either individual is married to someone else, both parties to an adulterous liaison are culpable to the crime. Christian, Jewish, Islamic and Hindu traditions condemn the act of adultery and in Islam; the adulterers especially the female may be stoned to death. According to Indian jurisdiction, the adultery law comes under Section 497 of the Indian penal code. There are two laws pertaining to adultery:-

Section-497- Adultery “Whoever has sexual intercourse with a person who is and whom he knows or has reason to believe to be the wife of another man, without the consent or connivance of that man, such sexual intercourse not amounting to the offence of rape, is guilty of the offence of adultery, and shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to five years, or with fine, or with both. In such case, the wife shall not be punishable as an abettor.”

That’s the extraordinary revelation from a high-profile female Sydney vascular surgeon on sexism in the medical profession.

Dr Gabrielle McMullin told ABC radio the worst thing victims could do was complain.

She detailed the story of “Caroline”, whose career was ruined after she was sexually assaulted by a surgeon who took her under his wing.

“She was horrified, she ran out of the office, she didn’t tell anyone,” Dr McMullin said.

Later, the same surgeon began to give the Caroline bad reports. She eventually reported the case and after a long legal battle, won.

“Despite that victory, she has never been appointed to a public position in a hospital in Australasia,” Dr McMullin told AM.

“Her career was ruined by this one guy asking for sex.

“Realistically, she would have been much better to have given him a blow job on that night.

“What I tell my trainees is if you are approached for sex, probably the safest thing to do in terms of your career is to comply with the request.

“The worst thing you could possibly do is to complain to the supervising body.

“You can be sure that you will never be appointed to a major public hospital.”

Dr Saxon Smith, president of the Australian Medical Association in NSW, told the ABC sexual harassment was not tolerated and women should speak out and not allow it to continue.

He denied there were implications for a woman’s career if she spoke out.

“Medicine has moved in the last 20 years. Sure, if you go back further than that — yes, it may well have been the case,” Dr Smith said.

“But we know increasingly — and the trend is — that every graduating year for medicine is more female than male as far as the graduate numbers and as such, there is a tide to turn.”

Sadly, this is what my life is reduced to as a parent: simultaneously waiting to transport him to the next destination and living vicariously through his activities, which are far more interesting than my own.

Welcome to Adulthood.

A few weeks back, I found myself with a dead phone battery and yet another hour to kill in Guitar Center while he practiced grooves and other timekeeping rudiments. I wandered aimlessly between the enclosed acoustic room, synthesizer and smoke-machine area, and a teetering pyramid of bongos labeled “Slashed to the Lowest Price!” Bored out of my mind, I was looking at everything and nothing at all when I made a disturbing discovery on the infamous Music-Store Corkboard.

I couldn’t believe my eyes. Did these still exist? Indeed, they do! Incredibly, the Corkboard used to be the sole means for band auditions outside of an expensive want ad in the local paper. It was an integral communication hub for musicians — no music store, recording studio or practice space failed to have one.

Intrigued, I knew I had stumbled upon either a music-scene artifact or an odd collective of Internet-challenged musicians. Unbelievably, there were people out there who still posted handwritten flyers and want ads for their bands. My attention arrested, I had to read every scrap of paper attached by pushpin in this 3’x5’ frame.

But what initially seemed like a convenient and nostalgic time-waster quickly turned into something else. I found myself altogether pissed off. I was bothered by so many offerings that had an uncanny similarity: “Female Musician Wanted." Yet it wasn’t the ads themselves but the expectations that accompanied them, said or unsaid.

These notices for female musicians all came with a strict list of orders. They weren't requests for specialized skill sets like some other ads contained — those presumably targeted toward male musicians — but orders you might give a subordinate employee or a wayward teenager. They were, well, downright insulting. The dichotomy was clear and understood: Male musicians were intrinsically talented; females were not and subsequently should be managed as such.

The ads I read literally called for female musicians to be “drama-free,” no “druggies,” or to “have transportation!” They did

The value of zie

English, and most other languages, only make use of gendered pronouns for people. Someone is always "he" or "she"; the pronoun "it" is only used for inanimate objects and animals, in some cases. This leads to the problem of how to refer to the abstract single individual, in phrases such as "Once the user has performed this task, he/she/it should then..." Typically, the masculine third-person singular is used, though many people view this as sexist or simply incorrect. Some people use the feminine, but this can lead to confusion, as many think that using the feminine form specifically means only female individuals. Additionally, under normal usage, there is no way to differentiate between the general case and those times when one wants to refer only to male individuals. Many people simply use the plural ("they", "them"), but this is grammatically incorrect. A solution is to come up with a set of third-person singular gender-neutral pronouns. Over the years, several such sets have been proposed, with the following being the best variant of the most popular family.

Subject Object Possessive

Adjective Possessive

Pronoun Reflexive zie zim zir zirs zimself they them their theirs themselves

Subject Zie looked at the thing. Object The person looked at zim. Possessive Adjective It was zir thing. Possessive Pronoun The thing was zirs. Reflexive The person did it zimself.

There are many positive aspects that recommend this set over others. All the forms are sufficiently similar to feel unified. None of them sound so similar to existing pronouns as to be indistinguishable, but they remind one of them. In fact, some forms are similar to the masculine and others to the feminine, without favoring either one overall. The analogy between the endings and those of the third-person plural make it easier to remember and understand. Additionally, the lack of repetition aids clarity and is simply an example of good design. (Some forms of actual pronouns repeat, such as the object and possessive adjective forms of "her".) Lastly, this set already has a head start over most competitors, having achieved a level of acceptance among many online communities.

<|begin_of_text|>Leaders of a Tempe mosque have decided that if congregant Sumayyah Dawud wants to continue attending prayers and other community functions at the Islamic Community Center, she must either dress and pray as a man or provide medical documentation that she is anatomically female.

Though Dawud was born male, she has been legally female since 2011 — her Arizona driver's license and U.S. passport list her as such. She converted to Islam in 2013 and, until recently, says no one has raised any questions about her identity.

But earlier this summer, a handful of her fellow community members went to the ICC board of directors with concerns that she was not actually female and said having her pray with them in the women’s section made them uncomfortable.

(Dawud is not sure exactly what prompted these people to approach the board, but she suspects it has something to do with her increasingly public image as a left-wing activist and the feeling among many in the Muslim community that protesting is not "the Islamic way of doing things.")

Sumayyah Dawud at a recent protest Miriam Wasser

Dawud became the center of what she calls an inappropriate investigation into her personal history and has been thrust into what might just be one of the next frontiers for the Muslim community.

Dawud first became aware of any sort of issue in July when she was called into the office of Nedal Fayad, chairman of the ICC Board of Directors, and asked point blank if she was male or female.

“He told me that they had done a background investigation on me and found stuff that said I used to be assigned male,” Dawud says, adding that not only does she feel her privacy was violated, but this is an issue “that’s none of their business.”

However, hoping to quell any concern and put the matter behind her, Dawud provided two forms of government identification showing she was a woman. She was told the documentation wasn’t enough and that they would need medical proof before they could permit her to continue attending the mosque.

Despite feeling humiliated by the whole experience, Dawud gave Fayad medical documentation from her primary-care physician that stated she was female. She says he promised not to show the documents to anyone without her permission and assured her that this entire matter would remain confidential.

“I thought the issue was resolved,” Dawud says.

But then, a woman Dawud says she previously had considered an acquaintance told her to get out of the women’s section because she wasn’t really a woman. Dawud says she

<|begin_of_text|>The racism of evolution theory has been documented well and widely publicized. It is known less widely that many evolutionists, including Charles Darwin, also taught that women are biologically inferior to men. Darwin's ideas, including his view of women, have had a major impact on society. In a telling indication of his attitude about women (just before he married his cousin, Emma Wedgewood), Darwin listed the advantages of marrying, which included: "... constant companion, (friend in old age) who will feel interested in one, object to be beloved and played with—better than a dog anyhow—Home, and someone to take care of house..." (Darwin, 1958:232,233).

Darwin reasoned that as a married man he would be a "poor slave,... worse than a Negro," but then reminisces that, "one cannot live the solitary life, with groggy old age, friendless... and childless staring in one's face...." Darwin concludes his discussion on the philosophical note, "there is many a happy slave" and shortly thereafter, married (1958:234).

Darwin concluded that adult females of most species resembled the young of both sexes and from this and the other evidence, "reasoned that males are more evolutionarily advanced than females" (Kevles, 1986:8). Many anthropologists contemporary to Darwin concluded that "women's brains were analogous to those of animals," which had "overdeveloped" sense organs "to the detriment of the brain" (Fee, 1979:418). Carl Vogt, a University of Geneva natural history professor who accepted many of "the conclusions of England's great modern naturalist, Charles Darwin," argued that "the child, the female, and the senile white" all had the intellect and nature of the "grown up Negro" (1863:192). Many of Darwin's followers accepted this reasoning, including George Romanes, who concluded that evolution caused females to become, as Kevles postulated:

... increasingly less cerebral and more emotional. Romanes... shared Darwin's view that females were less highly evolved than males—ideas which he articulated in several books and many articles that influenced a generation of biologists. Romanes apparently saw himself as the guardian of evolution, vested with a responsibility to keep it on the right path.... University of Pennsylvania... paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope wrote that male animals play a "

The person at the other end of the line is Aristophanes 貍貓, a Taiwanese MC Boucher stumbled upon on SoundCloud and recruited to spit on an album track called "SCREAM."

From what we know about Aristophanes 貍貓 so far, she teaches creative writing to kids by day and raps in mandarin over lurching, glitchy beats by night. Sometimes, she goes by the nickname Pan, and she's been known to pepper her sexy, sinister-sounding verses with the odd Gabriel Garcia Marquez reference or capitalist critique. Over Skype, Boucher asks Aristophanes what it's like being a female rapper on her city's local hip-hop circuit, and the artists bond over the difficulties of working in a male-dominated industry. “I think being female is sometimes so weird,” Aristophanes replies. “Sometimes at my gigs, the male MCs and producers will say, ‘That’s not rap; that’s not hip-hop.’ Maybe because they’re judging my skill. I can’t feel very comfortable hanging out with them, so I just stay in my home and spend more time on music.”

Dip into Aristophanes 貍貓's SoundCloud, though, and you'll be glad that she's not paying the haters any mind. Her flow sounds like nothing else we've ever heard, flitting quickly and unpredictably between a high-pitched sing-song, a conspiratorial whisper, and a full-bodied groan; the beats she chooses are invariably dark, ominous, and full of bursts of industrial noise. Granted, we don't know exactly what she's rapping about, but she definitely seems to KNOW what she's saying.

<|begin_of_text|>OTTAWA – Canadian veterans are at "significantly higher risk" of death by suicide than the general public, according to a first of its kind federal study that found young male veterans, and female veterans overall, are at the highest risk.

Male veterans had a 36 per cent higher risk of death by suicide than the general population, while female veterans had an 81 per cent higher risk than the general population.

Male veterans are 1.4 times more likely to die by suicide compared to the general male population.

Female veterans have an 1.8 times higher risk of death by suicide compared to the general female population.

Young male veterans are at the highest risk. Male veterans under 25 years of age have a 242 per cent higher risk of death by suicide compared to the general population of males younger than 25.

The risk of suicide for male and female veterans has been stable over the last four decades, the study found.

The findings are part of the "2017 Veteran Suicide Mortality Study" released by Veterans Affairs Canada on Thursday. The study looked at a span of 37 years—between 1976 and 2012 -- of Canadian mortality data from Statistics Canada, as well as the military career records of 200,734 former Canadian Armed Forces personnel.

Over the 37 years of the study, 1,421 male veterans, and 65 female veterans died by suicide, according to the minister's office.

Prior Veterans Affairs Canada studies have found a higher pervasiveness of mental health issues among veterans.

It is the first ever time the federal government has collated data on veteran suicide and the government intends to use the study’s findings to inform suicide prevention for veterans.

"The Veteran Suicide Mortality Study is an important step to understanding suicide within our Veteran population and help us create programs and services that deal with the issue effectively," said Veterans Affairs Minister Seamus O’Regan in a statement to CTV News.

In October, the federal government announced a suicide prevention strategy which aims to improve services and supports offered to members of the military and veterans, to try to reduce the number of suicides among Canadian soldiers.

"It’s a difficult thing to talk about, because it’s not numbers. These are real people, real families, there’s devastation in the wake of a suicide. All I can tell you is that we’re going to keep trying. We’ll keep applying effort, get people into mental health care and do everything we can using best practices and partnering with as many people and as many organizations as we have

Madonna has described her feelings of “heartbreak” and “betrayal” in the wake of Donald Trump’s US election win, claiming: “It feels like women betrayed us.”

During her interview with Billboard, which has crowned her Woman of the Year, the pop star compared her despair regarding the results – particularly the significant number of women who voted for Trump – to mourning.

Why did women vote for Trump? Because misogyny is not a male-only attribute Read more

“I feel that way every morning; I wake up and say, ‘Oh, wait, Donald Trump is still the president,’ and it wasn’t a bad dream that I had. It feels like women betrayed us. The percentage of women who voted for Trump was insanely high,” she says.

When asked why she thought so many women – according to CNN 53% of white women voted for Trump – Madonna replied:

Women hate women. That’s what I think it is. Women’s nature is not to support other women. It’s really sad. Men protect each other, and women protect their men and children. Women turn inward and men are more external. A lot of it has do with jealousy and some sort of tribal inability to accept that one of their kind could lead a nation. Other people just didn’t bother to vote because they didn’t like either candidate, or they didn’t think Trump had a chance in the world. They took their hands off the wheel and then the car crashed.

Earlier this week, Madonna criticised Trump and said she was ashamed to be an American during a performance and auction that raised more than $7.5m (£5.9m) for her Malawi foundation.

Images of the president-elect appeared behind her as she sang the lyrics to Britney Spears’s Toxic.

The singer also revealed that she had previously been photographed in Trump’s bed – for a magazine shoot when he was not at home. She made jokes about his “cheap sheets”, saying: “They won’t be Egyptian cotton because we all know how he feels about Muslims, don’t we?”<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Acid throwing is in the news these days due to the prevalence of this crime in South Central Asia. Reported statistics show victims to be about 80% female. Statistics on the sex of the perpetrator are much harder to find (and have not been located by UHoM yet). The epidemic of acid attacks started, we are told, in the 1980s. These crimes are, every reasonable person would agree, are of the most cruel kind and are deserving of the most extreme condemnation. Yet the specialists who make an effort to publicize this horrible crime epidemic are classifying it as a “gender issue.” The term “gender” when used in such a way universally connotes “women,” specifically in the sense of “victimization of women by men.” Perhaps this classification accurately represents the proportion of each sex in the victim category, but it does not accurately disclose the fact that a huge number of the perpetrators are women, women who choose to commit atrocious crimes on other individuals.

Let us try to overcome the confusion caused by the distorting lens of “gender” rhetoric by looking at a few cases remote in both place and time from those which are currently being, correctly, publicized.

Acid attacks were in the past a common crime in the US and occurred in Europe as well.

Since female criminality has been severely under-served by researchers ever since the beginning of criminology it is worthwhile to examine a sampling of such cases. The most overlooked category of criminal violence in terms of sex of perpetrator and sex of victim is, of course, female against female.

The three cases of female acid attackers presented here, all occurring in the same city in the same year are each quite different: one perpetrator threw acid on another woman, one threw acid on a man and another who threw acid on herself

<|begin_of_text|>The Volvo YCC ("Your Concept Car")[1] was a concept car made by Volvo Cars presented at the 2004 Geneva Motor Show, with the stated goal of meeting the particular needs of female drivers. In order to do so, Volvo assembled a design team entirely made up of women, around October 2001. It was a major exercise in ergonomics from the perspective of a female driver.

Those who were involved during the several stages of the project were: Maria Widell Christiansen, Eva-Lisa Andersson, Elna Holmberg, Maria Uggla, Camilla Palmertz, Cynthia Charwick, Anna Rosén, Lena Ekelund, and Tatiana Butovitsch Temm.

On the outside the car looked, at first glance, like a mildly futuristic four seat coupé. On closer inspection, one could see that there was no hood, that is, no access panel permitting access to the car’s engine. Engine maintenance required taking out the whole front end of the car body, preferably in some establishment with the required space and equipment. This was not supposed to happen often, as the engine was designed to need an oil change only after 50,000 km (31,000 mi) and to automatically send a radio message to a garage a short time before any required maintenance.

Filling the windshield washer tank was done by a capless ball valve, right next to the capless gas tank ball valve. Volvo surveys had found (among many other things) that female drivers considered caps to be a major nuisance. The car featured run-flat tires, like those of wheeled armoured vehicles, in order to be able to drive all the way to a garage after a puncture and thus avoid having to change a tire by the side of the road.

Entry into the car was by the means of two gull-wing doors on the sides. The concept was a three door, four seat coupe design. It also had an upwards opening hatchback door giving access to the trunk and cargo area.

All three doors were motorized for a sensor based “keyless” entry. Pressing on a single button on the keychain automatically opened the nearest door, making it easy for somebody holding bags of groceries or other sundries to get the things in the car without putting anything down. The interior was maximized for easy storage and good looks.

All of the textile panels or textile parts such as the seat pads or the door sides could be removed easily to change the color schemes and vary textures.

Once inside the dreadfully corrupt Orleans Parish Prison (OPP), we are reduced to our genitals and become just another number. When those of us who present as female in gender enter a heteronormative male space where females are not allowed, we are ultimately dehumanized. We become not only property of the state, and of the city, but of cisgender male inmates. We are immediately seen as prey by the inmates who view femininity as weakness.

Illustration by Charlie Poulson

I was 21 years old when I was first arrested. I was out doing sex work, just trying to survive. The cop took me to jail, unlike the others who picked me up and threatened to take me in if I didn’t perform oral sex on them. Most trans women would agree the environment in prison is almost like a stage set for depression and suicide. A lot of girls like me don’t even like to stand out anymore because of the constant profiling, so we seek desperately to blend in. Dressing fiercely used to be such a glamorous, extravagant art but society has found a way to force us to blend in. As the saying goes “if they can tell, you’re going to jail!”

That first time in jail was the scariest of all and possibly the time I became infected with HIV. For black trans women, this path is all too familiar. I have my assumption of how I contracted it, but there were honestly so many times I was in jail and participated in unprotected sex out of fear and necessity as a young woman that I can’t be sure. In order to preserve some safety and dignity, I always chose a man before one tried to impose his will on me.

The first ten times I was arrested I had little to no family support, so if I wanted anything more than what little the state provided while I was inside, I had to use what seemed to be at the time my most valuable commodity: my youthful body. I became a prison concubine to career criminals who had been in and out of the prison system nearly their entire lives, many of whom had been with just about every young trans woman who came through the door on sex work charges. We often had shorter stays, creating a turnover rate that allowed the men who were facing serious charges to be with

<|begin_of_text|>I had the idea for this blog post while I was watching some interviews on YouTube. The videos of the Conan show stood out to me because many of them seem to be focused on sexual topics. To me, it looks like they were following the simple “sex sells” approach. Not that there’s something inherently wrong with this, it just appears that Conan uses it much more than other late-night show channels.

This brought me to my main question. Are Conan videos more focused on sexual content than the ones of other late-night shows? I decided to compare its YouTube channel to the official channels of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and The Late Late Show with James Corden.

The public YouTube API allowed me to download the information for all available 12,237 videos. To find out whether a video contains sexual content or not, I compared the video’s title and description against a word list (see below). If the title or description contains at least one of the words, the video will be rated as “contains sexual content”. On top of that, I also checked if the video titles contain names of persons to group the videos into three categories: female, male, and neutral. For example, interviews with actresses fall into the female category, whereas, monologs fall into the neutral category.

The graph above shows that 17% of Conan videos in the female category contain sexual content which is 11% more than the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, the second place. We also can see that the share of Conan videos containing sexual content is twice as large in the female category than in the male category. These numbers confirm the hypothesis that the Conan YouTube channel focuses much more on sexual content than other late-night shows. The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon appears to be the YouTube channel with the cleanest video titles and descriptions.

Bonus: The results left me wondering if suggestive titles help the channels to gain views. I created the following plot with the beanplot R package which shows us that only Conan seems to benefit from sexual video titles or descriptions.

The Brussels politicians said they want to stand against ‘sexist’ education by encouraging children to take an equal interest in all subjects ‘beyond gendered stereotypes’.

They hope that girls will take up scientific and technical subjects while boys could take up activities such as cleaning the home.

MEPs have revealed they want boys to learn about traditionally ‘female’ activities and should be taught domestic work and care at school

Textbooks showing old-fashioned stereotypes about male and female roles would also be thrown out of schools, under the European Parliament’ proposals.

The suggestions were made in the report on Empowering Girls Through Education from the Parliament’s FEMM Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, with MEPs approving the proposals by 408 to 236.

The report says it 'encourages girls and boys in the education process to take an equal interest in all subjects, beyond gendered stereotypes, in particular as regards scientific and technical subjects, including boys’ learning about activities regarded as female, in areas such as domestic work and care’.

The Brussels politicians said they want to stand against ‘sexist’ education by encouraging children to take an equal interest in all subjects ‘beyond gendered stereotypes’

Another point says that schools should be guided ‘to embrace a gender perspective and gender equality, and to ensure the elimination of stereotypes and sexist distortions that textbooks and teaching materials may include in their content.'

It added: '[This will then] encourage them also to combat this sexism in literature, film, music, games, media, advertising and other areas that can contribute decisively to changing the attitudes, behaviour and identity of girls and boys’.

Portuguese socialist MEP Liliana Rodrigues, who spearheaded the proposals, said: ‘We are still living in an unequal Europe…women continue to be a prime target for discrimination and violence. I believe that school plays a fundamental role in changing this.

‘[We want to] create a school culture of gender equality, critically oversee the curricula and educational materials, ensure gender equality with regard to personal and professional decisions and improve the percentage of women in positions of responsibility.’

“If a survey is done, then I am sure that women will be more successful than men when given an opportunity to work," he said.

Last week, Modi proposed in Parliament that only female parliamentarians should speak in Parliament on 8 March—International Women’s Day.

Currently, out of 543 MPs in the Lok Sabha, only 62 are women. However, this is the most on record in the lower house. In the Rajya Sabha, there are 31 women out of 245 MPs.

The prime minister lauded the contribution of women in strengthening the nation. “A country is not made strong by its infrastructure. Every citizen of India strengthens the nation and mothers give strength to these citizens. It is the mothers who have been contributing to nation building for years," he said.

Modi also appealed to female MPs to embrace technology to connect with their respective constituencies. “Women adapt to technology much easier than men. I have received so many enriching thoughts and views through the Narendra Modi app and MyGov.in. All of you can also use technology similarly to stay well-informed about your own areas," he said. Modi suggested that e-platforms be created for female MPs of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.

While appreciating their ability to multitask, the prime minister said that female legislators must further the cause of women’s empowerment in their respective constituencies by holding similar conferences with local women leaders.

Though analysts see Modi’s address as a progressive step, they feel that it is more important to see how his words translate into action.

“Such a statement coming from the prime minister is a big thing and I welcome this new pitch to women’s empowerment, but is it being actioned out? For instance, the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme was launched quite a while ago and we are yet to see progress being made. Let this not be a government of mere slogans, but a government that also works towards fulfilling what it says," said New Delhi-based political analyst Manisha Priyam.

In his 15 August address last year, Modi spoke about the need to acknowledge the gender bias in Indian society and condemned the increasing incidence of rape in the country.

“In every home, parents ask daughters lots of questions as to where she is going, when will she return, and ask her to inform them when she reaches her destination. But have

Targeted violence against female public officials, dismal healthcare and desperate poverty make Afghanistan the world's most dangerous country in which to be born a woman, according to a global survey released on Wednesday.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Pakistan, India and Somalia feature in descending order after Afghanistan in the list of the five worst states, the poll among gender experts shows.

The appearance of India, a country rapidly developing into an economic super-power, was unexpected. It is ranked as extremely hazardous because of the subcontinent's high level of female infanticide and sex trafficking.

Others were less surprised to be on the list. Informed about her country's inclusion, Somalia's women's minister, Maryan Qasim, responded: "I thought Somalia would be first on the list, not fifth."

The survey has been compiled by the Thomson Reuters Foundation to mark the launch of a website, TrustLaw Woman, aimed at providing free legal advice for women's groups around the world.

High maternal mortality rates, limited access to doctors and a "near total lack of economic rights" render Afghanistan such a threat to its female inhabitants. "Continuing conflict, Nato airstrikes and cultural practices combine to make Afghanistan a very dangerous place for women," said Antonella Notari, head of Women Change Makers, a group that supports women social entrepreneurs around the world.

"Women who do attempt to speak out or take on public roles that challenge ingrained gender stereotypes of what is acceptable for women to do or not, such as working as policewomen or news broadcasters, are often intimidated or killed."

The "staggering levels of sexual violence" in the lawless east of the DRC account for its second place in the list. One recent US study claimed that more than 400,000 women are raped there each year. The UN has called Congo the rape capital of the world.

"Rights activists say militia groups and soldiers target all ages, including girls as young as three and elderly women," the survey reports, "They are gang raped, raped with bayonets and some have guns shot into their vaginas."

Pakistan is ranked third on the basis of cultural, tribal and religious practices harmful to women. "These include acid attacks, child and forced marriage and punishment or retribution by stoning or other physical abuse," the poll finds.

Filmed in late 2013 and just now coming to light, the trailer features luxury condos, boats, big drug busts, and of course, scantily clad female Miami police officers.

Union president Lt. Javier Ortiz, who is shown in the video, told the Miami Herald that “when I asked who was taking the video, Orosa told me it was for recruitment purposes.” According to Orosa however, it was never intended for recruitment purposes, but rather for a $40,000 donation to the Police Athletic League, should the show get picked up. But the show never got picked up by a network, and now the promotional trailer is floating around the internet for all to see.

Current Miami police chief Rodolfo Llanes, who claims to have only discovered its existence on Monday, condemned the video for objectifying female officers and said he was going to speak with an attorney.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Elizabeth Blackwell (February 3, 1821 – May 31, 1910) was a British physician, notable as the first woman to receive a medical degree in the United States, and the first woman on the Medical Register of the General Medical Council.[1] Elizabeth Blackwell played an important role in both the United States and the United Kingdom as a social and moral reformer. She acted as a pioneer in promoting the education of women in medicine. Elizabeth Blackwell's contributions remain celebrated through an Elizabeth Blackwell medal that is awarded to one woman every year who has added to the cause of promoting women in medicine.[1] Furthermore, Hobart and William Smith College recently created a statue on their campus honoring Elizabeth Blackwell.[2]

Elizabeth Blackwell was initially uninterested in a career in medicine especially after her schoolteacher brought in a bull's eye to use as a teaching tool.[1] Therefore, she became a schoolteacher in order to support her family. This occupation was seen as suitable for women during the 1800s, however, being a schoolteacher did not interest Blackwell. Blackwell's motivation to go into medicine came after her friend fell ill and suggested that if a female doctor had cared for her, she might not have suffered so much.[1] Blackwell began to apply to medical schools, however, she endured a lot of prejudice due to her gender. She was rejected from all the medical schools she applied to except Geneva Medical College. In 1847 Blackwell became the first woman to attend medical school in the United States.[1]

Elizabeth Blackwell had her inaugural thesis on typhoid fever published in the Buffalo Medical Journal right after she graduated from college in 1849.[3] This article was the first medical article published by a female student from the United States. Her article portrayed a strong sense of empathy and sensitivity to human suffering as well as a strong desire for social and economic justice.[3] This point of view was considered very feminine.[3] Furthermore, in 1857, Blackwell also opened up the New York Infirmary for Women and Children with her sister Emily. She also gave lectures to women about the importance of educating girls.[2]

Early life [ edit ]

Elizabeth was born on February 3, 1821, in Bristol, England, to Samuel Blackwell, who was a sugar refiner, and his wife Hannah (Lane) Blackwell.[4] She had two older siblings, Anna and Marian, and would eventually have six younger siblings:

Allie Rubin Blocked Unblock Follow Following Jun 13, 2015

Nobel Prize winner Sir Tim Hunt recently caused a stir when he argued that male and female scientists should work independently, because women are a distraction to men in the lab. At a conference, he was quoted as saying, “Let me tell you about my trouble with girls… three things happen when they are in the lab… You fall in love with them, they fall in love with you and when you criticize them, they cry.”

As improbable as it might sound, I am a female scientist, and I agree with Tim Hunt.

First of all, Sir Tim’s comments are based on his personal experiences, and are therefore incontrovertible. Three hundred and fifty years ago, Isaac Newton saw an apple fall and decided that gravity existed. Three weeks ago, Tim Hunt saw a woman cry and decided that all women are unfit to be scientists. Science is based on observations, which are the same thing as universal proof. Even I know that, and I’m just a woman whose brain is filled to capacity with yoga poses and recipes for gluten-free organic soap. Once, I was lured into a trap in the woods because I followed a trail of Sex and the City DVDs for three miles into a covered pit. Do you really think I could do something as complicated as thinking about science?

Second, Tim Hunt is correct in asserting that women are distracting to men in a lab setting, which greatly affects their productivity. Last month, my labmates and I had to burn our female coworker at the stake for witchcraft because we saw her holding an unwrapped tampon. Between building the stake, lighting an adequate fire, and waiting for her to die, we lost an entire day that we could otherwise have spent working. I make every effort to not distract my male colleagues; sometimes I have to work on my astrology charts from home when I’m menstruating or have leprosy, just so I can let the men in my lab focus on doing real science. It’s a small sacrifice I make that keeps morale in the lab way up.

Tim Hunt also mentions that men and women are constantly falling in love with each other within the lab. This is true; I used to identify as homosexual before working with a group of bearded men and a set of phallic pipettes turned me straight. Once that happened, I couldn’t stop falling in love with every man I met. One time I fell

I read this comment on Facebook and it hit a nerve with me. My first reaction was, “Why should people be telling others what to eat and what not to eat?” The more I thought about it, the more it bothered me for many reasons.

The argument is that being a feminist means addressing all forms of oppression, including oppression of animals. The animal agricultural industry exploits animals. Female animals are forced to breed through artificial or manual insemination. Their youngs are taken from them prematurely. Female chickens are debeaked and grow to be too big for their legs to carry them. Pigs are penned in cages too small for them to move. The theory is that exploitation of the female animal reproductive system is very relevant to feminists fighting against the patriarchy and fighting for human female reproductive rights. Oppression of animals should intersect with oppression of women.

When vegans or feminists make statements like mentioned above, it can come off as very Western-centric, classist, and elitist.

I’ve never felt like going vegan or vegetarian, not because I didn’t understand the plight for animal rights, but because it is something I can’t identify with.

First and most importantly, Hmong culture is a very big part of my identity, and food is Hmong culture. We (family and friends) gather around food. Food is served at birthday parties, religious ceremonies, celebrations, and even during short visits to family. Food is part of family life.

So, why not substitute meat ingredients with vegan products?

Our ancestors cultivated the lands of Laos, Vietnam, and China for farming and livestock. We brought our culture with us when we immigrated to the US as refugees of war after the Vietnam War.

Religious ceremonies, like hu plig (soul calling), require eggs and the sacrifice of chickens and roosters. Other ceremonies involve sacrificial cows, pigs, and sheep/goats. We need chicken’s blood and feathers for the New Year to create a new shrine for our xwm kab. So, how should we perform or practice our religion if we go vegan? What about the cultural custom of dieting only on boiled chicken and herbs 30 days postpartum?

Meat has always been very precious to the Hmong. We don’t waste anything, so the dishes we cook during feasts are from the meat of the animals we sacrifice for religious ceremonies. Food we eat throughout the year are leftover meat from the same animals.

Four years ago, Republicans had a smashing campaign season, seizing control of the House and piling up victories in Senate and gubernatorial races from sea to shining sea. Some of those swept into office were buoyed by the tea party-fueled wave.

Four years later, many governors now have to defend their seats under less favorable conditions.

That, succinctly, explains the dynamic in this year’s gubernatorial contests, which is more broadly discussed in this article focused on Republican Gov. Sam Brownback’s struggle in deeply red Kansas.

Of the 36 governors races on the ballot this November, 22 are for seats held by Republicans and 14 by Democrats, numbers that work in the Democrats’ favor in contrast to their struggle in House and Senate races.

Here are some gubernatorial contests to watch, based on interviews with nonpartisan analysts Jennifer E. Duffy of the Cook Political Report and Nathan Gonzales of the Rothenberg Political Report, as well as campaign strategists for the two major parties.

REPUBLICAN SEATS THAT DEMOCRATS COULD FLIP:

Florida: Gov. Rick Scott barely won election in 2010 and voters haven't seemed to warm to the former healthcare executive. Perhaps the best thing Scott has going for him is his opponent, Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat Charlie Crist, whose partisan perambulations left him with plenty of critics on all sides.

Kansas: Brownback has pursued an aggressively conservative agenda, highlighted by a record cut in the state’s income tax, which has sent revenues plunging and many moderate Republicans running into the arms of his Democratic opponent, House Minority Leader Paul Davis. Brownback is trying to tie Davis to President Obama, who is overwhelmingly unpopular in the state despite his family roots. (Obama’s mother was a Kansan.)

Georgia: Gov. Nathan Deal has been dogged by an ethics scandal and his bungled response to a freak January snowstorm, among other missteps. The Democratic candidate is Jason Carter, the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, who has been a strong fundraiser and may also benefit from heavy Democratic spending on behalf of U.S. Senate candidate Michelle Nunn, daughter of former Sen. Sam Nunn, who offers the party a rare pickup opportunity against businessman David Perdue.

Not only is she a very fine actress, whether she’s playing stricken with grief, as she did in Broadchurch, or a comedically exasperated trainee nurse stressed out by aliens and chavs in the wonderful little film Attack the Block. She also exudes that quality every good Doctor needs: the everyman touch. Or everyperson touch. The sense that while this creature might be a Time Lord with two hearts and a police-box time machine, he — now she — is nonetheless like us. Special but connectable. Otherworldly but worldly. Whittaker can do that. I think she’ll be brilliant.

But my joy at seeing an actress I admire land a coveted role has been dampened by the crazy reaction to the news. You’d be forgiven for thinking that making the thirteenth Doctor a woman is on a par with women getting the vote. Twitter has evaporated into a paroxysm of joy. This will transform life for the female of the species, apparently. We cannot underestimate ‘how important a female Doctor is’, says the Huffington Post. This casting helps ‘break the glass ceiling’, says a self-congratulatory BBC (inflaming suspicion that it chose Whittaker because she’s a woman rather than because she’s good at her job). Whittaker will inject ‘girl power [into] space and time’, says one observer.

Writing in the Guardian, the sixth Doctor, Colin Baker, says Whittaker’s arrival reverses ‘the exclusion of [the female] gender from the Tardis’ — as if not having a female Doctor was an act of misogynistic repression rather than just a quirk of TV history. A writer for Variety says women have ‘won a victory’. She hails the casting of Whittaker because it ‘sends a message’ — that women and girls will no longer be ‘shut out of seeing themselves on screen in plum roles’. Women don’t land plum roles? Is that true? Tweeting, weeping liberals claim a female Doctor will have a revolutionary impact on their daughters’ sense of self-worth. I don’t know what I find more dubious: the notion that teen girls watch Doctor Who or that a Whittaker Time Lord will boost feminine self-esteem across the land.

The overblown response to the thirteenth Doctor confirms how stupid, and worse, identity politics is. It confirms how obsessed the virtual left is with

The short answer is: we can’t tell! Female scribes worked on many of the same sorts of texts as male scribes and used the same sorts of scripts. Therefore, unless they signed their work or left other clues, there is no way of telling whether a given text was copied by a man or a woman. Luckily, however, there are clues in several relatively early Greek and Latin manuscripts at the British Library, including a letter from the 2nd century BC and an illustrated copy of scientific works from the 12th century.

Diagram of the four seasons and four cardinal directions, from a copy of Isidore's De natura rerum: copied by 8 female scribes at Munsterblisen, c. 1130–1174, Harley MS 3099, f. 156r

The easiest way to tell if a manuscript was created by a female scribe or scribes is if they left in the book a note which recorded their names or details about themselves. Admittedly, these sorts of notes should be treated with caution: sometimes, later scribes could copy a note left by the scribe of their exemplar along with the rest of the text. Still, there seem to be plausible examples which record female scribes. For example, a note in one copy of Isidore of Seville’s Etymologiae and De natura rerum (Harley 3099) claimed it was copied by no less than 8 female scribes from the Benedictine nunnery of Munsterblisen, near Maastricht:

These are the names of those women who wrote [scripserunt] this book: Gerdrut, Sibilia, Vierwic, Walderat, Hadewic, Lugart, Derta, Cunigunt. Indeed, they wrote for those in charge of the monastery [monasteriensibus dominis], that they might ask God for them to free them from punishment and establish them in Paradise. May whoever steals [this book] from them be cursed! [The date 1134 has been added by a later hand.]

The terrorists in the Transportation Security Administration otherwise known as the TSA responded to news of a woman saying that security screeners humiliated her by forcing her to remove body piercings because they set off the metal detector alarm. The woman was forced to remove the piercings with pliers while low class TSA goons laughed at her. The TSA claims that there are numerous incidents of female terrorists hiding explosives in sensitive areas of the human body so that’s why the actions by the security screeners were warranted. It is funny how the TSA declines to list all of these different incidents involving female terrorists hiding explosives around their private areas. The bottom line is that the TSA’s main purpose is not to provide safety but instead to ensure that the American people are acclimated into the 21st century technological enslavement system. How does forcing people to remove body piercings keep the American people safe from terrorism? The whole thing is a joke and the TSA should be abolished and their $10 an hour employees should find their way to an unemployment line.

Here is a blurb from an Associated Press report detailing this particular incident.

A Texas woman who said she was forced to remove a nipple ring with pliers in order to board an airplane called Thursday for an apology by federal security agents and a civil rights investigation.

"I wouldn’t wish this experience upon anyone," Mandi Hamlin said at a news conference. "My experience with TSA was a nightmare I had to endure. No one deserves to be treated this way.”

Hamlin, 37, said she was trying to board a flight from Lubbock to Dallas on Feb. 24 when she was scanned by a Transportation Security Administration agent after passing through a larger metal detector without problems.

The female TSA agent used a handheld detector that beeped when it passed in front of Hamlin’s chest, the Dallas-area resident said. Hamlin said she told the woman she was wearing nipple piercings. The agent then called over her male colleagues, one of whom said she would have to remove the jewelry, Hamlin said.

Hamlin said she could not remove them and asked whether she could instead display her pierced breasts in private to the female agent. But several other male officers told her she could not board her flight until the jewelry was out, she said.

She was taken behind a curtain and managed to remove one bar-shaped piercing but had trouble with the second, a ring.

"Still crying, she informed the TSA officer

<|begin_of_text|>There’s no such thing as “books for boys” and “books for girls.” But because gendering is a cultural phenomenon, brought on by social beliefs that there are inherent and important differences between boys and girls, it’s impossible to escape those ideas. This is why adults continue to lament the lack of books “for boys” in the world. It’s why there are continuous articles and think pieces about what happened to the books “for boys” in kid lit. Even the most well-meaning, socially-conscious adults fall into this trap, believing that the boys are being left behind and that girls and girl interests “dominate” the children’s book world.

But what does it mean for a book to be “for boys?” Is it a male author? Is it a male main character? Is it a book that appeals to the interests of boys specifically, whatever those are?

Today, Amazon released their 2014 top-selling titles. Let’s take a look at what the hits in kids and teens were.

It’s a nice mix of books for very young readers, as well as books for those who are older teen readers. But…tell me where the women are dominating here?

If we were to break down the books by gender — which is subjective and ridiculous, but we’re going to do it — then we could note that male authors constituted 11 of the 20 authors on the list. There were 7 female authors listed and there were two books from Scholastic, with no authorship attached. I did not count Kathryn Limbaugh because the books isn’t selling on her authorship in the least (that’s all Rush), and I did not count Michael Chamberlain because he’s a narrator, not the writer.

If you rolled the Minecraft books into the male author category, which makes sense since Minecraft is a “boy” thing, then you’d show 13 “books for boys” and 7 “books for girls.”

But wait!

Veronica Roth’s Four isn’t about a female character. It’s a collection of short stories about Four, a main male character in her best-selling Divergent series. So let’s move that book over to the “books for boys” category, too. Now we’re up to 14 “books for boys” and 6 “books for girls.” If you’re going to play by that game, too, then R. J. Palacio’s The Julian Chapter is also a “book for boys,” since the main character is a boy and he’s featured

An example is the cross in red colour, which signifies the belief in Trinity by the Christians. Trinity is the worst form of the shirk (polytheism), and is the most detested sin in Islam,” he said.Similarly, the Rod of Asclepius, denotes the Greco-Roman Gods of life and health, he said. “The beliefs that destroys Thouheed (monotheism), the cardinal principle in Islam, should be kept at arm’s length. These kinds of wrong beliefs may unknowingly sneak into the belief system of Muslims and they may distance themselves from Islam. A Muslim doctor should keep away from all the signs and slogans that are against Islam,” he said.The Salafi preacher said a Muslim woman can approach a male Muslim doctor if she fails to find a Muslim female doctor. “The male doctor should look at or touch the female patient only in an unavoidable situation. He should use hand gloves if he decides to touch the female patient,” Muhsin said adding touching without gloves is allowed only in extreme situations.The woman patient should be asked to cover all other parts of her body which do not need examination. The Islamic principle that a male should not be alone with an unknown female is applicable in the case of doctors too. “The presence of husband or ‘mahrams’ is mandatory while being examined by the male doctor, “Muhsin said. (Mahrams are the persons who are allowed to escort a Muslim woman when she travels) “At least a woman from the family of the patient should be present at the time of examination. If all these are not available, the male doctor should examine the patient after the keeping open the door and standing on the other side of a veil,” suggests Muhsin.In his opinion, cosmetic or plastic surgery is not allowed in Islam as it amounts to intervening in

<|begin_of_text|>In September, rental agent Lynne Hubbard sat in a cafe across from Dr. John Getzow, whom she was considering as a potential tenant for a room above O'Reilly's Holy Grail restaurant and bar on Polk Street. He was clean-cut and well dressed. He was a doctor, after all, and he seemed eager to find a place to live. But there was something faintly odd about him.

Getzow, 55, had arranged to meet Hubbard at the Crepe House on Polk. Once he sat down at the table, he told her about his technical consulting firm that helped hospitals with billing software. He went on to say he was active in city politics; he had worked on Mayor Gavin Newsom's campaign, and was currently involved in fund-raising for Senator Barack Obama's bid for the presidency.

At one point Getzow moved aside the coffee mugs on the small table and placed a leather-bound portfolio in front of Hubbard. He flipped through pages of references from former landlords, invoices addressed to hospitals for huge sums — even a letter of recommendation from Newsom's former campaign manager.

"I thought the portfolio presentation was a bit much for a room over O'Reilly's Holy Grail," Hubbard says. "He was trying too hard to impress me, but I wasn't sure why. I thought maybe it was because I'm female."

Considering Getzow's glowing credentials, Hubbard never would have guessed that when she accepted his application for the apartment in Myles O'Reilly's building, his tenancy would eventually cost the landlord thousands of dollars and climax in Getzow's arrest for assault.

As it turned out, Getzow was not a licensed doctor in California, although he did work sporadically as a medical software consultant. He also was not as integral to the political campaigns he had volunteered for. In fact, he was one of the most successful "serial evictees" in San Francisco, a select group of tenants who take advantage of the city's lenient courts and tenant-support nonprofits to tie up landlords in court for months while they live practically rent-free in one of the most expensive cities in the country.

Depending on the vigilance of the landlord, a seasoned serial evictee like Getzow can get away with a minimum of 45 days and sometimes up to a year of free rent. The actual number of serial evictees operating in San Francisco is difficult to track, but some attorneys who specialize in representing landlords estimate there are between 20 and

<|begin_of_text|>The state of Washington may soon follow Oregon and California and allow a third gender option on birth certificates. The proposal would let people change their gender from male or female to the non-binary designation of “X.”

Currently, people born in Washington can petition to change the gender on their birth certificate from male to female or female to male. But there isn’t an option to choose no gender.

That may soon change. Christie Spice with the Washington Department of Health said that’s because society is changing.

“And more people are identifying as a gender other than a male or female and there’s growing demand for non-binary sex designations on all identity documents, including birth certificates,” Spice said.

Under the proposed change, adults could request an “X” designation on their birth certificates. Children could also make the change with the consent of their parents and with a doctor’s note.

The Washington Department of Health will hold a public hearing Tuesday from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. in Tumwater on this proposed rule change. Online comments will be accepted until 5 p.m. Tuesday as well.

The Department of Health has already received about 1,000 written comments both in support and against the change. The new rule could go into effect early next year.

A new Oregon law allowing an “X” designation on birth certificates takes effect on January 1, 2018. In June, Oregon became the first state in the nation to allow a third gender option for driver licenses and state identification cards.

A spokeswoman for Washington’s Department of Licensing said the agency is in the early stages of considering whether it can offer a gender neutral designation on state ID cards.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

(03-03) 22:21 PST SAN FRANCISCO -- A 15-year-old transgender student reported being attacked and sexually assaulted Monday at the same Hercules school where another transgender student was involved in a fight four months ago, police said.

The latest incident - which is being investigated as a hate crime - was reported at Hercules Middle/High School on Refugio Valley Road about 11 a.m. by a transgender student who identifies as male, said Hercules police Detective Connie Van Putten.

The student said he was leaving the boys' bathroom when in a building on the high school part of campus when he was confronted by three male juveniles, Van Putten said.

The three pushed him into the bathroom's disabled stall, where they physically and sexually assaulted him, police said.

The boy's parents were notified, and he was taken to a hospital, Van Putten said.

Police were interviewing witnesses and had not identified suspects.

On Nov. 13, another transgender student, Jewlyes Gutierrez, 16, got into a fight with several students on campus, with a portion of the confrontation caught by a witness's cell-phone camera.

Gutierrez, who was born male but considers herself female, was charged with misdemeanor battery, but if she successfully completes a conflict resolution program, the allegation will be dropped, a judge said last month.

Charles Ramsey, president of the West Contra Costa County Unified School District board, said of Monday's incident, "I want to tell the parents that my heart goes out to them. I feel really bad for the victim."

Ramsey also sounded a warning to the attackers: "You will be expelled. You will be punished, and what we'll ask is that you are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. You can't assault students on campus, no matter who they are."<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

An athlete and a transgender person – that both identities could be conceivable fascinates our media landscape, from the New York Post all the way up to the New York Times. This is perhaps why speculation about Bruce Jenner’s gender identity has been disappointingly rife in recent weeks, even though the athlete has not spoken out about it.

Fallon Fox knows what it’s like to be the focus of rumours and hearsay. She is a mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter – and the first openly trans athlete in the sport’s history.

Fox is intimately familiar with our culture’s treatment of trans athletes. She was not out publicly when she began competing, although licensing commissions knew she was trans. But after Fox began winning, a reporter called her and made it clear he knew she was trans. Fox understood she had to get ahead of the story, so she came out in an Outsports article in March 2013.

When I ask Fox about the obsessive interest in an athlete’s transition, she brings up the retrogressive idea that, despite the fact that there are actually many female athletes, sports are men’s domain. This leads people to see Jenner’s athletic abilities as a sign of maleness, making the possibility that Jenner might be trans a contradiction to gawk at.

I ask Fox about being put in the position of having to come out publicly so early in her career. “That sucked. I expected that someone was going to out me; you just can’t go through life with a microscope on your career without someone delving into your past a little bit,” she says. “But it’s something you really can’t prepare yourself for.” Her face grows serious. “The scope of anger and vitriol that I received initially... That was disheartening, tragic. It was mind-blowing.”

This is not how Fox wanted her career to go. Her dream narrative would have been for her to go in there just like any other fighter would, collecting wins, hopefully ending up the best female fighter on the face of the planet. “I suppose I’d like all of that still,” she says pensively. “But in addition to that, I want to bring my people with me.”

Fox’s interest in MMA stemmed from the fact that

Since its creation in the 1970s, the Star Wars franchise has never been big on gender representation. Although both trilogies had iconic female characters like Princess Leia and Queen Padme Amidala, both came to us neatly wrapped in Hollywood tropes and gender stereotypes.

While Leia's strong character, who was also a badass leader, was exemplary for her time, her gratuitous appearance in the gold slave bikini burnt 70s feminism to the ground, and women's empowerment had to start from scratch in the sci-fi world.

The prequel trilogy started out well with Padme — a young Queen who is a political prodigy of sorts — but her badassery fizzled out as soon as the franchise turned her into the swooning love interest of the unstable Anakin Skywalker, and one who dies for literally no good reason (except of course, the screenwriter's convenience).

The latest instalment of Star Wars, however, made us fangirls spontaneously explode with happiness like a destroyed death star. Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is feminist and it doesn’t even try to make a radical statement while at it.

Not only the lead roles, but even some minor aspects of the film proved that the fantasy and sci-fi world doesn’t necessarily need to be an exclusive boy’s club. This film is definitely a win in terms of progress and gender equality, and here are some reasons why we simply loved it and urge everyone to watch it.

Careful for spoilers, if you haven’t seen the film yet.

The protagonist is female, and a total badass.

Star War’s newest Jedi, Rey, is a girl who is a survivor, who can hold her own in battle, and be a total badass while at it. She isn’t a silent bystander, who needs rescuing at the hilt of the fight when the antagonist is delivering the final blow. She is an active participant in the fight who makes the audience experience the intensity and tension she is going through.

She is also, by no means, a damsel in distress, and her gender is secondary to her storyline and character. Even incidental, some would say, as her being female is of no significance or importance to her overall character development in the film. She is simply a better warrior, a skilled pilot, and scavenger who just happens to be a woman. Additionally, nowhere in the film is she sexualised, and her attire throughout resembles the

He noted that humans from humid, warm climates have wider, shorter noses than humans from colder, dryer climates who have more narrow, longer noses. He carried on his observation postulating that the shape of the nose was influenced by the climate. The shape of a nose, a structure meant to humidify air and warm it, aside from assist in smell was more determined by climate than any other factor. Thomson’s Nose Rule, as it is known now, is taught in many biological anthropology courses. No one however has studied the how and why… Until recently.

A PLOS Genetics study published yesterday affirms that Thomson was actually sniffing up that exact pole. The authors primarily looked to understand how human variation arose. Arslan Zaidi, a postdoctoral fellow in Penn State’s department of biology and the lead author asks,

“…why do we look different from one another? Why do males and females look different? Why are there differences among humans from different populations? We focused on the nose because there is a huge body of work suggesting that it may have evolved in response to climate.”

The team focused on South Asian, East Asian, West African and Northern European ancestries. They used 3D facial imaging and examined the width of the nostrils, the distance between nostrils, the height of the nose, nose ridge length, nose protrusion, external area of the nose, and the area of the nostrils.

Then they asked two questions,

Are there variations in nose shape within the expectations of genetic drift or more varied? If more varied, can climate be an influence?

They were able to identify a positive correlation between nostril width and temperature and humidity. This implies there is a selective force in the evolution of the human nose. In fact the researchers state it is the most influential factor to the size and shape of noses we see; validating Thompson’s theory.

What about culture? With an equal distribution of males to females in the four regions why do males tend to have larger noses than females (Fig 2, below). Does this variation occur because humans prefer mates with smaller or larger noses… A element of sexual selection.

I certainly think cultural concepts of beauty may be related to how well-adapted a nose is to the local climate. But paper implies the selective pressure of climate outweighs that of culture. So why then are female noses smaller than males of the same climate, when adjusted for differences of

In the face of a serious population decline, the country hasn't got a clue when it comes to online dating.

According to a 2012 report by Japan's National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, the number of Japanese people will fall from 127 million to around 87 million by 2060.

To add to that, a 2014 survey by the Japan Family Planning Association found that 49% of all respondents had not had sex in the past month, and 18% of men said they had no interest in sex at all. "The Japanese are legitimately worried about running out of Japanese people," comedian Aziz Ansari writes in his new book, "Modern Romance," co-authored by sociologist Eric Klinenberg.

Ansari notes that Japanese culture and the fear of being perceived as "charai" (or "a sleazy player") may explain why online dating hasn't exploded in Japan.

He also cites a problem with profile photos: "In Japan, posting any pictures of yourself, especially selfie-style photos, comes off as really douchey."

"The Japanese feel like [selfies are] so narcissistic," a 29-year-old Japanese woman named Kana told the comedian-turned-author. So instead, they use photos with two or more people, or no people at all. Kana mentioned that a lot of people just post photos of their cats, or, oddly, a rice cooker.

According to one Japanese woman, it's not uncommon to see a photo of a rice cooker on someone's online dating profile. Flickr/micropig

But peculiar profile pictures aren't the only reason online dating is floundering in Japan.

As a recent Fast Company article points out, many Japanese still view online dating as a scam. That perception dates back to the '90s, when pseudo dating sites required men to pay per message and had their employees pose as female subscribers.

And in present day, scam sites prevail. This past June, The Daily Mail reported that eight executives were arrested in Japan after allegedly fake dating sites they created in 2004 were exposed. As in the '90s, the executives allegedly paid their male employees to act as women and required subscribers to pay money to talk to the "girls."

Out of the 2.7 million members on the site, only one was female

In an unscientific (but revealing) experiment launched on Friday, Tumblr user Claire Boniface announced that whenever she received a compliment from a male stranger online, she’d agree with him rather than simply ignore the comment or accept it with a gracious “thank you.”

Like many other girls and women online, Boniface was sick of getting criticized by strangers who complimented her photos and then expected a conversation in return.

“If a guy messages me I usually don’t reply because most of the time they are complete strangers to me,” 18-year-old Gweneth Bateman, a British teenager who undertook the Tumblr-based social experiment, told BuzzFeed News. “When they don’t get a reply out of me it usually ends up with them calling me ‘rude’ or a ‘bitch.’ ”

So Bateman flipped the table, responding to texts about her “gorgeous eyes” with affirmations such as “Thank you, I know.” As predicted, the men on the other side of the screen failed the experiment miserably, berating her for her confidence and then retracting the compliment altogether. Bateman cites it as an example of the way men are uncomfortable “when women own their own awesomeness.”

In part two of the experiment, posted to her Twitter account Tuesday, Bateman said she received an equally hateful reaction from men even when she politely agreed with them. The experiment has called attention to the way women’s behavior is judged by different standards from men’s. “If you reject a compliment you’re ‘attention seeking’ but if you accept it you’re ‘vain’ so [you] really can’t win either way,” she tweeted Monday.

Bateman and Boniface weren’t the only women who recently went to great lengths to give men a taste of their own privilege. In November of last year, New York–based labor organizer Beth Breslaw decided that rather than intuitively moving out of the way for people in her path, she’d take a more masculine approach and continue walking, with no regard for other pedestrians.

She got the idea from a friend who initiated the experiment after hearing that men were less likely than women to make room for others on a crowded street. The experiment was not only startling

A new report by Eustat reveals some interesting details about the state of the genders within the European Union. Women are more educated, more active, and healthier than men, all the while receiving smaller salaries.

Quality and trajectory of the lives of both sexes

On average, women leave the family home at age 25, while men do it two years later. The average European of the fairer sex lives to the age of 83, 6 years longer than men. Women are also 7 times likely to be single parents than men. That could be attributed to the European custody laws that favor women and the higher mortality rate of men. Despite that, males are more likely to be satisfied with their own health.

The two genders at work

On paper, women should be more qualified to hold higher professional positions, as 33% of them have higher education in comparison to 29% of men. However, males in management get 16% more money than their female counterparts and double them in quantity. Latvia has the largest percentage of female managers, at 47%, while Luxemburg has the lowest at 17%

Relaxation on Mars vs. Socializing on Venus

Women spend more time and money on more social leisure, like going to the theatre, the cinema, or to cultural sites. Women are also more likely to read books – 42% compared to men’s 31%. Men will use the Internet more, with 81% of them using it at least once a week compared to 77% in females.

Unsurprisingly, women are more likely to do house chores and care for children. 91% of females age 25-49 watched over their kids in comparison to 68% of males in the same age group.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Energy development is the field of activities focused on obtaining sources of energy from natural resources. These activities include production of conventional, alternative and renewable sources of energy, and for the recovery and reuse of energy that would otherwise be wasted. Energy conservation and efficiency measures reduce the demand for energy development, and can have benefits to society with improvements to environmental issues.

Societies use energy for transportation, manufacturing, illumination, heating and air conditioning, and communication, for industrial, commercial, and domestic purposes. Energy resources may be classified as primary resources, where the resource can be used in substantially its original form, or as secondary resources, where the energy source must be converted into a more conveniently usable form. Non-renewable resources are significantly depleted by human use, whereas renewable resources are produced by ongoing processes that can sustain indefinite human exploitation.

Thousands of people are employed in the energy industry. The conventional industry comprises the petroleum industry, the natural gas industry, the electrical power industry, and the nuclear industry. New energy industries include the renewable energy industry, comprising alternative and sustainable manufacture, distribution, and sale of alternative fuels.

Classification of resources [ edit ]

Open System Model (basics)

Energy resources may be classified as primary resources, suitable for end use without conversion to another form, or secondary resources, where the usable form of energy required substantial conversion from a primary source. Examples of primary energy resources are wind power, solar power, wood fuel, fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, and uranium. Secondary resources are those such as electricity, hydrogen, or other synthetic fuels.

Another important classification is based on the time required to regenerate an energy resource. "Renewable" resources are those that recover their capacity in a time significant by human needs. Examples are hydroelectric power or wind power, when the natural phenomena that are the primary source of energy are ongoing and not depleted by human demands. Non-renewable resources are those that are significantly depleted by human usage and that will not recover their potential significantly during human lifetimes. An example of a non-renewable energy source is coal, which does not form naturally at a rate that would support human use.

Fossil fuels [ edit ]

Fossil fuel (primary non-renewable fossil) sources burn coal or hydrocarbon fuels, which are the remains of the decomposition of plants and animals. There are three main types of fossil fuels: coal, petroleum, and natural gas. Another fossil fuel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), is principally derived from the production of natural gas. Heat

<|begin_of_text|>LONDON — The first thought that struck me about the Serpentine Gallery’s exhibition of Swedish artist Hilma af Klint, Painting the Unseen, was: Thank goodness — finally a solo show starring a female artist! And not just any female artist: Hilma af Klint is a brilliant choice. Few people beyond the art world have heard of her, and the work on view here proves that she was such an intriguing individual and artist, this show is so much more than the product of tokenism.

Upon entering, you’re greeted with enormous, geometric murals in flat blocks of color, instantly recognizable as in some way spiritual, even occult. Glance at the date and you see that af Klint effectively ventured into the principles of abstraction well before its more famous exponents (Kandinsky, Mondrian, and Malevich), something the publicity material takes pains to emphasize. Even more fascinating is that the abstract works here were apparently made secretively, withheld from exhibition at her own instruction for 20 years after her death.

Af Klint was trained in portrait, landscape, and botanical painting at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, Stockholm, from 1882 to 1887. From the late 1880s on, however, she rejected these disciplines, joining four other female artists to form the group De Fem (The Five), which conducted weekly séances and engaged with esoteric religious philosophies.

This side of her work — presented here as the primary side, the academic pieces completely discarded — was thus wholly rooted in spiritual concerns. She used painting as a medium (pun intended) through which the secret language of nature, whether cosmic or earthly, could be manifested, as well as early experimentations with automatic drawing. This may be the crux for understanding why her art has for so long been ignored: The level of finish (or distinct lack thereof) evidenced in the works, combined with a penchant for unplanned, experimental sequences including meandering lines and automatic drawing, indicates that the physical paintings, for af Klint, really were planes on which she communicated with immaterial and spiritual forces. They are far removed from the traditional, Western notion of not only representative art, but also, crucially, anti-representational art. In a way, to mention her work in the same breath as any of the Modernist abstraction movements is misleading, undermining real efforts to understand her real purpose.

Af Klint’s paintings appear as a series of sequences, in which one visual theme is explored in limited but specific directions

It took Lily Madigan four years to muster the courage to tell her family, her friends, and her school that she identifies as female. It took another two months for her to arrive at the school gates finally dressed in the uniform that fits with who she is. In March, Madigan, who was in the lower sixth, made her way to St Simon Stock Catholic School – a state-funded academy ­– in Maidstone, Kent, in the blouse that the other girls wear. What happened next was not what she expected. And so, last week, six months after that day, Madigan, 18, contacted BuzzFeed News to reveal what she encountered and what it means to hope for liberation and understanding only to find the opposite. Madigan was nervous that morning as she got ready for school, she said. Her voice is soft; she mostly speaks in short sentences. Despite the nerves, she added, “it just felt right”. And, in any case, “it was a lot easier than wearing a boy’s uniform”. She felt sure the school would accommodate her decision: “I didn’t think it would be a problem; I assumed they would know their obligations.”

Facebook / Lily Madigan

Shortly after entering the school premises, Mr Williams, the head of sixth form, saw Madigan. “I was pulled over for my uniform,” she said. He took her to his office. “He said my dress code was incorrect. I said I identify as female, so this is the correct dress code for me.” Boys at the school’s sixth form have to wear a shirt, tie, blazer, and trousers. Girls can wear a skirt or trousers. Williams brought in Madigan’s “pastoral manager” to discuss the situation. St Simon Stock school's website says it “prides itself on the quality of its pastoral delivery”. The conclusion of this discussion was clear: “They said I was breaking the dress code and I had to go home. At that point I was pretty panicky,” Madigan said. This anxiety began to rise; she did not feel able to respond, and anyway, she added, she doesn’t like confrontation. “I just went.” At 14, Madigan realised who she was. “It’s always something I knew subconsciously,” she said, “but when I learned the term [transgender] it just clicked.” She eventually told her mother, over dinner, and then in January this year she told her friends at school.

<|begin_of_text|>Explaining the evolution of cooperation among non-relatives is one of the major challenges for evolutionary biology. In this study, we experimentally examined human cooperation in the iterated Snowdrift game (ISD), which has received little attention so far, and compared it with human cooperation in the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD), which has become the paradigm for the evolution of cooperation. We show that iteration in the ISD leads to consistently higher levels of cooperation than in the IPD. We further demonstrate that the most successful strategies known for the IPD (generous Tit-for-Tat and Pavlov) were also successfully used in the ISD. Interestingly, we found that female players cooperated significantly more often than male players in the IPD but not in the ISD. Moreover, female players in the IPD applied Tit-for-Tat-like or Pavlovian strategies significantly more often than male players, thereby achieving significantly higher pay-offs than male players did. These data demonstrate that the willingness to cooperate does not only depend on the type of the social dilemma, but also on the class of individuals involved. Altogether, our study shows that the ISD can potentially explain high levels of cooperation among non-relatives in humans. In addition, the ISD seems to reflect the social dilemma more realistically than the IPD because individuals obtain immediate direct benefits from the cooperative acts they perform and costs of cooperation are shared between cooperators.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Fetal sex tests have a few medical applications, allowing couples with histories of rare sex-linked disorders to avoid costly and invasive genetic testing if they learn they are expecting the other sex. But for most couples, the tests, which are unregulated, simply answer the boy-or-girl question weeks earlier than ultrasound, and in a less invasive and safer way than amniocentesis.

“Seven weeks is a different time in pregnancy,” said Dr. James Egan, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Connecticut Health Center who was a co-author of a study on sex selection with Dr. Chapman and others. “Women haven’t had the ultrasound where you see the fetus that looks like a baby. Many people don’t even know that a woman is pregnant. And you can have a medical termination,” using pills like RU-486, which can be used at home discreetly before 10 weeks of pregnancy.

There is evidence that some Americans want to choose their babies’ sex. At the Fertility Institutes, a set of clinics in Los Angeles, New York and Guadalajara, Mexico, 85 percent of roughly 500 couples each year seek sex selection, although three-quarters of them come from overseas, said Dr. Jeffrey Steinberg, the medical director.

“It’s jumped over the past four years,” said Dr. Steinberg, whose clinics determine sex through pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, an embryo screening that also detects genetic disorders. He said that “if a woman calls to make the appointment, the couple almost always wants a female. If a man calls, they almost always want a male.”

But clinics and some ethicists say this type of sex selection is more acceptable because it occurs before embryos are implanted, before pregnancy.

“We’re trying to prevent the abortion,” said Dr. Jamie Grifo, program director for New York University’s Fertility Center. His and other clinics typically allow sex selection for couples with two or more children, parents interested in “family balancing,” adding a child of the opposite sex.

“For someone who has two girls and wants to have a boy, so each sibling can grow up with brother and sister, what’s wrong with that?” Dr. Grifo said.

Still, the cost and commitment of the fertility process makes such sex selection cases relatively unusual. Fetal DNA tests, costing between $250 and $350, are more affordable.

Anti-abortion groups are incorporating sex selection in legislative agendas. Arizona and Oklahoma recently passed laws banning sex-selected abortion

<|begin_of_text|>New Delhi (CNN) — Air India, a debt-burdened, state-run carrier, is trying to shed some extra flab.

The airline has asked 125 of its flight attendants to lose a few pounds or get ready for an airport job.

l e v a r t

"It is an opportunity for them to bring themselves back to the (required) fitness level. If they cannot because of any medical reasons, they will be offered ground duties," Air India spokesman G.P. Rao told CNN Tuesday.

The decision follows fitness guidelines laid out by India's civil aviation regulator.

Last year, the regulator mandated a body mass index (BMI) of 18-25 for male cabin crew members and 18-22 for female cabin crew members. Men with a BMI of 25-29.99, and women with a BMI of 22-27, were classified as overweight.

'Safety issue'

Some say the index, which is determined by a person's height-to-weight ratio, is not always an accurate indicator of someone's health and body fat percentage.

But the airline insists the move to manage its employees' physique is not about appearances.

"It's a safety issue," Rao said. "The crew has to be fit to be able to carry out their inflight duties, including emergencies."

Rao, however, didn't say how much time the shortlisted 125-odd crew would have to slim down.

He added this is not the first time Air India has advised its flight attendants to stay "fit."

l e v a r t

"This is an ongoing process. We have been doing this exercise for quite some time," he said.

Air India currently employs more than 3,000 cabin crew members. According to a Times of India report, a "large number" of the employees refused to undergo medical examinations for their BMI as ordered by the company back in 2013. Instead, they asked the airline to first pay for gym memberships before conducting any lab tests, the report said.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>We’re all getting fatter, but Irish men are getting fatter fastest. The prognosis is poor: by 2030, 58 per cent of Irish men are expected to be obese, topping the scale of all European countries, according to a UK-based study published last year. If you add the projected number of overweight men to the Irish total, the figure is even worse, coming in at a gut-busting 90 per cent.

Now a new review of men’s food behaviour by Safefood, the all-Ireland health body, shows that we’re well on our way to fulfilling that frightening prediction. It points out that 70 per cent of men in the Republic are currently overweight or obese, compared with 50 per cent of women, as are 69 per cent of men in the North, against 57 per cent of women.

The big question, of course, is why. What is it about living on this island that makes Irish men, in particular, stuff themselves silly, with so little regard for the health consequences?

Many reasons – from simple greed or laziness, to more complex speculations about how men respond to stress, or marriage, or whether they are especially sensitive to the effects of chemicals such as phthalates, commonly found in household products – have been forwarded for male weight gain.

Dr Aileen McGloin, from Safefood, has a list of contributing factors as long as your arm, all of which, it seems, can be summed up by one single sentence. “Men,” she says, “live in a different food world.”

A different food world? Hang on, don’t we all occupy the same universe of choices, populated by temptations like fat-laden ready-meals and sneaky snacks under the desk at work? But McGloin says that men’s experience of eating, and all that goes with it – the shopping, the preparation, the amount they actually consume – is often markedly different to how women encounter their food.

Men are more likely to eat larger portions, they’re less likely to be aware of healthy eating guidelines, and many don’t regard eating well as an important factor in their long-term health.

Is it just about complacency then? Even ignorance? McGloin isn’t keen to be so judgmental. Rather, she says, it’s a matter of cultural conditioning, right from the start.

“You have to be careful about over-generalising, but men are less likely to learn about food in childhood, so they sometimes come into adulthood without

<|begin_of_text|>A Haines teenager was likely the first transgender student to compete at a statewide high school athletic competition. Nattaphon Wangyot was born male, but has identified as female since she was about five years old. Her participation in last weekend’s track meet in Anchorage drew a lot of attention, both positive and negative.

Wangyot goes by the nickname ‘Ice.’ Her mother, Tukta Panyawong, said the nickname comes from when she was pregnant with Ice, back in Thailand, and she used to chew on ice cubes.

Panyawong said the nickname fits, especially in the aftermath of the track meet. She says her daughter has been cool under pressure.

“You know, if some people say bad to you and you do bad to them, it’s not going to end easy,” Ice said. “So if they say bad to you, just smile at them and let it go.”

There’s a lot Ice has to let go. She’s read comments from news stories about the track competition. Some are supportive and positive, but Ice says others are ‘hateful.’ But, she says, the hateful comments make her stronger.

“Some hateful people make me stronger and stronger,” Ice said. “So I want to say ‘thank you’ for everybody.”

It isn’t just online commentators who have a problem with Ice competing against other girls. On Friday, the conservative Christian group Alaska Family Action held a press conference.

“It is not fair and it is not right for our female athletes, and we have a responsibility to protect our girls,” said Stephanie Leigh Golmon Williams, as reported by KTVA.

The group said male-to-female transgender students have an advantage over biologically female athletes. Ice disagrees. She says she takes medication that suppresses male hormones and increases female hormones.

Alaska Family Action was protesting the Alaska School Activities Association’s recently adopted policy on transgender athletes. The policy lets local schools decide whether transgender students can compete according to the gender they identify with.

“The bigger gist of how this policy was developed is ASAA feels that schools are in the best position of dealing with individual students and know which individual students consistently identify with a different gender and can apply that better than we can, thousands of miles away from the actual student,” said ASAA director Billy Strickland.

“Yeah, we’re not gonna discriminate based on gender identity. That’s the just the long and the short of it,” said Haines School District Interim Superintendent Rich Carlson.

<|begin_of_text|>When black teachers and white teachers are asked to sum up black high school students' potential, white teachers are much less likely to see black students as college material. And that's true even when they're discussing the same students.

A new study exploring how race influences teachers' perception of their students' abilities found that those expectations are racially biased.

When teachers are asked about their expectations for black students, nonblack teachers were 30 percent less likely than black teachers to say they thought those students would earn a college degree.

The implications are troubling, in part because the majority of public school students in the US are nonwhite but the majority of teachers are not.

How racial bias influences teachers' expectations

On average, black students have lower test scores than white students, they attend schools with fewer resources, and they are less likely to graduate from high school and college. Assuming that will continue to be the case is what President George W. Bush called "the soft bigotry of low expectations."

But Bush was usually talking about collective expectations. The researchers in the new study, published as a working paper by the Upjohn Institute, which specializes in employment research, didn't compare teachers' broad expectations for their black students with their expectations of white students. It looked at how teachers of different races perceived the potential of the same student — where race, theoretically, shouldn't make as much of a difference.

In 2002, as part of a study that followed high school sophomores through the educational system, the Education Department asked those students' math and reading teachers if they expected them to eventually earn a high school or college degree.

The researchers, Seth Gershenson, Stephen B. Holt, and Nicholas Papageorge, looked at how those expectations differed based on whether the teachers were the same race or sex as their student, using a data set of about 16,000 students. They found that teachers' expectations for their white students didn't differ based on the teachers' race, but that black teachers' expectations were significantly higher for their black students than white teachers' expectations were.

The differences were even larger when the teachers were of both a different sex and race than their students — particularly for white female teachers evaluating black male students.

"We cannot determine whether the black teachers are too optimistic, the non-black teachers are too pessimistic, or some combination of the two," Gershenson wrote in a blog post at the Brookings Institution. "This is nonetheless concerning, as teachers’ expectations likely shape student outcomes."

<|begin_of_text|>I am not completely sure about this but I would like to share my opinion. Through my travels to this wonderful nation, I had the opportunity to visit cities like Xian, Tianjin, Beijing, Shenzhen, Suzhou, Shanghai and Harbin.

A common observation that stood out in these visits was that the Chinese women were generally more interested and engaged in continuing a conversation. The young women also seemed to show interest in knowing more about my background, where I was from and what made me come to China. It was probably because it was rare for them to see an Indian national in cities like Xian and Tianjin.

Also, I noticed that most occupations which involved speaking and other customer service related jobs were primarily held by women. Every local restaurant I visited, the orders were always taken by the women while the men were involved with the cleaning, setting up tables and other tasks.

Based on these experiences, I feel Chinese women are culturally more outgoing and more comfortable with speaking to people from different backgrounds. Additionally, during my graduate study at Northwestern, all the male students from Mainland China were much more reserved than the female graduate students.

There were would be several other dynamics and factors involved, but I agree with the question and feel it might be easier for women from Mainland China to adapt quicker. This might vary between individuals and may not be true for older Chinese people (the dynamics may be reversed for higher age groups).<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

There are comic strips to accompany some of these that I will get posted in the coming weeks. * NEVER: Network to Eliminate Vaginally Elitist Rabble. Slogan: It's NOW or NEVER! In the 1990s feminist marches focused almost exclusively on male violence against women (while utterlying ignoring female violence against men and children and elders and other women). As the number of studies have increased that show male violence against women is not nearly as bad a problem as the feminists would have us believe, and that female violence is far more prevalent than they would have us believe, their protests have shifted emphasis to blame the "slut shaming" women do to one another on men, and to basically protest everything with naked displays that amuse and entertain most men but irritate and anger most women.

<|begin_of_text|>There’s an enduring popular image of divorced women as bitter and jaded, while divorced men are portrayed as all too happy to break free. But this proves wrong when put to the test.

Women love four things, according to hack comedians and romantic comedies: chocolate, shopping, nagging dudes like it’s their job, and marriage. On that last count, we’re told, love rises to the level of obsession: Women long to be brides their whole lives and then cling to their marriages when they become wives. But new studies suggest women are less happy in mediocre heterosexual marriages, more likely to call things off and more content with post-divorce life than men. Taken together, the findings debunk a lot of long-held—and outdated—gendered ideas about one of our oldest institutions.

Women and men are equally likely to end non-married intimate relationships, including when the couple lives together. That all changes once vows are exchanged. A 2015 study involving more than 2,000 heterosexual married couples aged 19 to 94 found that women initiate divorce in nearly 70 percent of marriages. Researchers theorize this might be a result of gender norms that make heterosexual marriage an unequal partnership, with women getting the short end of the stick. We know that married couples divide housework evenly until they have a child, after which the woman takes on the bulk of childcare and housework loads shift disproportionately to her.

Marriage does a better job for men of improving health outcomes, decreasing chronic illnesses, and extending life spans, than it does for women. Married men make more money than their unmarried male counterparts, but there’s no such income bump for married women. In fact, researchers note that post-marriage, women’s “earnings and careers are thought to suffer.” This might contribute to the reasons why, as study author Michael Rosenfeld of Stanford University told Science Daily, “Women seem to have a predominant role in initiating divorces in the U.S. as far back as there is data from a variety of sources, back to the 1940s.”

“I think that marriage as an institution has been a little bit slow to catch up with expectations for gender equality,” Rosenfeld added. “Wives still take their husbands’ surnames, and are sometimes pressured to do so. Husbands still expect their wives to do the bulk of the housework and the bulk of the childcare. On the other hand, I think that non-marital relationships lack the historical baggage and expectations of marriage, which makes the non-marital

<|begin_of_text|>Most Democrats want stricter gun laws, and most Republicans oppose them. So you might expect the election of Donald Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress to be great news for the nation’s gunmakers. But surprisingly, the opposite turned out to be the case.

Two of the nation’s biggest gun manufacturers, Smith & Wesson and Sturm Ruger, saw their stock prices fall by double digits this morning in the wake of Trump’s election victory.

Here’s one theory for what’s going on: In recent years, gun sales have been driven by fears of gun confiscations. Gun sales soared after Obama’s election in 2008 and again when he was reelected in 2012, as people worried that the president would begin to confiscate the nation’s firearms.

In contrast, gun owners have little to fear from a Trump presidency or a Republican Congress. So gunmakers are likely to make fewer sales over the next four years.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Transgender women are "not women", Australian-born academic and writer Germaine Greer has said.

Her comments were made in response to a petition asking Cardiff University to cancel the author's lecture.

Ms Greer is due to speak in a lecture called Women & Power: The Lessons of the 20th Century.

Students' union women's officer Rachel Melhuish said Ms Greer's views towards transgender women are "misogynistic".

By Friday, more than 200 people had signed an online petition calling for the university not to host the lecture, which is an annual event in memory of former deputy vice-chancellor Hadyn Ellis, who died in 2006.

'Hateful comments'

Ms Greer told BBC News: "I was going to talk about women and power... because I think there is a lot of triumphalist talk that masks the real historic situation.

"And apparently people have decided that because I don't think that post-operative transgender men... are women I'm not to be allowed to talk."

She also claimed that "a great many women" who are not transgender think transgender women - who she refers to as "male to female transgender people" - do not "look like, sound like or behave like women".

Ms Greer did say she would be prepared to use female pronouns when referring to someone, if that was their preference, "as a courtesy".

On Friday, the university's vice-chancellor Prof Colin Riordan said it does not condone "discriminatory comments of any kind".

"At Cardiff University we work hard to provide a positive and welcoming space for LGBT+ people and we are in consultation with student and staff groups to ensure that the views of LGBT+ people are represented at our events", he said.

While the statement on the petition web page does not cite examples of Ms Greer's alleged anti-transgender views, it accuses her of "continually misgendering trans women and denying the existence of transphobia altogether".<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

A report from the National Human Trafficking Hotline showed which country they were most likely to be found in 2016--the United States.

It also found that 58 percent of male trafficking victims were used for forced labor, in industries spanning from agriculture and forestry to hotels and restaurants.

But, Ashley Cruz at the Rape Crisis Center told ABC15 that getting men to speak out about their situations like trafficking, domestic violence, or sexual assault is harder, even if she and her staff have resources available specifically for them.

"You have to be strong, you have to be aggressive, you can't fall victim to manipulation, coercion, or just straight fear. It's not allowed for males," Cruz said, while telling us that world-wide, 45 percent of all trafficking victims are male.

Cruz introduced us to her husband, a Brazilian jujitsu fighter and teacher. The couple helped a friend of the husband's after the friend was brought to the US to teach jujitsu classes, and never paid the money he was promised.

"The salary never came, and he was never put in a better place to sleep. He was taking showers in other gyms," Elton Hoshihara Cruz recalled.

He said human trafficking is common in the Brazilian jujitsu industry.

Ashley Cruz said human trafficking is on the rise for both men and women, explaining that it's on pace to overtake the drug trafficking industry within 5 years.

If you are a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or human trafficking and need help, please call the Rape Crisis Center at 843-448-7273 (Horry County) or 843-545-5198 (Georgetown County).

<|begin_of_text|>We’ve all heard about the gender gap in tech. Women simply aren’t thriving in one of the most promising fields in the United States — and not for lack of talent. And here’s the truth: It’s not solely a problem for women. It’s a problem for men, too. In just five years, there will be a million unfilled computer science–related jobs in the United States, which according to our calculations could amount to a $500 billion opportunity cost. Tech companies are producing jobs three times faster than the U.S. is producing computer scientists. There are incredible opportunities here. We need women to help fill these jobs, and we need them now.

The reasons why women and people of color are not pursuing computer science jobs are complicated. I’ve thought a lot about this over the past 16 months, as I’ve directed my documentary on the subject, Code: Debugging the Gender Gap, and I believe there are four main reasons women don’t thrive in tech. Here they are:

1. Culture

First and foremost, this is a culture problem. The stereotype of a software engineer is a 25-year-old, hoodie-clad dude who wears glasses, is antisocial, and loves to hack strings of code in the basement of his parents’ home, eating stale pizza and drinking Red Bull until 3 or 4am. As with all stereotypes, there’s some truth here, and it’s not the most aspirational image for a young woman. Old movies like War Games contributed to the stereotype, while the image of the male geek genius is perpetuated in modern pop culture with television shows such as HBO’s Silicon Valley and The Big Bang Theory.

2. Few role models

Which leads me to another huge reason we have a gender imbalance: Tech is basically devoid of female role models. The old adage “You cannot be what you cannot see” is true here. Young girls and people of color have very few modern-day role models in tech. Megan Smith is the Chief Technology Officer of the United States, but she’s hardly a household name. We need more modern-day female role models, many more.

3. Poor pipeline

At most universities, few women make it past the 101, entry-level computer science class that should welcome all students, regardless of their prior knowledge of the subject. Instead, women entering this first-year class too often suffer from negative ambient belonging. From the first day there, they perceive that the men in the class know much more about programming than they do. And they are

<|begin_of_text|>Previous studies have shown that men find female faces more attractive when the women are ovulating, but the visual clues that allow this are unclear. Now, new research investigating whether it might be to do with subtle changes in skin colour has shown that women’s faces do increase in redness during ovulation, but the levels of change are just under the detectable range of the human eye.

Researchers say this may mean that facial redness in females was once an involuntary signal for optimal fertility, but has since been “dampened” by evolution as it is more beneficial for females to hide or control outward signs of peak fertility.

Involuntarily signalling ovulation can prevent longer-term investment from males. In primate species that advertise ovulation, males only express sexual interest in females when they appear to be fertile. In humans, ovulation is less conspicuous and sexual behaviour is not restricted to the period of peak fertility.

The research, published today in the open-access journal PLOS ONE, is the most complete objective study of female faces during the ovulatory cycle, say researchers. Twenty-two women were photographed without make-up at the same time every working day for at least one month in the same environment and using a scientific camera modified to more accurately capture colour (usually used for studying camouflage in wildlife).

A computer programme was designed to select an identical patch of cheek from each photograph. The participants also self-tested for hormone changes at key times dictated by the research team’s “period maths”.

A surge in luteinising hormone told researchers that ovulation would occur in roughly the next 24 hours, so they knew which photographs were taken when the women were most fertile. The team converted the imagery into red/green/blue (RGB) values to measure colour levels and changes.

They found that redness varied significantly across the ovulatory cycle, peaking at ovulation and remaining high during the latter stages of the cycle after oestrogen levels have fallen. Skin redness then dips considerably once menstruation begins. The research suggests facial redness closely maps fluctuations in body temperature during the cycle.

However, when running the results through models of human visual perception, the average difference in redness was 0.6 units. A change of 2.2 units are needed to be detectable to the naked human eye.

“Women don’t advertise ovulation, but they do seem to leak information about it, as studies have shown they are seen as more attractive by men when ovulating,” said Dr Hannah Rowland, from the University of Cambridge’s Zo

When Elsie Inglis asked the War Office if female doctors and surgeons could serve in front-line hospitals in World War One she was told'my good lady, go home and sit still'.

Elsie, a pioneering Edinburgh doctor who had already become well-known as a champion of women's health, did the opposite.

Instead, she formed the Scottish Women's Hospitals - all female units that provided support for Britain's allies, the French, the Belgians and especially the Serbs.

Elsie was 50 when war broke out and had already made a mark in Edinburgh by working with women and babies in the poorest parts of the city.

Image caption War medals belonging to Dr Inglis have been displayed in Edinburgh

She was also a prominent campaigner for votes for women and it was through the suffrage movement that she began to raise money to send out female doctors, nurses, orderlies and drivers to the front line.

Elsie raised the equivalent of £53m in today's money and over the course of the war set up 14 hospitals, staffed by 1,500 women who volunteered from all over Scotland, and later from New Zealand, Australia and Canada.

These woman were often unmarried and wanted to prove their independence and capability on the front line.

They worked in dire conditions to treat hundreds of thousands of injured men during the bloody conflict.

'Horrendous conditions'

Within months of the outbreak of war she had started a hospital in the north of France and field hospitals were set up close to battlefields across Europe including, in particular, Serbia.

Writer and researcher Louise Miller said the Balkan country was devastated by the war when, as well as being invaded, it was gripped by a typhus epidemic. In total, it lost about 16% of its population.

"Serbs needed any competent help they could get. They didn't care about the form it took: male, female, young, old - anybody," she said.

The first Scottish Women's Hospital field unit was formed in December 1914 in a town called Kragujevac in Serbia.

According to historian Alan Cumming, who has done much to resurrect Elsie's memory, the conditions were "horrendous".

<|begin_of_text|>Prostitutes are penis experts. There is no other group of professionals – not scientists, not academic researchers, not journalists – that have more experience viewing and handling a large number and wide variety of penises. Additionally, prostitutes are probably the only professional group qualified to comment on how penises of differing sizes and shapes feel when they are inside a woman.

It seems like every month another article about the latest penis size study is published. It’s a popular media topic because men are becoming increasingly obsessed with the size of their genitals, thanks in part to the wide availability of online porn showing women writhing in pleasure as they receive a plunging from one large penis after another.

There is a lot of speculation about what the perfect penis is supposed to look like, how long or wide it needs to be in order to deliver pleasure, and what’s considered “ideal.” I decided to share my informed opinion as a licensed Nevada prostitute and write about certain myths that many people tend to believe, either due to lack of sexual experience or a limited exposure to all of the various penis shapes and sizes. Below are what I consider to be the three most common myths about penis size.

Myth #1: There is such a thing as an “ideal” penis size

I’ve seen a lot of cocks. They come in all shapes, lengths, widths, and colors. Some bend upwards, some downwards, some curve to the side. Some are almost the size of my forearm, some the size of my thumb. I’ve seen penises with a sharp bend like a water faucet, and penises shaped like a mushroom, with a large head on a smaller shaft. While some online resources will try to trick people into believing that there is such a thing as an “ideal penis,” I’m here to tell you that as long as your penis is healthy, it’s ideal for sex and is capable of pleasing a woman.

There are so many ways that one healthy penis can differ from the next, that it’s pointless to try to figure out what’s “normal” or “ideal.” Sure, you can go on Wikipedia, read that the average penis length is 5.17 inches, get an idea as to how you measure up against this average, and feel better (or worse) about yourself. But comparing yourself to a statistical average or striving for an ideal will not only give you a false perception of the wonderful diversity of healthy penises, but also impair your ability to see yourself as a valuable individual who uses your unique body to be the best

<|begin_of_text|>Image caption Despite having the same qualifications as men, recent women graduates earn less, suggests a study

Female graduates earn thousands of pounds less than their male counterparts, according to a report.

The pay gap persists even between men and women from the same types of university who studied the same subjects, suggests the study.

Researchers for the Higher Education Careers Services Unit (Hecsu) analysed how much students who applied to higher education in 2006, earned last year.

Jane Artess, of Hecsu, said pay distribution was "strikingly uneven".

This was despite laws designed to ensure equal access to jobs and pay, said Ms Artess,

The researchers analysed data from a longitudinal study of 17,000 recent graduates called Futuretrack. They found that the take-home pay of more than half of female graduates ranged between £15,000 and £23,999.

Male lead

Men were more likely to take home £24,000 and above, they found.

The analysis did not include part-time workers or the unemployed.

The data, published in the Hecsu journal Graduate Market Trends, suggested men earned more than women across all degree subject areas, even if more women took those subjects than men.

"When graduate earnings are examined by subject, it is clear that women earned less than men who studied the same subject," says the article.

The authors add this is the case across all subject areas, "even where women's participation is greater than men's".

"Equal opportunity to access jobs and pay has been enshrined in legislation for 40 years, yet Futuretrack found that being female can make a difference to a graduate's earning power", said Ms Artess.

"It is difficult to see why this is, for example, female graduates of media-related subjects are no more or less numerous than their male counterparts yet their earnings are typically lower.

"Of the Futuretrack respondents, there were fewer men than women in law, yet there is an even greater male lead on earnings.

"Since it would be unlawful for employers to pay males and females doing the same job differently, something else must be happening to female graduate earnings.

"If we look at wages by sector, the male lead is persistent in the public and private sectors, in graduate workplaces and also in graduate and non-graduate job roles.

"The only area where female pay is equal to males is in the not-for-profit sector," said Ms Artess.

Trades Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O'Grady described the findings as "very alarming."

The Department for Transport has appointed two women to the civil service's first ever job share at director general level as successors to the DfT's newly appointed permanent secretary.

Polly Payne and Ruth Hannant will join the DfT as directors general for the department's Rail Group on 11 December from the Department for Education, filling the position left vacant when Bernadette Kelly was promoted to perm sec in April.

Kelly said the pair would be role models not only for the civil service but also for the rail sector, where women make up just 11% of the workforce and senior leaders are "overwhelmingly male".

She told Civil Service World: “I’m proud that the Department for Transport is leading the way with the first job share partnership at this level in government. And I’m especially pleased that we have Polly and Ruth joining us to lead our work on rail.

Kelly was DG for Rail Group from September 2015 to April 2017, when Nick Joyce took the post in an "acting" capacity.

Rail Group is responsible for developing strategy and policy for the rail sector, managing expenditure on rail services and infrastructure, and oversees the delivery of rail franchises and major projects – including Crossrail and Thameslink.

It sponsors British Transport Police, Network Rail, the Office of Rail and Road, the Rail Accidents Investigation Branch and Transport Focus.

Payne and Hannant were already in a job-share partnership with each other working on higher education reform in DfE, and have both previously worked for the former Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and theTreasury. Former BIS permanent secretary Martin Donnelly described the pair as an "outstandingly effective job share", during an interview with Civil Service World earlier this year.

DfT said the appointment demonstrated the government's commitment to increasing the number of women working in the rail sector. The Transport Infrastructure Skills Strategy, published in 2015, included an aim for women to make up 20% of DfT's science and technical apprenticeships by 2020, and 50% by 2030.

Kelly added: “Within the DfT we are making progress in encouraging diversity at every level, and earlier this year the department was recognised for our leadership on workplace gender equality by
