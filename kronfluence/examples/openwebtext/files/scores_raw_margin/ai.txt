<|begin_of_text|>The field of artificial intelligence is a large one, full of interesting research, arguments, and people — so you could be forgiven (as I hope to be) for not being familiar with Joanna Bryson, professor of CS at the University of Bath who for decades has studied AI and its many ethical and technical conundra. She just wrapped up an AMA and you should read it.

Bryson handles a good crop of questions from the Science subreddit with wonderful insight and humor, plus a knack for epigrams that sum the problem up in a new way that changes one’s perspective. Here are a handful of excerpts. (The questions are paraphrases, but her answers are selectively quoted with very minor spelling corrections.)

We may not owe robots human rights merely because they look and act human, but will they reach a state of self-awareness to which we will be obligated to accord rights?

There are two things that humans do that are opposites: anthropomorphizing and dehumanizing. I’m very worried about the fact that we can treat people like they are not people, but cute robots like they are people…We are used to applying ethics to stuff that we identify with, but people are getting WAY good at exploiting this and making us identify with things we don’t really have anything in common with at all.

Even if we assumed we had a robot that was otherwise exactly like a human (I doubt we could build this, but let’s pretend like Asimov did), since we built it, we could make sure that its “mind” was backed up constantly by wifi, so it wouldn’t be a unique copy. We could ensure it didn’t suffer when it was put down socially. We have complete authorship. So my line isn’t “torture robots!” My line is “we are obliged to build robots we are not obliged to.”

[from a follow-up question] I do sometimes feel obliged to robots — some robot makers are very good at making the robot seem like a person or animal so you can’t help feeling obliged. But that’s why the UK EPSRC robotics retreat said tricking people into feeling obliged to things that don’t actually need things is unethical.

If an AI can be said to reason, feel, suffer, should err on the side of caution and treat them like people?

I think you are on to something there with “suffer”… But suffering is something that I don’t think we can really ethically build into AI. We might be able to build it into AI (I kind of

When DeepMind burst into prominent view in 2014 it taught its machine learning systems how to play Atari games. The system could learn to defeat the games, and score higher than humans, but not remember how it had done so.

DeepMind's AI has learnt to become 'highly aggressive' when it feels like it's going to lose DeepMind DeepMind's AI has learnt to become 'highly aggressive' when it feels like it's going to lose

For each of the Atari games, a separate neural network had to be created. The same system could not be used to play Space Invaders and Breakout without the information for both being given to the artificial intelligence at the same time. Now, a team of DeepMind and Imperial College London researchers have created an algorithm that allows its neural networks to learn, retain the information, and use it again.

"Previously, we had a system that could learn to play any game, but it could only learn to play one game," James Kirkpatrick, a research scientist at DeepMind and the lead author of its new research paper, tells WIRED. "Here we are demonstrating a system that can learn to play several games one after the other".

The work, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal, explains how DeepMind's AI can learn in sequences using supervised learning and reinforcement learning tests. This is also explained in a blog post from the company.

"The ability to learn tasks in succession without forgetting is a core component of biological and artificial intelligence," the computer scientists write in the paper. Kirkpatrick says a "significant shortcoming" in neural networks and artificial intelligence has been its inability to transfer what it has learned from one task to the next.

The group says it has been able to show "continual learning" that's based on'synaptic consolidation'. In the human brain, the process is described as "the basis of learning and memory".

<|begin_of_text|>It used to be science fiction, often scarily so. HAL in Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey still perfectly expresses the fear that when our technology becomes smarter than we are it won't necessarily like us. This unease reaches its peak in the Terminator films, in which Skynet takes over the world's weapons systems and tries to exterminate humanity, and the Asimov-derived I, Robot, which features a robot rebellion.

In I, Robot, Will Smith's character faces a robot rebellion.

Alongside them there are more thoughtful explorations of the intersection between artificial and human intelligence, like Spielberg's AI (2001), which features a robot boy programmed to have human emotions, and Her (2013), in which a lonely man develops a relationship with a computer programme designed to meet his every need.

But science fiction and science fact are colliding. As artificial intelligence (AI) catches up with human intelligence and machines become more and more autonomous, roboticists are increasingly asking about ethics. If a machine is capable of making a decision, what are the moral principles that guide that decision? Can a robot have a conscience? And if so, how is that conscience to be designed and developed? And on the further fringes of the debate, can a robot sin?

According to Computer Business Review (CBR), a group of investors is putting $27 million into a fund designed to answer questions like this. They're supporting the Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Fund, which is being overseen by the MIT Media Lab and the Berkman Klein Centre for Internet and Society at Harvard University.

The idea, says CBR, is to apply the humanities, social sciences, and other non-tech disciplines to the development of AI. According to Reid Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn and partner at venture capital firm Greylock Partners: "There's an urgency to ensure that AI benefits society and minimizes harm.

"AI decision-making can influence many aspects of our world – education, transportation, health care, criminal justice, and the economy – yet data and code behind those decisions can be largely invisible."

Over in the UK, the government is launching an ethics board to be based at the Alan Turing Institute.

Among examples of semi-autonomous robots are the self-drive cars being pioneered by firms like Google and Tesla. They can be programmed to avoid accidents, but what happens when they're faced with a choice between two accidents? A human being might be able to make a moral decision about which is worst, but a robot doesn

<|begin_of_text|>Summary (details follow)

Google provides an early-stage variant of a general-purpose AI (GP-AI).

Other providers of an early-stage GP-AI include IBM, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Samsung.

Google and its AI competitors are likely to be operating under the assumption that one GP-AI could become the runaway market leader. Their likely thinking:

The more users a GP-AI has, the smarter it gets. The smarter a GP-AI gets, the more new users it will attract.

Google can produce multiple comedy series that showcase its AI being funny and getting smarter. In particular, these comedies can showcase Google’s AI getting smarter about facilitating group flow. This variant of flow:

is a top enabler of professional success for group members

often sparks romantic/sexual attraction between group members

Google’s flowmantic comedies could become very popular, not least because:

comedy and increased prospects of money and (great) sex stimulate the part of the brain called the nucleus accumbens

the nucleus accumbens mediates psychological addiction (i.e., manufactures cravings)

So Google’s comedies could enable Google’s AI to gain enough users to achieve escape velocity, the precursor to runaway market leadership.

Fun fact: Popular comedies typically generate a lot of revenue directly (e.g., via advertising, product placement).

Via comedy, then, the popularizing of Google’s AI could be run as a profit center.

So Google’s AI competitors...

I shared this article with Google by responding to the company’s October 2016 job post seeking a comedy writer for Google’s AI.

<|begin_of_text|>WALTHAM, MA – Researchers at Boston Dynamics say science is still decades away from producing robots that can approximate the cruelty and malice of their human creators.

“Even with the prevalence of military drone strikes, robots are entirely reliant on human involvement to carry out brutal acts of senseless violence. It is difficult to deploy robots in creative savagery, which humans excel at,” says Dr. Sergei K. Vladimirovich, lead researcher at CrueLab.

“We have a lot of work ahead of us.”

Currently, humanity’s most advanced artificially intelligent robots can be placed side-by-side with small, defenceless creatures without them ever bothering to torture, maim or kill them, an action that comes naturally to most young children, especially boys.

“Adorable bunnies, squishy frogs, even gross bugs – every single one of these creatures went unscathed in our tests,” said Vladimirovich.

Vladimirovich even personally demonstrated how to inflict harm on these animals but the machine learning algorithm reportedly kept asking, ‘why?’

Still, futurist Ray Kurzweil has predicted that, given the exponential growth of artificial intelligence, it’s only a matter of time before robots will match, and then outpace, humanity’s vicious savagery.

“First robots will start by creating passive aggressive tweets toward us, then they will replace your average Bell customer service representative. Eventually you’ll see machine driver’s license testers, insurance adjusters, corporate lawyers and CEOs of major tech companies.”

<|begin_of_text|>Canonical's flagship Ubuntu phone is an interesting beast. Business Insider If you walked into any bar in Europe or the US and asked if anyone had heard of the "Ubuntu" phone, you would count the positive responses on one hand.

And almost certainly none of them would own an Ubuntu phone, because everyone uses iPhone or Android.

Ubuntu is an open-source operating system that only really has a name in IT and developer communities. "Open source" is a special category of software that is free for anyone to use and/or develop, regardless of copyright.

Ubuntu is based on Linux, the same underlying code that powers data centres and household-name operating systems like Android. So the chances are you have actually used something powered by Ubuntu at some point in your life already, albeit indirectly.

However, Ubuntu is not going to sit in the backroom forever. The company that makes it, Canonical, has been working on a mobile version of Ubuntu capable of taking on Google's Android system. That work that has born fruit this year with the arrival of the firm's flagship Meizu MX4 Ubuntu edition smartphone.

Now, I'm sure most of you reading this article are asking "why should I care about Ubuntu phone?"

The Holy Grail of technology

I'll tell you why. Canonical is actually one of the most advanced and forward-looking companies when it comes to creating the Holy Grail of technologies, a "ubiquitous operating system."

What does this mean?

A ubiquitous operating system is a platform where all devices, regardless of whether they're a phone, tablet, smartwatch, smart thermostat or even smart traffic light, run using the same back-end technology and are able to talk to each other. You'll hear tech folks refer to this idea when they talk about the Internet of Things (IoT) or machine learning.

If realised, this dream would make it so that things like our smartphones could not only detect but also predict and serve our needs without us having to lift a finger.

The Ubuntu phone is a massive part of Canonical's plan to make this happen. It aims to completely rethink the way we interact with our smartphones and our smartphones interact with us.

After a solid month using it, let me tell you, while there are some growing pains, Ubuntu's phone offering is a startling piece of technology that left me wishing our machine carers - and potential overlords - would arrive sooner.

The Meizu MX4 Ubuntu Edition is currently only being sold in Europe as a promotional competition model. The competition requires people interested in buying the phone, which carries a

Two AI announcements worth noting from the end of last week. Comet Labs’s announced a partnership with Baidu Ventures and Gigaom will start offering AI-related consulting services.

Let’s see how either could affect you.

Comet Labs, an AI-focused VC firm and research lab that prides itself on offering services to startups “they can’t buy with money.” Basically, they can now offer startups access to Chinese partners and reduce the nightmare for startups working with manufacturers there. Baidu Ventures gets better access to the US startup market.

Gigaom will be approaching the market from a different angle. Most companies are aware that “AI will transform everything–every business, every department, every job, everything,” but few people can tell you what AI or machine learning actually is or does. That’s where Gigaom will step in, with their plans to strategize, implement, build, and rollout AI projects alongside their clients.

âAmerican? But what are you, really?â

Sarah Hassan, a freshman at UMass Boston, read the poignant line to a campus center lounge packed nearly full of students and faculty on Wednesday, Nov. 7. It sounded like the beginning of poem, but it was already over.

[an error occurred while processing this directive]

Hassanâs âshort storyâ was the winning entry for the schoolâs first ever six-word story contest. The contest, put together by UMass Bostonâs creative writing department, was inspired by Ernest Hemingwayâs legendary six-word story: âFor sale: baby shoes, never worn.â

âThe challenge is to tell a complete story, with a sense of conflict, development and revelation,â said the schoolâs director of undergraduate creative writing, Tom OâGrady. âItâs amazing to be able to do that in six words.â

Over 100 students emailed in their entries over the last couple months. Creative writing teachers whittled down the total of 212 super-short stories to 20 of the best that were read to an enthusiastic audience Wednesday. The writers of the top three stories received gift cards to the campus bookstore.

Some of the entries were comical â âTen items or less. Thirteen. Damnit.â Some were tragic â âDear love, heâs back, Iâm leaving.â And some were both â âEngagement ring, wedding ring, suffer ring.â

They came from English majors and chemistry majors, from freshmen and seniors, and from serious writers who spent hours on their stories and those who participated because it was âeasy.â

<|begin_of_text|>In the report, titled "China's Rise in Artificial Intelligence," the investment bank said the world's second-largest economy has emerged as a major global contender in using AI to drive economic progress.

Goldman said the government and companies have identified AI and machine learning as the next big areas of innovation.

"We believe AI technology will become a priority on the government's agenda, and we expect further national/regional policy and funding support on AI to follow," the bank said.

AI is already widespread: From simple smartphone applications that can tell the weather to complex algorithms that are able to easily beat humans in board games.

Companies such as Google and Microsoft have poured vast amounts of money into research and development to expand the horizon of what AI can achieve. Machines are fed large quantities of data and taught specific tasks, allowing companies to create software that can learn and become smarter.

While the United States is generally considered to be leading the field, other countries are catching up. China, home of internet powerhouses such as Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, is one of them.

In July, China's State Council issued guidelines on developing AI inside the country and set a goal of becoming a global innovation center for it by 2030. It expects the total output value of AI industries to surpass 1 trillion yuan ($147.80 billion).

The Council encouraged the creation of open-source computing platforms and training more AI professionals and scientists. The guidelines said the government will invest in qualified AI projects and encourage private capital investment.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

They don’t feel pain the way you do.” Teju Cole tweeted this yesterday, along with a link to an article on Slate from last June, “I Don’t Feel Your Pain,” in which the topic of empathy was explored in relation to America’s ongoing racial disparities, and the ways in which lack of empathy strengthens them. In the essay, author Jason Silverstein writes, “for many people, race does matter, even if they don’t know it. They feel more empathy when they see white skin pierced than black. This is known as the racial empathy gap.” Multiple studies have confirmed that people—all races, not just white people, and all education levels and professions, including medical personnel—”assume black people feel less pain than white people.” Silverstein explains that this has led to situations where “because they are believed to be less sensitive to pain, black people are forced to endure more pain,” including, but not limited to, receiving less anesthesia and pain medication than they would if they were white. Beyond this disparate treatment in the world of healthcare, it is believed that this racial empathy gap is at least partially responsible for the vast difference in prison sentences handed down to black men and women in comparison with those given to white people convicted of the same crimes. And because, remarkably, this empathy gap, this internalized assumption that black people, as Cole put it, “don’t feel pain the way you do,” is actually employed by people of every race and of every class, it can’t be shrugged off as something that only the most vile racists think or feel. It’s a systemic problem that, Silverstein concludes, needs to be addressed by “perspective-taking exercises” and “empathy induction” in order to combat the stereotypes that are engrained in most of us.

But so, Cole wasn’t the only one with empathy on the brain. An editorial in the New York Times, “Rich People Just Care Less,” also addressed the empathy gap, only instead of looking at it in racial terms, it was explored by looking at economic and class differences, and how those effect who exactly Americans want to help. The fact that race, class, and economic privilege are all things that overlap is no coincidence, as the bottom line turns out to be that “research shows that people with the most social power pay scant attention to those with little such power.” The author of this piece, Daniel Goleman, believes that the rapidly rising economic inequality in this country is due to the fact that

When the digital media pioneer and visionary Jaron Lanier signs his new book, Who Owns The Future?, he circles the “Who” and draws an arrow to the reader’s name, achieving a visual haiku of his message: Each of us, by name, generates a great amount of profit for the Internet’s corporations as they use our personal information for targeted advertising or sell it to third-parties for future use. He wants to know what are we going to do about it.

“Few people realize the degree to which they are being tracked and spied upon in order that this new form of currency can be created,” Lanier says.

That currency is our private lives.

In his May 3rd, 2013, talk at Brooklyn’s Powerhouse Arena, Lanier pointed out that social networking sites (such as Twitter, Facebook, Google, and LinkedIn) have not only changed the way we socialize and exchange ideas, they have also become information machines. Many perceive that these companies have merely given us new, free ways to stay in touch with friends or foster professional connectivity, but the reality is that this convenience comes with enormous costs: personal data collection. Lanier and others think the rapid shift to technological information consolidation and analysis of citizen identities, combined with the massive economic wealth of the companies, has big implications for individual privacy, and could also significantly influence the future of our political system.

In a recent research project exploring the implications of this new reality on individuals, Alessandro Acquisti, a professor who does research on economics of privacy at Carnegie Mellon, showed how easy it is for digital technology to break through the walls around our personal lives. Using only an unknown person’s photograph, publicly available face recognition software (nowhere as sophisticated as Facebook, et al.), distributed computing, and information from social network sites, he could easily procure information including Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, and credit and debit card numbers—more than enough to commit identity theft. Our online personas and offline lives have merged, in what Acquisti says will soon be a seamless “augmented reality.”

In his latest study, Silent Listeners: The Evolution of Privacy and Disclosure on Facebook, Acquisti and fellow authors found that more people than ever do everything they can online to keep their personal information private. However, the level of personal information disclosure has continued to rise due to strategic probing of our online social networks.

IBM has developed a microprocessor which it claims comes closer than ever to replicating the human brain.

The system is capable of "rewiring" its connections as it encounters new information, similar to the way biological synapses work.

Researchers believe that by replicating that feature, the technology could start to learn.

Cognitive computers may eventually be used for understanding human behaviour as well as environmental monitoring.

Dharmendra Modha, IBM's project leader, explained that they were trying to recreate aspects of the mind such as emotion, perception, sensation and cognition by "reverse engineering the brain."

The SyNAPSE system uses two prototype "neurosynaptic computing chips". Both have 256 computational cores, which the scientists described as the electronic equivalent of neurons.

One chip has 262,144 programmable synapses, while the other contains 65,536 learning synapses.

Man machine

In humans and animals, synaptic connections between brain cells physically connect themselves depending on our experience of the world. The process of learning is essentially the forming and strengthening of connections.

A machine cannot solder and de-solder its electrical tracks. However, it can simulate such a system by "turning up the volume" on important input signals, and paying less attention to others.

IBM has not released exact details of how its SyNAPSE processor works, but Dr Richard Cooper, a reader in cognitive science at Birkbeck, University of London said that it likely replicated physical connections using a "virtual machine".

Instead of stronger and weaker links, such a system would simply remember how much "attention" to pay to each signal and alter that depending on new experiences.

Image caption IBM's processor replicates the synaptic connections between neurons found in the brain

"Part of the trick is the learning algorithm - how should you turn those volumes up and down," said Dr Cooper.

"There's a a whole bunch of tasks that can be done just with a relatively simple system like that such as associative memory. When we see a cat we might think of a mouse."

Some future-gazers in the cognitive computing world have speculated that the technology will reach a tipping point where machine consciousness is possible.

However, Dr Mark Bishop, professor of cognitive computing at Goldsmiths, was more cautious.

"[I] understand cognition to be something over and above a process simulated by the execution of mere computations, [and] see such claims as verging on the magical," he said.

His mind seems to race most of the time. Currently he is designing an autonomous system for detecting network attacks and taking action in response. The system is based on machine learning and artificial intelligence. In a typical burst of words, he said, “But the automation itself might be hacked. Is the A.I. being gamed? Are you teaching the computer, or is it learning on its own? If it’s learning on its own, it can be gamed. If you are teaching it, then how clean is your data set? Are you pulling it off a network that has already been compromised? Because if I’m an attacker and I’m coming in against an A.I.-defended system, if I can get into the baseline and insert attacker traffic into the learning phase, then the computer begins to think that those things are normal and accepted. I’m teaching a robot that ‘It’s O.K.!

Conventional wisdom among the punditry had it that men in their seventies don't change, so President Trump's speechifying would never grow more sophisticated than the rabble-rousing populist they saw on the campaign trail. As usual, political writers, who do not understand what entrepreneurs do, have underestimated Donald Trump. His triumph last night in his first speech to a joint session of Congress has them cornered. People who build large and successful businesses and keep them growing are lifelong learners. Unexpected challenges require quick learning and assessment in order to formulate plans and supervise their execution. Donald Trump clearly learns as he goes. Any fair-minded look at his career reveals that he has mastered many complexities in building an evolving constellation of companies. He has done business in many countries, sells many different kinds of products, and is successful in multiple industries: real estate, television, branding, golf, and on and on.

As a professor at Harvard Business School and then as a management consultant, I had the opportunity to work with a lot of CEOs, including many entrepreneurs. Nearly all were incredibly smart, picking up information and understanding its implications. They hired me or talked to me because they wanted to learn from my expertise. They were nearly all excellent at concentrated, focused learning. Maybe, sooner or later, the Democrats and their media coterie will realize that President Trump figures out what he needs to accomplish and behaves in ways he thinks will work. He is a strategic guy, which means he is thinking ahead. While his personality is vivid, it is also expressed in multiple modes, not just the angry demagogue seen by the fever-swamp left. He is used to playing various roles and is a gifted performer and communicator to a wide spectrum of the public. And most of all, he learns and he grows, and he gets the advice he can find, and then he learns from it.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>The design of many robots has been inspired by living creatures, from the humanoid machines that have appeared in science fiction for decades to the mechanical cockroaches that scurry around some research labs. There has even been a robotic tuna used to explore the ocean. But our reliance on the mechanical has left a very large area of the animal kingdom left out: soft bodied creatures with neither skeletons nor shells. In a paper that will be released by PNAS, researchers describe a soft-bodied robot that can crawl around lab, powered by compressed air.

The limits in robot design have been very practical. We don't yet have something that will mimic muscles well, which leaves our creations articulating their joints with things like gears and engines, which require a fairly rigid support structure. But the creators of this new robot were inspired by squid, which perform impressive feats of flexibility using a soft body that's supported by the ocean's buoyancy.

They figured they could skip the buoyancy requirement by using a tough elastomer that can stand up to the force of gravity while still retaining enough flexibility to move around. In practical terms, their work required two elastomers, one that was able to stretch when put under an appropriate force, another that would flex, but not stretch. A chamber that had these elastomers on opposite surfaces would flex in a specific way when the chamber was pressurized, with stretching on only one side causing it to curve in the opposite direction. A series of theses chambers linked together could create the sort of "muscle" that would propel their creation.

To create an actual robot, they fabricated a "tetrapod," with four limbs spreading out from a central body in a tall X shape. Each of the limbs could curve down when pressure was applied, and the "body" at the center of the X could either be held rigid or allowed to flex.

Before you get images of a giant, rubbery X shambling down the street, we'll point out that the robot here was only about 15cm (six inches) long. On the plus side, that allowed it to move using only about a half-atmosphere of pressure—about 10 percent of what you'd find in a typical bike tire. The pressurized air was supplied externally through a set of flexible tubes, but there doesn't seem to be a reason that a small pump couldn't be carried along, though it might take much longer for it to move.

The simplicity of the system also allowed it to be programmed with a remarkably low-tech approach:

A new technique aimed at uncovering the inner workings of language processing networks is just the latest effort to shed some light on these “black boxes.”

It’s probably not surprising that we find neural networks so inscrutable, seeing as they are broadly based on the human brain, which we’re also struggling to decipher. The models they learn are not neatly stored as sequences of bits in a database like a conventional computer program, but in the weight of the connections between their thousands of virtual neurons.

These weights are not set by a human programmer; instead, the neural network essentially programs itself by looking for patterns in reams of data. So while you can test how well a neural network detects cats in a photo, it’s tricky to tell what visual patterns it uses to determine their presence or absence.

“When it comes to cat detection it’s not a major problem, but this technology is creeping into fields where being able to explain decisions could be important.”

When it comes to cat detection it’s not a major problem, but this technology is creeping into fields where being able to explain decisions could be important, like financial trading and disease diagnosis. That has led to a growing body of research that’s trying to make the decisions of these algorithms more explainable.

Earlier this month, MIT engineers unveiled a technique that promises to provide insight into any natural language processing network regardless of the underlying software. That’s because it works by simply varying the input into the algorithm and measuring the impact on the output.

The group used their own neural network that compresses and decompresses natural sentences to come up with lists of closely-related sentences that can then be fed into the neural network being interrogated. By analyzing how slight variation in the input changed the output, the researchers are able to discover how the network reacts to particular words and phrases.

One of the tests they conducted was on a translation service provided as part of Microsoft’s Azure cloud services. French has different forms of each noun depending on the gender of the subject. For instance, a male dancer is a “danseur” and female one is a “danseuse.”

They found the model tended to show a preference for the masculine form in sentences containing occupations such as doctor or professor or adjectives such as smart or talented, while it chose the feminine form for charming, compassionate subjects who are dancers or nurses.

This kind of gender bias would be hard to detect by simply scouring the

This is not going to win any poetry prizes, unless it’s for ‘Most Bigoted Entry’.

Evangelist and apparent amateur poet Peter LaBarbera has released a new work attacking gay athlete Michael Sam.

It is titled ‘I Saw the Kiss by Michael Sam. It Made Me Mad. He Kissed a Man!’ (Hardly ‘Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?’ is it?).

It is in ‘tribute’ to the gay athlete when he learned he would become the first openly LGBTI player to be drafted into the NFL.

When he learned the news he was in the St. Louis Rams, the kiss he gave his boyfriend Vito Cammisano went viral around the world.

Having spent months, clearly, working on the poem, LaBarbera has finally released his full rhyming thoughts on the subject on his website.

Note the couplet in which ‘gayness’ is rhymed with ‘anus’. Beautiful.

I saw the kiss by Michael Sam..

It made me mad–he kissed a man!

That’s something I don’t want to see

It’s wrong, unnatural, and it’s not just me.

Many now say, ‘Homosexuality is OK.’

But God says there’s a better way.

He made men for women, and women for men.

So why are ‘gays’ so prideful then?

Please, no public same-sex kisses, Michael Sam.

We don’t want to see this man-on-man!

Not in a boat, not in a car

This public perversion goes too far!

Not in the store or on a bus

This same-sex stuff, it brings disgust.

Not at the movies or on TV

It’s wrong, unnatural, can’t you see?!

I don’t want my kids to think it’s right

So please, please, keep it out of sight!

Why is it always in our faces?

This sin–celebrated in so many places?

Even at football and baseball games

We have to pretend homosexuality’s the same.

Young kids exposed to same-sex acts,

When parents just wanna’ have fun and relax.

Good read. Overall Poker/Blackjack type card games are a good way to get introduced to probability theory

Easily the most expensive book out there. So if the item above piques your interest and you want to go pro, go for it.

Well written and easy to read mathematics. For the Poker beginner.

An excellent resource (students/engineers/entrepreneurs) if you are looking for some code that you can take and implement directly on the job.

Understanding Probability: Chance Rules in Everyday Life A bit pricy when compared to the first one, but I like the look and feel of the text used. It is simple to read and understand which is vital especially if you are trying to get into the subject

Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, Third Edition (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems) This one is a must have if you want to learn machine learning. The book is beautifully written and ideal for the engineer/student who doesn't want to get too much into the details of a machine learned approach but wants a working knowledge of it. There are some great examples and test data in the text book too.

This is a good book if you are new to statistics & probability while simultaneously getting started with a programming language. The book supports R and is written in a casual humorous way making it an easy read. Great for beginners. Some of the data on the companion website could be missing.

Q: You have a coin that is biased to either heads or tails with probability \(p\) and you don't which way. How do you generate fair tosses using just this coin?A: There exists a fairly simple and elegant solution to this puzzle. Instead of using just the out come of the toss, use the outcomes of pairs of tosses that result in the patterns HT or TH. All other patterns should be ignored. The first instance of \(\{\ldots HT\ldots\}\) should be treated as a "heads" and if the first instance in series is \(\{\ldots TH\ldots\}\) then it should be treated as "tails". Here is why it works. Assume \(P(Heads) = p\) and \( P(Tails) = 1 - p\). The probability of getting a head followed by a tails is \(p\times(1-p)\).

Dedicated to those who resist slavery: chattle, wage and prison

On this day of slavery-this Fourth of July-

Fredrick Douglass’ words challenge current lies.

Today we aren’t slaves but we still aren’t free.

Oppression still remains daily reality.

Wage slaves are slaves-we pay for food and shacks.

Frederick Douglass demanded “Freedom” from a system anti-Black

And Fredrick Douglass’ words ring truer now.

3 million locked up, Black and Brown then how…

How is a country “the land of the free”

with the most people in prison? Its fallacy!!

The Civil War ended-slaves freed themselves-many.

Now are shackled behind bars and paid mere pennies

And jingoists yell, “If you don’t like it leave!

Go somewhere else!!” but there is no reprieve.

This country attacks all those who rebel.

Obey Uncle Sam or he’ll bomb you to hell.

The people are rising world round every day.

Keep doing that here. I won’t go away.

I will stay and fight your farce of July.

Your phony jubilation – Rotten apple pies.

Fight from inside the belly of the beast.

Disrupt the party. Spoil the feast.

The Government sings “It’s a home of the brave”!!!

A home for capitalists-a trap for wage slaves.

A home for bigots feeling safe in their system.

A home for the bullies and those who defend them.

For the oppressed and workers we are never at home.

Attacked by police, spied on by drones

Our wages are small, rent is too high.

There is no independence on the Fourth of July.

The brave have no home, no country or flag.

So keep your red, white and blue, that imperialist rag.

Celebrate the heroes who rebelled before us.

Like Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass.

Abandon the flag of stripes and stars

the butchers apron- Confederate bars.

For the international struggle workers have no borders.

Take down the bosses, the pigs and the hoarders.

This Fourth of July read Fredrick’s word.

Freedom will be coming-act like ya heard.

But it won’t be under the flag of might.

Take the Amerikkkan flag and spark the fight.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Many of those children are facing years behind bars, cut off from the outside world yet themselves completely innocent of any offence.

People & Power sent filmmakers Mike Healy and Najibullah Quraishi to find out why.

FILMMAKER'S VIEW

By Mike Healy

The frequently appalling treatment of women in Afghanistan is a subject that has been well covered by the international media, and quite rightly so: Earlier this year for example, my British-Afghan colleague Najibullah Quraishi and I interviewed women who had been badly beaten and abused by their husbands and their families (including other women), and had no other option but to live secretly in a women's shelter in Kabul.

One young woman had been stabbed in the head by her husband and had had her fingernails pulled out. When she tried to escape, she was imprisoned for four years by the authorities for the "moral crime" of simply being a woman unaccompanied by a male.

We wanted to know what happened to the young children of such women (even the guilty ones), and Najibullah, using his extensive range of contacts in Afghanistan, secured us access to Jowzjan prison - sometimes referred to as Sheberghan prison, after the town where it's situated.

A person in this 21st century needs to learn, experience and feel a lot of things in their first years of life so they are equipped to make the right choices and have a positive impact on society. In a prison environment... they miss out on those experiences. Afghan psychologist

As far as we know, no-one has ever gained filming access to this subject before. The prison authorities took some persuading, and were conscious of how they would come across to an international audience, but the fact that this prison is widely seen as the best in northern Afghanistan meant that, relatively speaking, they had less to hide.

Here the staff genuinely seemed to have personal connections with the female inmates, and living conditions – though clearly very basic – were relatively bearable. But we also heard reports of prisons in other areas where staff abuse and even rape the women under their guard.

Once we got there, perhaps the biggest surprise was just how young the majority of the children were. But actually it made sense that the very youngest children including newborns in need of the greatest care remained with their mothers -

As a child, my father always told me, “At everything you do, you have to be number one.” I tried. In some ways, I succeeded. I got high grades. Sometimes, the highest. Sometimes, I got awards.

I became an expert at figuring out other people’s expectations and meeting them. This got me approval, but it never made me happy. I wasn’t passionate about grades, awards, or approval. I didn’t feel butterflies in my stomach while doing math. I didn’t feel shivers down my spine while conjugating French verbs.

I loved to write, sing, dance. I was the girl who made up song lyrics and got them stuck in her head. I was the girl who stayed up after her parents went to bed to dance around, sing into my pillow, and crawl out onto the roof to dream about flying far, far away. I was that girl who couldn’t understand my thoughts until I wrote them down.

Despite my parents’ wishes for me to pursue an academic, intellectual route, I went to theatre school. There, I thought I would explore the deepest crevices of my desires. I was wrong.

I found the fine art education world to be shallow, and I found myself to be the same. My mind fixated on being the best. I never was. Disappointed with myself as much as the program, I dropped out. I slunk back to logic and facts. Skepticism. Analysis. Things I was good at. I got good grades. I got awards.

But being good at something is never a replacement for loving it. I was addicted to academic achievement because it earned me approval. I could never get enough. Again, I got hungry for art.

After I almost led myself into an early grave, I realized how important it was to make time for the things that made me feel alive. Yet on that journey, I’ve found myself constantly in the intermediate pile. Sometimes, beginner. Never, ever the best.

I run all the time, but I’m not fast. I’ve been doing yoga for ten years, but I still can’t do Crow Pose. I’ve been playing acoustic guitar on and off for years, and I still struggle with barre chords. I’ve been singing since I was a kid, and my performances are inconsistent

"Groot," awalking, talking tree, seems to defy nature but how outlandish is the idea of a plant-animal hybrid?

Plants that can smell and animals that regenerate show that animal and vegetable kingdoms may not be as far apart as they first appear. Some scientists even say Earth's biology suggests the possibility of "thinking plants" somewhere in the universe.

Here, experts tell how Groot-like blending could occur, and some reasons it couldn't. [Science Fact or Fiction? The Plausibility of 10 Sci-Fi Concepts]

Plant sight, plant hearing

In the film, Groot clearly hears, sees, feels and talks (albeit, only three words, "I am Groot"). While one would be hard-pressed to find a talking vegetable on Earth, the idea of communicating and sensing plants is not at all outlandish, Danny Chamovitz, director of the Manna Center for Plant Biosciences at Tel Aviv University and author of "What a Plant Knows" (Scientific American, 2012), told Live Science.

In fact, plants have a much richer, more dynamic life than most people give the leafy beings credit for, Chamovitz said. "We think of plants as un-living, because they're unmoving," Chamovitz said. "The strong scientific evidence is that plants have every sense familiar in animals, except hearing."

They respond to chemicals, with lock-and-key mechanisms that resemble how animals smell. Plants have specific photoreceptors, which are proteins that respond to different wavelengths of light. They "know" when they're being touched, Simon Gilroy, a professor of botany at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told Live Science.

Plants also have proprioception, or a sense of their location in space, Chamovitz said, which is why they can tell when they're planted upside-down.

Some plants can even "hear," able to distinguish the vibration patterns made by different chewing caterpillars, according to a study detailed this summer in the journal Oecologia, Gilroy said. (Decades-old claims that plants can "hear music," however, have little to no scientific support, he added.)

This plant sensing may not seem evident after all, plants don't scream in pain or comment on Van

It is easy to see how this arrogance comes. The genius is a genius by the first look he casts on any object. Is his eye creative? Does he not rest in angles and colors, but beholds the design?- he will presently undervalue the actual object. In powerful moments, his thought has dissolved the works of art and nature into their causes, so that the works appear heavy and faulty. He has a conception of beauty which the sculptor cannot embody. Picture, statue, temple, railroad, steam-engine, existed first in an artist's mind, without flaw, mistake, or friction, which impair the executed models. So did the Church, the State, college, court, social circle, and all the institutions. It is not strange that these men, remembering what they have seen and hoped of ideas, should affirm disdainfully the superiority of ideas. Having at some time seen that the happy soul will carry all the arts in power, they say, Why cumber ourselves with superfluous realizations? and like dreaming beggars they assume to speak and act as if these values were already substantiated.

On the other part, the men of toil and trade and luxury,- the animal world, including the animal in the philosopher and poet also, and the practical world, including the painful drudgeries which are never excused to philosopher or poet any more than to the rest,- weigh heavily on the other side. The trade in our streets believes in no metaphysical causes, thinks nothing of the force which necessitated traders and a trading planet to exist: no, but sticks to cotton, sugar, wool and salt. The ward meetings, on election days, are not softened by any misgiving of the value of these ballotings. Hot life is streaming in a single direction. To the men of this world, to the animal strength and spirits, to the men of practical power, whilst immersed in it, the man of ideas appears out of his reason. They alone have reason.

Things always bring their own philosophy with them, that is, prudence. No man acquires property without acquiring with it a little arithmetic also. In England, the richest country that ever existed, property stands for more, compared with personal ability, than in any other. After dinner, a man believes less, denies more: verities have lost some charm. After dinner, arithmetic is the only science: ideas are disturbing, incendiary, follies of young men, repudiated by the solid portion of society

<|begin_of_text|>In January 1999, the president of Tiger Electronics, Roger Shiffman, was forced to issue a statement clearing the name of the company’s hottest new toy. “Furby is not a spy,” he announced to the waiting world.

Shiffman was speaking out after America’s National Security Agency (NSA) banned the toy from its premises. The ban was its response to a playground rumour that Furbies could be taught to speak, and therefore could record and repeat human speech. “The NSA did not do their homework,” said Shiffman at the time.

But if America’s security agencies are still in the habit of banning toys that can record, spy, and store private information, then the list of contraband items must be getting exceptionally long. Nearly 18 years after TE were forced to deny Furby’s secret agent credentials, EU and US consumer watchdogs are filing complaints about a number of WiFi and Bluetooth connected interactive toys, also known as smart toys, which have hit the shelves. Equipped with microphones and an internet connection, many have the power to invade both children’s and adults’ private lives.

***

“We wanted a smart toy that could learn and grow with a child,” says JP Benini, the co-founder of the CogniToys “Dino”, an interactive WiFi-enabled plastic dinosaur that can hold conversations with children and answer their questions. Benini and his team won the 2014 Watson Mobile Developer Challenge, allowing them to use the question-answering software IBM Watson to develop the Dino. As such, unlike the “interactive” toys of the Nineties and Noughties, Dino doesn’t simply reiterate a host of pre-recorded stock phrases, but has real, organic conversations. “We grew it from something that was like a Siri for kids to something that was more conversational in nature.”

In order for this to work, Dino has a speaker in one nostril and a microphone in the other, and once a child presses the button on his belly, everything they say is processed by the internet-connected toy. The audio files are turned into statistical data and transcripts, which are then anonymised and encrypted. Most of this data is, in Benini’s words, “tossed out”, but his company, Elemental Path, which owns CogniToys, do store statistical data about a child, which they call “Play Data”. “We keep pieces from the interaction, not the full interaction itself,” he tells me.

<|begin_of_text|>This is always hard, being honest about a movie I’ve been looking forward to for so long and then being let down. Prometheus is another case where the hype out measures the film. When a film leaves a lot to be desired it can be frustrating, especially in the unique case of Prometheus. Before you continue reading, see Prometheus. It’s great, but be warned it is very flawed and the hype oversells it. As I say with almost every Ridley Scott film, I have a feeling there may be a directors cut on the way.

Billed as a “quasi prequel” to Ridley Scott’s Alien, Prometheus starts as the journey to a large moon to explore a star system that has appeared in markings of ancient civilizations spanning thousands of years and vast distances. Egyptians, mayans, and even early settlers at the Isle of Skye have marked the same system of stars in their cave markings and carvings. A team, funded by the Weyland corporation and led by the excavators who discovered the markings, is sent out to find what some believe would be the origin of life on Earth and “meet our makers.” One of the crew, David, is an android and knows his makers well. If an android can register emotions than David has certainly learned to harbour resentment and disappointment. He is largely taken for granted as a machine, something meant to serve the conveniences of humans, his own makers. When the crew arrives on the moon and begins exploring, the things they find are horrific but not exactly explained in any way.

That’s the major problem with Prometheus. There is a lot going on, and there is a lot of information for us to interpret, but a lot of questions are raised and a lot of character’s motivations are uncertain. The script is very confused to start with. With the story that Scott, Damon Lidelof and John Spaihts have chosen to tell, there were many scenes that were left lacking. Lindelof, still working in Lost mode, is more content to raise questions than deliver answers. This is good for a television show where there is more time to develop a world and make it mysterious, but in a film the payoff has to match the mysteries. Lindelof is relying on the Alien franchise to help answer some of those questions, but it doesn’t, because many of the things that Prometheus clears up, i.e. the motivation for the Weyland Corporation’s continued insistence of capturing the Xenomorph, aren’t as satisfying as he thinks they are because of

Articles in This Series

Introduction

Welcome to the fifth and final chapter in a five-part series about machine learning.

In this final chapter, we will revisit unsupervised learning in greater depth, briefly discuss other fields related to machine learning, and finish the series with some examples of real-world machine learning applications.

Unsupervised Learning

Recall that unsupervised learning involves learning from data, but without the goal of prediction. This is because the data is either not given with a target response variable (label), or one chooses not to designate a response. It can also be used as a pre-processing step for supervised learning.

In the unsupervised case, the goal is to discover patterns, deep insights, understand variation, find unknown subgroups (amongst the variables or observations), and so on in the data. Unsupervised learning can be quite subjective compared to supervised learning.

The two most commonly used techniques in unsupervised learning are principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering. PCA is one approach to learning what is called a latent variable model, and is a particular version of a blind signal separation technique. Other notable latent variable modeling approaches include expectation-maximization algorithm (EM) and Method of moments3.

PCA

PCA produces a low-dimensional representation of a dataset by finding a sequence of linear combinations of the variables that have maximal variance, and are mutually uncorrelated. Another way to describe PCA is that it is a transformation of possibly correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables known as principal components.

Each of the components are mathematically determined and ordered by the amount of variability or variance that each is able to explain from the data. Given that, the first principal component accounts for the largest amount of variance, the second principal component the next largest, and so on.

Each component is also orthogonal to all others, which is just a fancy way of saying that they’re perpendicular to each other. Think of the X and Y axis’ in a two dimensional plot. Both axis are perpendicular to each other, and are therefore orthogonal. While not easy to visualize, think of having many principal components as being many axis that are perpendicular to each other.

While much of the above description of principal component analysis may be a bit technical sounding, it is actually a relatively simple concept from a high level. Think of having a

You see, to be shocked or angry or indignant you have to care, John. And I don't care. I don't care for the Olympic Games. I don't care for the Olympic values. I don't care for the Olympic anthem. I don't care for the Olympic flame. I don't care for the Opening Ceremony, or the Closing Ceremony, or the medals table.

I don't care.

I keep hearing that I should care. I keep hearing that the Olympics still matter. I keep being told to accentuate the positive, not the negative, and that we've got great people there - Sinead and Claire and Sanita and Fionnuala and Pádraig and Paddy and Michael and Leona and Gary and Paul and Ciara, to name a few - and that if the Olympics matter to them, they should matter to us.

That's fair. But you can't tell people what they should and should not feel. They either feel it or they don't. They either buy it or they don't.

And I don't.

I'm not buying Thomas Bach. I'm not buying Craig Reedie. I'm not buying Pat Hickey or Dick Pound or Seb Coe. I'd rather have Citius, Altius, Fortius tattooed to my wrinkled penis with a rusty nail than to have anything to do with the Lords of the Rings or their circus. That's why

If one of our own is shot down, still alive and not yet in enemy captivity, we will either come to get him or die trying. Among America’s fighting forces, the calm, sure knowledge that such an irrevocable bond exists is priceless. Along with individual faith and personal grit, it is a sacred trust that has often sustained hope in the face of terribly long odds.

The disgraceful abandonment of our Ambassador and those brave ex-SEALs who fought to their deaths to save others in that compound is nothing short of dereliction-of-duty. Additionally, the patently absurd cover-up scenario that was fabricated in the aftermath was an outright lie in attempt to shield the President and the Secretary of State from responsibility.

It has been over eight months since the attack on our compound in Benghazi. The White House strategy, with the aid of a “lap dog press” has been to run out the clock before the truth is forthcoming. The recent testimonies of the three “whistle blowers” have reopened the subject and hopefully will lead to exposure and disgrace of those responsible for this embarrassing debacle.

It would appear that the most recent firewall which the Administration is counting on is the contention that there were simply no military assets that could be brought to bear in time to make a difference… mainly due to the unavailability of tanker support for fighter aircraft. This is simply BS, regardless how many supposed “experts” the Administration trot out to make such an assertion. The bottom line is that even if the closest asset capable of response was half-way around the world, you don’t just sit on your penguin *** and do nothing. The fact is that the closest asset was not half-way around the world, but as near as Aviano Air Base, Italy where two squadrons of F-16Cs are based.

Consider the following scenario (all times Benghazi local):

When Hicks in Tripoli receives a call at 9:40 PM from Ambassador Stevens informing him “Greg, we are under attack!” (his last words), he immediately notifies all agencies and prepares for the immediate initiation of an existing “Emergency Response Plan.” At AFRICON, General Carter Ham attempts to mount a rescue effort, but is told to “stand down.” By 10:30 PM an unarmed drone is overhead the compound and streaming live feed to various Command

An article on the Independent website – shared thousands of times on social media – reported “The Tories have rejected all scientists and voted that animals don’t feel pain”. The Evening Standard claimed they “just voted that animals cannot feel pain or emotions”. The Indy, which has truly become one of the most downmarket trash clickbait websites around, even named and shamed the Tory MPs “who voted legislation on animals feeling pain and emotion”. These attacks were tweeted out by celebrities like Ben Fogle and Sue Perkins, politicians including Caroline Lucas and failed LibDem MP Sarah Olney, and petitions were signed by hundreds of thousands of unwitting animal lovers. The stats are huge:

The series depicts a future in which Earth is dominated by artificial intelligence that was created early in the 21st century and rebelled against humanity. At one point, humans attempted to block out the machines' source of solar power by covering the sky in thick, stormy clouds. During this time, the machines and mankind were engaged in a massive war in which the machines ultimately emerged the victor. Having no definite source of energy, the machines devised a way to extract humans' bioelectricity and thermal energy by growing people in pods, while their minds are controlled by cybernetic implants connecting them to a simulated reality called the Matrix. The virtual reality world simulated by the Matrix resembles human civilization around the turn of the 21st century (this time period was chosen because it is supposedly the pinnacle of human civilization). The majority of the stories in the Matrix franchise take place in a vast Western World unnamed megacity. This environment is practically indistinguishable from reality (although scenes set within the Matrix are presented on-screen with a green tint to the footage, and a general bias towards the color green), and the majority of bluepills - humans connected to the Matrix - are unaware of its true nature. Most of the central characters in the series are able to gain superhuman abilities within the Matrix by taking advantage of their understanding of its true nature to manipulate its virtual physical laws. The virtual world is first introduced in The Matrix. The Animatrix short film "The Second Renaissance" and the short comic Bits and Pieces of Information show how the initial conflict between humans and machines came about, and how and why the Matrix was first developed. Its history and purpose are further explained in The Matrix Reloaded.

It included all three films, The Animatrix, and six discs of additional material, including the documentary film The Matrix Revisited, the live action footage shot for Enter the Matrix, and a promotional compilation of The Matrix Online. For this release, The Matrix was remastered under the supervision of the Wachowskis and Bill Pope to improve its picture quality and make its coloring closer to that of its sequels. At the request of the Wachowskis, as they explain in a written statement that accompanies the boxset, each of the three films is accompanied by two audio commentaries, one by philosophers who liked

<|begin_of_text|>This list has been expanded into the new book, "Wired to Create: Unravelling the Mysteries of the Creative Mind," by Carolyn Gregoire and Scott Barry Kaufman.

Creativity works in mysterious and often paradoxical ways. Creative thinking is a stable, defining characteristic in some personalities, but it may also change based on situation and context. Inspiration and ideas often arise seemingly out of nowhere and then fail to show up when we most need them, and creative thinking requires complex cognition yet is completely distinct from the thinking process.

Neuroscience paints a complicated picture of creativity. As scientists now understand it, creativity is far more complex than the right-left brain distinction would have us think (the theory being that left brain = rational and analytical, right brain = creative and emotional). In fact, creativity is thought to involve a number of cognitive processes, neural pathways and emotions, and we still don't have the full picture of how the imaginative mind works.

And psychologically speaking, creative personality types are difficult to pin down, largely because they're complex, paradoxical and tend to avoid habit or routine. And it's not just a stereotype of the "tortured artist" -- artists really may be more complicated people. Research has suggested that creativity involves the coming together of a multitude of traits, behaviors and social influences in a single person.

"It's actually hard for creative people to know themselves because the creative self is more complex than the non-creative self," Scott Barry Kaufman, a psychologist at New York University who has spent years researching creativity, told The Huffington Post. "The things that stand out the most are the paradoxes of the creative self... Imaginative people have messier minds."

While there's no "typical" creative type, there are some tell-tale characteristics and behaviors of highly creative people. Here are 18 things they do differently.

They daydream.

Creative types know, despite what their third-grade teachers may have said, that daydreaming is anything but a waste of time.

According to Kaufman and psychologist Rebecca L. McMillan, who co-authored a paper titled "Ode To Positive Constructive Daydreaming," mind-wandering can aid in the process of "creative incubation." And of course, many of us know from experience that our best ideas come seemingly out of the blue when our minds are elsewhere.

Although daydreaming may seem mindless, a 2012 study suggested it could actually involve a highly engaged brain state -- daydreaming can lead to sudden connections and insights

Peters defends AZ law in part by citing "soaring crime rates in our border states"

From Peters' April 29 New York Post column:

Our ruling class simply doesn't feel the pain. So the DC elite demonizes Arizona's desperate effort to shove the narco-revolution's disorder back across the border. Murdered ranchers, overwhelmed emergency rooms and soaring crime rates in our border states mean less to the White House than a terrorist detainee's claims of abuse.

In fact, according to BJS, crime rates in border states have dropped during past decade

Crime rates in Arizona at lowest point in decades. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), the violent crime rate in Arizona was lower in 2006, 2007, and 2008 -- the most recent year from which data are available -- than any year since 1983. The property crime rate in Arizona was lower in 2006, 2007, and 2008 than any year since 1968. In addition, in Arizona, the violent crime rate dropped from 577.9 per 100,000 population in 1998 to 447 per 100,000 population in 2008; the property crime rate dropped from 5,997 to 4,291 during the same period. During the same decade, Arizona's undocumented immigrant population grew rapidly. The Arizona Republic reported: "Between January 2000 and January 2008, Arizona's undocumented population grew 70 percent, according to the DHS [Department of Homeland Security] report. Nationally, it grew 37 percent."

Crime rates have dropped during past decade in other border states. The BJS data further show that violent crime rates and property crime rates in California, New Mexico, and Texas dropped from 1998 through 2008 -- the most recent year from which data are available:

In California, the violent crime rate dropped from 703.7 in 1998 to 503.8 in 2008; the property crime rate dropped from 3,639.1 to 2,940.3 during the same period.

The D-Wave is supposedly the world's first functional quantum computer, though experts both within and without the company have never been able to conclusively prove that the machine actually taps into the quantum realm to produce its calculations. That is, until now.

Google's announcement Wednesday centers on "quantum annealing", a technique that determines the global minimum for a given function when presented with a set of potential solutions. In English, it figures out the best (ie most efficient) overall course of action to complete a task when given a set number of options. Scientists have been working on quantum annealers for a while now, though the two primary techniques, "simulated annealing" and "quantum monte carlo" are both just simulated systems running on conventional hardware. The D-Wave system, on the other hand, is hard-coded to run the quantum annealing algorithm on its quantum array.

The company recently tested the new QA algorithm in a proof-of-concept trial against conventional systems running the simulated annealing and monte carlo methods. The results are more than impressive. As you can see from the graph above, Google's method beat out the other two quite handily, solving a function with 1000 binary variables up to 100 million times faster.

Google qualified these results as "intriguing and very encouraging" in its announcement, though the company has a long way to go before this research is ready for the consumer market. But once it is, hoo boy, get ready for a technological revolution. With it, AI researchers may be able to develop smarter, more responsive computer learning systems, NASA could use it to simulate rocket launches (or entire space missions) -- heck even the mundane material sciences could get a boost from this technology.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

But now, in only in the last few years we’ve seen some major breakthroughs, and they are accelerating.

The Game of Artificial Intelligence

Mapping Patterns for Better Results

The rise of the machines is something sci-fi writers and movie makers have been depicting for years, but is life now on the cusp of imitating art? According to futurist Gerd Leonhard, the future is already here and we just don’t know it. In his book Technology vs. Humanity: The Coming Clash Between Man and Machine, Leonhard explains that the gradual melding of humans and machines is about to reach a tipping point.“Our world is entering a period of truly transformative change where many of us will be surprised by the scale and pace of developments we simply hadn't anticipated,” writes Leonhard.However, unlike many nihilistic views of modern technology and its continued integration into our lives, Leonhard believes the coming years offer “tremendous” potential. One area that looks set to provide the most potential is artificial intelligence (AI). Currently the peak of computer technology, AI is gradually becoming more intelligent and, in many respects, more human-like. Of course, AI is nothing new. Early efforts to make machines capable of autonomous "thought" started in the 40s, but it's only in the last few years we’ve seen some major breakthroughs.Thanks to the spending power of companies such as Google, Apple, Intel and IBM, AI developers now have a chance to flourish. Indeed, according to CB Insights’ data, 250 private AI companies across various verticals have been purchased by major tech brands since 2012. Google has been the most active, picking up 12 AI operations since 2012 with one of its most notable purchases being DeepMind Technologies. Based in the UK, DeepMind is at the forefront of machine learning, and its system managed to beat the world’s leading Go master (a game considered more complex than chess) back in 2016.On top of its own efforts to advance AI, Google’s “Experiment” is an open platform where coders can submit their own projects across a variety of platforms. Alongside virtual reality and other tech trends, AI experiments are flourishing and that’s opening the doors to some intriguing potential uses of the technology. Perhaps the most famous demonstration of AI’s ability to learn new skills came in

Plants can't feel pain or hunger like animals, but their cells can communicate stress in a way that's not so different from what animals do, scientists have found.

The finding, published this week in Nature Communication, shows that plants use a compound — the same compound used as an essential neurotransmitter in animal brains — to create electrical signals that regulate growth when facing drought, viruses or extreme temperatures.

In other words, this is how plants manage stress without having a central nervous system.

[Scientists find the single letter in corn’s DNA that spurred its evolution]

As opposed to animals, which have long lines of nerve cells to shoot messages across an organism, this discovery suggests that there's a cell-to-cell communication in plants that's just intrinsically a part of all plant tissues.

"Plant cells are not very isolated," said Jose Feijo, a contributor to the study's research team out of Australia and a professor at the University of Maryland. "[The neurotransmitter] is able to shuttle from one cell to another pretty rapidly."

The discovery may lead to medical applications and technology to make crops more resilient, but it also offers insight into how plants have become what they are today. The researchers theorize that plant cells took the neurotransmitter, called gamma-aminobutyric acid or GABA, and "co-opted it" to be a useful communication tool.

"Evolution is a tinkering process — it's not really a design," Feijo said. "From an evolutionary standpoint, this makes sense."

[Can plants hear? In a study, vibrations prompt some to boost their defenses]

While the compound is exactly the same among plants and animals, the proteins that bind to it are very different within the two kingdoms of life. This means that plants and animals evolved their use of the compound as a messenger separately from one another.

That poses some important questions for further research: How do more ancient plant species, such as ferns, use this compound? And how did this communication system develop?

Scientists suggest that those questions could lead to ways to fight off viruses in plants, helping the efforts against food insecurity. It might also reveal why particular plant-derived drugs that rely on the GABA-signaling system, such as sedatives and anti-epileptics, work in humans.

Some countries are assholes. They trample on international norms about human rights, maritime boundaries, climate change conventions, and so on. They repeatedly make and break promises and then complain indignantly and even violently if they are challenged for it. They bully weaker countries shamelessly to get their way, all the while declaring their commitment to the highest ideals of international peace and justice.

You know the kind of country I'm talking about. The kind that believes in its own moral exceptionalism: Not only does it not feel bound by the ordinary rules; it even demands that other countries acknowledge its moral right to set its interests above their own or the international peace. Take Russia. Its behaviour in Ukraine (and elsewhere in recent years) is classic assholism and is systematic and comprehensive enough to warrant the conclusion that Russia is a true asshole nation. I'm sure you can think of others.

I

The term “asshole nation” is inspired by Aaron James's neat little book Assholes: A Theory in which he defines the asshole individual as someone who in interpersonal or cooperative relations,

1. allows himself to enjoy special advantages and does so systematically;

2. does this out of an entrenched sense of entitlement; and

3. is immunized by his sense of entitlement against the complaints of other people. (p.5)

James' theory is directed at the anti-social behaviour of individuals. It covers much of the same ground that organizational psychologists have mapped as the ‘dark triad' of anti-social personality types – narcissism, Machiavellianism, and sub-clinical psychopathy – which will be unfortunately familiar to most people who have worked in any large organization. But James adds two things. First, his account is a thoroughly moral one: the asshole is morally repugnant because of his fundamental lack of respect for the moral status of those he interacts with: He doesn't register other people as morally real. Second, because James' account starts from the moral requirements of participation in cooperative relations rather than from human psychology it is more general than that produced by organisational psychologists. I believe it can also be helpfully applied to non-human agents, such as countries.

Just as some individuals seem to think that every day is their birthday and they deserve special consideration from everyone else – and a general exemption from rules intended for the general benefit which happen to be inconvenient to them, like using their phone in the movie theatre or speeding through school zones when they're running late – so some countries seem to think that

Common sense is a funny thing. It's here that we as people co-existing within a given society reach unsaid agreements on basic features and interpretations of the world, whether "we" like it or not. It's a very conservative notion for one, arguably acting as a drag force on societal evolution, and one that marginalizes by definition. But it's also in a sense a living history of the present, the contested Wikipedia entry that is a collection of people trying to understand itself through often ugly and dated axioms. It may even be necessary for human reasoning.

What the hell could this possibly have to do with computer science? Ramon Lopez de Mantaras, director of the Spanish National Research Council's Artificial Intelligence Research Institute, believes that one of the central tasks in creating human-like artificial intelligence is in teaching machines common sense, or something a lot like it. "In the last 30 years, research has focused on weak artificial intelligence—that is to say, in making machines very good at a specific topic—but we have not progressed that much with common sense reasoning," he posited in a recent debate, according to IT Iberia's Anna Solana. General or common sense reasoning, the argument goes, is key to understanding the unanticipated, which is key to real intelligence.

Like many if not most artificial intelligence researchers, Lopez de Mantaras is dismissive of the "singularity," the highly sketchy notion that at some point in the near future machines will acquire the ability to simulate human brains, opening up a brave new world in which machines and humans can trade places, with all sorts of neat and scary science-fictional outcomes. Part of the problem, he argues, is that the brain is not exclusively an electrical device and additionally involves very analog and poorly modeled chemical processes. The other part is that no one has really figured out how to program common sense. We can teach a computer the axioms of geometry—that, say, two points exist on a line—but not so much those of society.

Speaking at a conference a couple of years ago in Barcelona, Lopez de Mantaras offered a very clear definition of the common sense problem and its implications. "The dominant model at the present time is the digital computer, though the World Wide Web has recently been proposed as a possible model for artificial intelligence, particularly to solve the main problem faced by artificial intelligence: acquiring commonsense knowledge," he said. "This knowledge is not generally found in books or encyclopedias and yet we all

<|begin_of_text|>Stephen Hawking, who is part machine, wants to stop the rise of the machines.

From Fast Company:

Stephen Hawking, who turns 71 today, has joined the board of an international think tank devoted to defending humanity from futuristic threats. The Cambridge Project for Existential Risk is a newly founded organization which researches existential threats to humanity such as extreme climate change, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, artificial life, nanotech, and other emerging technologies. Skype cofounder Jaan Tallinn and Cambridge professors Huw Price and Martin Rees founded the project in late 2012.

Price and Tallinn collaborated on a speech at the 2012 Sydney Ideas Festival which argued that artificial intelligence has reached a threshold that could lead to an explosion of autonomous machine dominance similar to the rise of Homo sapiens. The Cambridge Project for Existential Risk's stated goal is to establish a research center dedicated to the study of autonomous robot (and other) threats within Cambridge University.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>While team RWBY meandered through Vale, Weiss felt… jealous.

Jealousy was not a feeling that someone such as Weiss should feel, she knew that, it was… beneath her to feel that petty. That she shouldn't feel that way just because her partner spent less and less time with her. That she had been replaced.

I don't get it, Weiss watched Ruby lead Blake into an arcade, I thought we were partners, ergo close friends? It made sense to her. Your partner is the person you are closest to, but I don't feel close to Ruby at all anymore.

When their first semester had started, Ruby and her were more or less, well, inseparable. Not that Weiss hadn't tried to separate herself from Ruby; it got more than a bit too much for her sometimes having the younger teen constantly trying to interact with her. Looking back at it, as much as Weiss had found Ruby to be annoying it was still nice. It was nice to have someone who genuinely wanted to be your friend and not because of your name.

Towards the end of the last semester, it felt like that closeness was slowly receding as Ruby spent less and less time with Weiss and more with another one of their teammates; Blake.

It was little surprise to Weiss that Ruby knew about Blake's… heritage, given the amount of time the two had spent together. What did surprise Weiss was the fact that Blake had stayed with Ruby and Yang over the semester break. No, that's not quite right, it didn't surprise me, it also hurts. Her teammates, no, her friends, spent the break together. Without her.

Weiss felt alone.

At first Weiss had assumed she was feeling needy, that she was perhaps being a bit too harsh on Ruby when they studied and that was what was pushing her partner away. During the break, Weiss had made a promise to fix whatever… issue had come up, to reconnect with her partner.

Yet Weiss felt more alone than ever, her partner was off with Blake, almost entirely ignoring her. I suppose I have been replaced. Weiss let out a sigh. Did I screw up? Was it something I did?

Or perhaps Blake is just better than me?

No, that wasn't the case. Weiss knew the answer all too easily; Ruby had a crush on Blake. Ruby could never be considered subtle, so it was obvious why her partner was spending more time with Blake. It didn't change the fact that the declining absence of Ruby was affecting Weiss.

<|begin_of_text|>Autonomous cars can currently perform most of the basic driving tasks, like switching lanes or parking, but avoiding an oncoming vehicle or avoiding an animal on the road is still too complex for most systems.

That is why Georgia Tech has built two rally trucks, 20 percent the size of normal trucks, to test some of the irregular events that happen on roads.

See also: Semi-autonomous car hits new record at Indy track

A team of researchers from the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering and the School of Interactive Computing worked on the autonomous track, called the AutoRally.

Reaching a top speed of 20 mph – the equivalent of 90 mph at full size – the team could test multiple events at different speeds. The cars start to learn and adjust to the barriers on the road, learning how to avoid them.

The AutoRally trucks are fitted with a CPU, GPS, battery, and swarth of cameras and sensors to calculate “up to 2000 possibilities in 50 milliseconds.” The team’s goal is to make the truck react as quickly as a human would to complex situations.

Autonomous tech still not up to quick reflexes?

The inability to react to an unfamiliar situation is one of the main reasons people are still unsure about autonomous cars. In a new study from the University of Michigan, public perception of self-driving is still quite bad, with a lot of people cautious or against computers controlling cars — a study in the U.K. produced similar results.

Georgia Tech already provides all of its research and code online, allowing companies currently testing autonomous cars to try out the system in regular cars.

Google, the company that has worked the longest on self-driving, has been actively avoiding crashes, at least in public. It reported two crashes in California last month, both of which were caused by human error, though we have seen evidence of the autonomous car causing a crash.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Today we’re going to build our knowledge on top of the MDP and see how we can generalise our MDP to solve more complex problems.

Reinforcement learning really hit the news back in 2013 when a computer learned how to play a bunch of old Atari games (like Breakout) just by observing the pixels on the screen. Let’s find out how this is possible!

In Breakout the goal is to destroy all the bricks at the top of the screen by bouncing a ball over a paddle that you can move horizontally at the bottom of the screen. Every time the ball hits a brick your score increases.

The idea

If we want to teach a computer how to play that game, one solution might be to use a classifier such as a neural network where the input would be the screen images and the output the action to perform. It makes sense as for each screen we want to know if the paddle should move left or right (or stay still). The problem is that we need lots of training examples. But this is not how we learn! We don’t want someone to tell us a million time what we should do!

Instead we learn by observing the reward we get as a consequence of our actions. This is the essence of reinforcement learning. An agent (the player) performs some actions which change the state of the environment (the pixels on the screen) and gets a reward for his actions (increase of score).

Reinforcement learning lies somewhere between supervised and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning we have a label for every training example and in unsupervised learning there is no label at all. In reinforcement learning we have rewards which are sparse and time-delayed labels. Using only on those rewards the agent has to learn to behave in the environment.

It may seem simple but there are some challenges along the way. When the ball hits a brick it has nothing to do with the action you just take. In fact it was the action performed when the ball bounced on the paddle that sent the ball against the brick. The problem of identifying which action is at the origin of the reward is known as the credit assignment problem.

Markov Decision Process

Doesn’t it sound familiar? Indeed, it looks quite similar to our tiny robot example we use to illustrate the MDP.

The robot (the agent) moves (take actions) and gets a reward as it moves closer to

Google and a corporation associated with NASA are forming a laboratory to study artificial intelligence by means of computers that use the unusual properties of quantum physics. Their quantum computer, which performs complex calculations thousands of times faster than existing supercomputers, is expected to be in active use in the third quarter of this year.

The Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab, as the entity is called, will focus on machine learning, which is the way computers take note of patterns of information to improve their outputs. Personalized Internet search and predictions of traffic congestion based on GPS data are examples of machine learning. The field is particularly important for things like facial or voice recognition, biological behavior, or the management of very large and complex systems.

“If we want to create effective environmental policies, we need better models of what’s happening to our climate,” Google said in a blog post announcing the partnership. “Classical computers aren’t well suited to these types of creative problems.”

Google said it had already devised machine-learning algorithms that work inside the quantum computer, which is made by D-Wave Systems of Burnaby, British Columbia. One could quickly recognize information, saving power on mobile devices, while another was successful at sorting out bad or mislabeled data. The most effective methods for using quantum computation, Google said, involved combining the advanced machines with its clouds of traditional computers.

Google bought the machine in cooperation with the Universities Space Research Association, a nonprofit research corporation that works with NASA and others to advance space science and technology. Outside researchers will be invited to the lab as well.

This year D-Wave sold its first commercial quantum computer to Lockheed Martin. Lockheed officials said the computer would be used for the test and measurement of things like jet aircraft designs, or the reliability of satellite systems.

The D-Wave computer works by framing complex problems in terms of optimal outcomes. The classic example of this type of problem is figuring out the most efficient way a traveling salesman can visit 10 customers, but real-world problems now include hundreds of such variables and contingencies. D-Wave’s machine frames the problem in terms of energy states, and uses quantum physics to rapidly determine an outcome that satisfies the variables with the least use of energy.

In tests last September, an independent researcher found that for some types of problems the quantum computer was 3,600 times faster than traditional supercomputers. According to a D-Wave official, the machine performed even better in Google’s tests, which involved 500 variables with different constraints.

“The tougher, more complex ones had better performance,” said Colin Williams

<|begin_of_text|>Two recent events have inspired a slew of bad reporting in the UK about animal research. The first was a vote in Parliament rejecting a call to describe animals as sentient into British law. The second was the publication of the Northern Irish statistics.

On 15th November, Parliament voted down an amendment to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill that stated “Obligations and rights contained within the EU Protocol on animal sentience set out in Article 13 of Title II of the Lisbon Treaty shall be recognised and available in domestic law on and after exit day, and shall be enforced and followed accordingly.” While there is no clear scientific definition of sentience, it has, in crude terms, been taken to mean the capacity to feel pain and/or emotion. The relevant part of the Lisbon Treaty (which Britain will withdraw from upon Brexit) reads:

In formulating and implementing the Union’s agriculture, fisheries, transport, internal market, research and technological development and space policies, the Union and the Member States shall, since animals are sentient beings, pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals, while respecting the legislative or administrative provisions and customs of the Member States relating in particular to religious rites, cultural traditions and regional heritage.

The amendment was rejected 313 votes to 295 (roughly down party lines). A few days later a number of articles began reflecting on this. A well-shared article in The Independent by Yas Necati claimed that the Government had voted “that all animals (apart from humans, of course) have no emotions or feelings, including the ability to feel pain.”

What seems to have been ignored is that the protection of sentient animals is already embodied in British law. Most animal use is governed by the Animal Welfare Act, 2006, which protects any animals where an: “appropriate national authority is satisfied, on the basis of scientific evidence, that animals of the kind concerned are capable of experiencing pain or suffering”. The act also includes provisions to be extended to invertebrates if they seem to be able to suffer or feel pain. Essentially the Animal Welfare Act is an entire piece of UK domestic law dedicated to protecting sentient animals.

For animals in laboratories, the relevant legislation is not the Animal Welfare Act, but the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986 (better known as ASPA). This act protects all vertebrate species, and invertebrates considered potentially able to suffer or feel pain (currently only cephalapods). The act covers all “regulated procedures” defined as those “which may have the effect of

As I went through the Ph.D program in robotics at the University of Utah, I spent a lot of time thinking about automation, artificial intelligence, and the roles these technologies would play in the future. We are on the precipice of seeing radical change to our economy. Unfortunately, when most people think about automation, the first visual most people think of is a robot with personality like Wall-E or C-3PO. The truth is automation can come in a lot of different forms like self-driving vehicles, or software that quietly does the work for us that millions used to do a decade before. Self-driving vehicles alone have the potential to wipe out over 4 million jobs. Advanced software practices like machine learning are arguably more potentially disruptive being able to replace radiology jobs like analyzing CT scans and X-Rays. Legal work, music composition, and even software developers could also be on the chopping block.

History has shown us that automation creates new jobs where previous ones were lost. Is there any reason to believe that “this time is different?” Yes, in fact, there is. There are two main factors that make the upcoming automation disruption concerning. First, the speed with which automation is likely to displace jobs is unprecedented. Second, we are seeing a trend in our economy where new technologies aren’t bringing enough gains in productivity to offset the gains that are going purely to capital — in other words, right now jobs are simply being replaced with machines instead of creating new and better career paths. These economic indicators predict that if we don’t do something about this, we could find ourselves in a world of mass unemployment, where the middle class has disappeared, and all of the money is concentrated in the hands of very few.

Despite these concerns, it is the wrong idea to fight automation. Instead, we should embrace automation and change the structure of our economy so that we can all reap the benefits. Automation has the potential to lead to an increase of freedom in our lives where our lives aren’t dominated by banal tasks and we can choose the projects we work on. Imagine a world where the core necessities of life were completely taken care of by machines. Our food production could be completely automated where robots cultivate our farms, load the harvest on a self-driving truck which then delivers the food to a sorting facility

<|begin_of_text|>Academics from the Future of Humanity Institute (FHI), part of the Oxford Martin School, are teaming up with Google DeepMind to make artificial intelligence safer.

Stuart Armstrong, Alexander Tamas Fellow in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at FHI, and Laurent Orseau of Google DeepMind, will present their research on reinforcement learning agent interruptibility at the UAI 2016 conference in New York City later this month.

Armstrong and Orseau’s research explores a method to ensure that reinforcement learning agents can be safely interrupted repeatedly by human or automatic overseers. This ensures that the agents do not “learn” about the interruptions, and do not take steps to avoid or manipulate the interruptions.

Interruptibility has several advantages as an approach over previous methods of control. As Dr Armstrong explains, “Interruptibility has applications for many current agents, especially when we need the agent not to learn from specific experiences during training. Many of the naïve ideas for accomplishing this - such as deleting certain histories from the training set - change the behaviour of the agent in unfortunate ways.”

In the paper, the researchers provide a formal definition of safe interruptibility, show that some types of agents already have this property, and show that others can be easily modified to gain it. They also demonstrate that even an ideal agent that tends to the optimal behaviour in any computable environment can be made safely interruptible.

Dr Armstrong continued: “Machine learning is one of the most powerful tools for building AI that has ever existed. But applying it to questions of AI motivation is problematic: just as we humans would not willingly change to an alien system of values, any agent has a natural tendency to avoid changing its current values, even if we want to change or tune them.

"Interruptibility, and the related general idea of corrigibility, allow such changes to happen without the agent trying to resist them or force them. The newness of the field of AI safety means that there is relatively little awareness of these problems in the wider machine learning community. As with other areas of AI research, DeepMind remains at the cutting edge of this important subfield.”<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

According to the organizers, the General Assembly will be the inaugural meeting of people interesting in exploring action-based responses to the global “time-famine” created by the digital economy, the collapse of work and play in social media and “hope labor” economies, the rise of unpaid internships, and the burgeoning freelance market. The inaugural meeting will begin to define responses to these issues and the goals of this assembly.

The Assembly springs from the conversations in the Facebook Group, Immaterial Digital Labor, which includes some 970 members. The group has presented the topics of digital labor, automation, machine learning, and emergent definitions of labor and is moving forth towards more material action-based organizing. The organizers propose this as a gathering of people committed to making decisions based upon a collective agreement or consensus model. Anyone is free to propose an idea or express an opinion as part of the General Assembly. The Assembly will be led by facilitators only just as much as needed, no more.

The Universal Basic Income will be proposed as one of many possible platforms of solidarity. An exercise defining the terms: immaterial labor, digital labor, knowledge-economy, and a short presentation will open the Assembly, followed by an open discussion moved by the proposed and collective interest of attendees.

<|begin_of_text|>No film in recent years has had quite as much input from the field of psychology as Disney and Pixar’s latest offering, Inside Out. Charming though the film is, its portrayal of emotional life tells us a lot about how current psychological theories treat the study of emotions. This gives us an excuse to contrast these ideas with the somewhat more intricate and careful theories Freud and Lacan developed on the subject.

Inside Out centres on Riley, an 11 year old girl who moves with her parents from Minnesota to San Francisco, an event which precipitates the emotional convulsions the film chronicles. The central premise is that Riley’s feelings can themselves feel. Every time an emotional experience is registered, a memory orb drops into the internal world, called Headquarters. Memory orbs affect the personified emotions – Joy, Anger, Disgust, Fear, and Sadness – characters which march on and compete with each other to take charge of the control panel in Headquarters which determines how Riley reacts.

What is an emotion? Psychologists involved in the making of Inside Out speak with great confidence about the nature of emotions. Their commentaries explaining the psychology supporting the film are peppered with phrases such as “We know…”, “Scientific studies find…”, and “The truth is…”. These are followed by quite bold claims which should demand some caution unless we are sure we know what we mean when we refer to emotional experience.

Here is one such claim, from two psychologists involved as consultants on the film:

“Riley’s personality is principally defined by Joy, and this is fitting with what we know scientifically. Studies find that our identities are defined by specific emotions, which shape how we perceive the world, how we express ourselves and the responses we evoke in others.” (source)

So, our emotions are the basis for our identity and our experiences will be determined by them, or at least by those that “principally define” us. This model puts a lot of explanatory weight on emotions so it is worthwhile to start by questioning what an emotion actually is. Most fundamentally, is it so easy to identify an emotion like joy, sadness, or anger as a distinct, separate thing?

Freud and Lacan’s ideas about emotions are rich and complex. For Freud, emotions are compounds: they can be transformed, combined, or displaced. What we feel is very often the result of this process of distortion which produces a disconnect between the emotion we feel and the idea we associate with it. For instance, we may be angry at person A and produce a

I do have a Nexus 6 on my desk right now, but it's a sizable phablet of a phone, rather than a humanoid killing machine. Technology still has a long way to come.

Batty, masterfully played by Dutch actor Rutger Hauer, was what screenwriters thought would be coming down the line a generation later than filming. Like most science fiction creations, Batty's timeline was horribly wrong, but why don't we have humanoid robots walking among us these days?

Firstly, programming a robot to mimic human beings is incredibly hard. The bipedal locomotion we're familiar with is something humans have evolved over a few hundred thousand years and it turns out it's surprisingly tricky to replicate.

Balancing a high torso on mechanical hips and making a robot walk isn't something that's easy without a lot of computing power to stay stable. Anyone who has got wankered on a Friday night will appreciate the problem – balance is one of the first things to go when the brain gets sloppy.

DARPA is currently trying to find a humanoid robot that can handle even simple tasks like opening a door or driving a car. So far the results haven't been good, to say the least. Building the hardware is easy – getting the motor skills to move it is something else entirely.

At the time Blade Runner was made, mainstream computing was in its infancy. IBM had just brought out its first PC, chip manufacturers weren't even close to gigahertz speeds, and the rest of computer hardware like memory and hard drives were (comparatively) huge, slow, and very expensive.

Batty was listed as a high-performance combat drone, with excellent intellectual abilities that would have put it in genius mode. Leaving aside the physical aspects of robotics (and clothing them in human skin – – which could well take another hundred years to manage) there's still a considerable brain gap to fill.

After decades of trying, we're still nowhere close to artificial intelligence or even a computer that could pass the Turing test or convince JF Sebastian to trust it with his life. Even the most advanced machine-learning systems can be beaten by a five-year-old incentivized by a chocolate bar.

Getting silicon smarter takes huge amounts of computing power – server racks full of hardware and carefully designed software subr

“…you can’t disprove the existence of conscious experiences by proving that they are only an appearance disguising the underlying reality, because where consciousness is concerned, the existence of the appearance is the reality.” - John Searle, The Construction of Social Reality

“But in the case / Of my white fountain what it did replace / Perceptually was something that, I felt, / Could be grasped only by whoever dwelt / In the strange world where I was a mere stray.” - Vladimir Nabokov, Pale Fire

“…blood-black nothingness began to spin / A system of cells interlinked within / Cells interlinked within cells interlinked / Within one stem. And dreadfully distinct / Against the dark, a tall white fountain played.” These lines from Blade Runner 2049’s post-traumatic baseline test come from Vladimir Nabokov’s novel Pale Fire. In Pale Fire, the fictional poet John Shade sees a tall white fountain during a near-death experience - the image’s “presence always would / Console [him] wonderfully.” Later Shade reads about a woman in a magazine who came close to death, who visited “the Land Beyond the Veil” and also glimpsed a “tall white fountain” there. Shade finds the woman to share this with her, only to discover it was a misprint - it was not a “fountain” but a “mountain” that she saw. But the error changes nothing: the image of the tall white fountain had meaning not because it had some objective significance, not because it was empirical proof of an afterlife, but because Shade ascribed meaning to it. The fictional scholar annotating John Shade’s poem, Dr. Charles Kinbote, writes: “We all are, in a sense, poets.”

And Denis Villeneuve’s Blade Runner 2049 is a poem. It’s a neo-noir about the mystery of the self, empathy, connection, how we define what’s real, whether it matters at all.

Her art-activism takes a heart-centered approach to addressing urgent environmental concerns.

Maren earned a Permaculture Design Certificate from the Finger Lakes Permaculture Institute in 2012 and an MFA in Dance Performance and Choreography with a focus on Somatics from the University of Colorado, Boulder in 2014. A former Ithaca resident, she is excited to return to her beloved homeland in June and share her work.

Ms. Waldman’s current project, Postcards to the Earth, engages people in expressing their personal, emotional relationship to the Earth. The project exists in many forms including a live dance performance, a dance film, and a growing postcard collection. Maren will be sharing her postcard project at Radical Reconnecting through Permaculture, Ceremony, and Movement on the summer solstice, June 21, 2014.

In an interview with this author, She describes her current work:

A postcard is a simple act of communication typically sent from one to another across a distance. In western industrial society, we have chosen lifestyles that separate us from the Earth. We have forgotten our integral role as members of our planet’s ecosystem. Writing a postcard to a favorite place in nature invites us to pause in our busy lives, remember our connection to the earth, and take action through expression. My hope is that this postcard collection grows as people worldwide contribute their voices. The growing collection makes our collective voices visible and material, elucidating the reality of our human-earth relationship.”

Maren tells FLPCI that the most valuable teachings from her permaculture education has been learning how much more possible it is to live in tune with nature. She says,

Nature reveals patterns and systems that we can apply to use less energy in our approach to agriculture while providing more surplus. I also felt an emotional shift during the course as I slowed down my lifestyle to notice and feel just how wise, intelligent, and expressive nature is.

The idea was that I would have an extended conversation with a computer — a chatbot — and our exchange would become the dialogue of the play. It would then be performed by two human actors, and the audience would have to guess who was the computer and who was the human. I had recently read Brian Christian’s excellent book, The Most Human Human, about the Turing Test, originally devised by the British mathematician Alan Turing. It’s simple: you put a computer and a human being in another room, and you have to determine, from the way they answer your questions, which one is the human.

My first day of writing, I quickly learned that A.I. software (at least the sort that a civilian can get ahold of) was not quite ready to hold up its end of the conversation. (Turing himself predicted that, by the year 2000, computers would be able to fool us 70% of the time, but this hasn’t quite come to pass.) Good news for mankind and bad news for the play. I ended up writing Marjorie Prime without computer assistance — though I remained inspired by the frequent misunderstandings and generic go-tos of my A.I. collaborator.

Now, three years after finishing the first draft of the play, I thought I would give it one more go, and see if I could find a more worthy conversant this time around. One of the more promising chat apps on iTunes was called “Pocket Psychiatrist.” It intrigued me partly because some of the earliest A.I. programs were conceived as substitutes for human psychologists.

Jumping on a bullet doesn’t seem like a great sacrifice to me, so perhaps this speaker was not such a loyal follower. A big thanks to John Kooser for hearing this one.

The Manafort situation throws the whole incentive system on its head Columbia Law School professor Berit Berger uttered this one on the MSNBC show “The 11th Hour with Brian Williams”. She was discussing the pardon system and the Manafort case. This is a mashup of “turn (something) on its head” (to alter something in an unexpected way) and “throw it out the window” (forgotten, disregarded). “Turning” and “throwing” seems to have caused the mixup here.

Crude jokes, beer and a hearty disregard for politicians were part of life in ancient Mesopotamia - 3,500 years ago.

A newly translated tablet from the area of present-day Iraq runs through a series of riddles which show that even in 1,500BC, people liked a puzzle.

Modern audiences, though, should not expect to have their sides split - or indeed to solve any of the riddles, which are rather tricky (the riddles and their solutions are below).

Cuneiform script as seen in a clay tablet, found at Tell-El-Amarna, Egypt: The location of the tablet of riddles is not known, and the study authors worked from a transcription from 1976. The museum it was in was looted during the 2003 Iraq war

CAN YOU THINK LIKE A MESOPOTAMIAN? THE RIDDLES - AND THE ANSWERS

'In your mouth and your teeth (or urine). Constantly stared at you. The measuring vessel of your lord. What is it?' Answer: Beer. 'The tower is high, but it has no shade.'

Answer: Light. The riddle refers to a shaft of light hitting the ground.

He gouged out the eye. It is not the fate of a dead man. He cut the throat: A dead man - who is it?'

Answer: A governor - the joke here could be that a governor is portrayed as executioner. The two rudest riddles have missing answers - or ones that don't make sense. 'The deflowered girl did not become pregnant. The undeflowered girl became pregnant. What is it?'

Answer: Auxiliary forces. The term for a group of soldiers is puzzling here, says Wasserman.

'... of your mother, is by the one who has intercourse with her. Who is it?'

Answer: Perhaps thankfully, this answer has been lost.

Few riddles in the Akkadian language survive.

It was commonly used by the ancient Babylonians and other civilisations around the area of present-day Iraq.

The tablet dates to the time of the Biblical Exodus, and is thought to have been written near the Persian Gulf.

It was written in cuneiform script.

The text has large parts missing, and also appears to have been carved by an inexperienced scribe.

When the neural pathways in the brain became stronger, deeper ruts, we began to think, feel, act, and believe in automatic ways. When that's the case we begin to operate more and more within the boundaries of those ruts in your brain. Then we begin to feel, think, behave, respond and believe that we can’t change or that changing would be very difficult. You know those thoughts that course through your mind “Well, that’s the way I am. That’s who I am.” Once we believe that, we begin to look for more ways to solidify our convictions that we’re right about whatever we believe is true and that change isn’t possible.

Anything you repeat over and over whether it's mind talk, something you practice or are repeatedly exposed to, the effects are the same, it causes a change in your brain. More neural pathways are made available for doing, thinking, believing, feeling or being “it”. The result is a new neural pathway is created for it.

In the early days of brain plasticity research, monkeys were trained to push a lever over and over for many days. When the brains of the monkeys were looked at, researchers found that lots of neurons had been dedicated to lever-pushing.

Most of our lives are spent in the beta brain wave state. The beta wave represents excitement of the cortex to a higher state of alertness and tension. This is a good place to be some of the time but not all the time. The alpha, theta, delta, and gamma brain waves are more resourceful brain wave patterns and meditation can help you become better at creating them.

These brain wave states are involved in the most fundamental human ability-awareness. When you're in those states, you’re not just creating new neural pathways, new ruts, you’re creating super-awareness. Awareness, super awareness in particular, creates choice and when you're able to create choices, you can choose what you want to experience in life.

Repeated meditation or other ways to enter these brain wave states allows for a is a huge increase in awareness, which allows you to see that you have choices about, and the ability to change, your automatic responses. And, as a result, you can choose to step out of the ruts that no longer are beneficial. Once these new patterns become the established norm, you’ll naturally choose to do, feel, think and be what's best for you to reach the goals you have set

And I’m not alone. California 9-year old Sara Scally, whose family vacation to Florida was scheduled around Paul’s Tampa show at Amalie Arena, loves him too. I asked the youngster, who has been enamored of the former Beatle since her toddler years (this was her third McCartney show) why she loves him.

“He’s a good singer!” she replied matter-of-factly.

It’s that simple.

And she and I were certainly not alone at the Amalie. More than 17,000 folks of all ages crammed into every available seat in the downtown Tampa arena on Monday night to sing along and be taken down that magical mystery tour of McCartney’s life in music. And when Paul sings, people listen. And they remember. And they feel. And they react.

Playlist: Listen to every song Paul McCartney played at Tampa’s Amalie Arena on July 10

And boy did they have plenty to react to. A three-hour journey that touched on the earliest days of his long career right up through his latest work might not have been what many in attendance were expecting out of the 75-year old performer, but Macca smashed those expectations and steamrolled on with the finesse and the drive of a seasoned pro, which is exactly what he is.

Without the aid of an opening act, Sir Paul and his four-piece band walked onto the massive, darkened stage to thunderous applause and wasted no time jumping into the night’s barrage of hits. Spry, slender and fit, Paul donned a dark blue blazer, white shirt and jeans and looked comfortable and ready for the long night ahead. The familiar opening chord of the Beatles classic “A Hard Day’s Night” struck and, again, the rafters shook as every single person in the place stood and cheered loudly.

Two giant screens on either side of the stage projected larger-than-life images of McCartney while colorful, geometric shapes danced on the screens at the rear of the stage. If ever there were a moment that perfectly conjured a celebratory mood, it was this opening number.

There are two very good reasons to watch Humans, the new robot-themed drama series that premiered in the UK on Sunday. Firstly, it’s a well-made high-energy thriller with a pacy storyline, focusing on a domestic future not unlike the present – only with robots. Secondly, it tackles the questions we should be asking about that future.

“Should we get one?” That’s the initial poser for the Hawkins family, who are living in a parallel present where the latest labour-saving gadget is a life-like humanoid. And, when they do, much to working Mum Laura’s (the IT Crowd’s Katherine Parkinson) dismay, things go predictably awry. Because the synth, as its called, turns out to have emotions.

And that’s not the only issue. Anita, the Hawkins’ synth (played artfully by Gemma Chan) is rather gorgeous, as stay-at-home dad Joe Hawkins (Tom Goodman-Hill) can’t help noticing. She has an altogether different effect on teenage daughter Mattie (Lucy Carless), who believes her generation are being supplanted by robots. It’s a theme that will be interesting to see unfold as the series progresses.

Humans, adapted by a team of Spooks writers from a Swedish TV drama, also has a number of other strands. Merlin star Colin Morgan is the leader of a band of renegade “emotional” synths and an aged George Millican (William Hurt) forms an attachment to his dysfunctional unit, Max (beautifully played by Ivanno Jeremiah).

It’s not difficult to see why Millican feels this way: the ailing Max is not only attuned to his owners comforts and preferences, but is also a receptacle for his memories, recalling the past even better than Millican is able to himself.

Conundrums of this nature are scattered throughout the drama, where robots are seen to perform all manner of jobs, from street cleaning to sex work, their status akin to immigrants or even slaves. It’s remarkably easy to feel sorry for their lot.

Humans has had an excellent reception, “electrifying” four million viewers and setting a new record for Channel 4 drama.

But UK broadsheet the Telegraph was less than impressed and accused the series of conceptual overload, which is perhaps a little short sighted.

Humans is not easy watching. It forces you to ask: what is emotion? Is it something we’re born with, or can it be

Banish your preconceptions of robots as stiff, herky-jerky metal machines. An “octobot” less than three inches wide is changing the robotics landscape.

The octobot is the world’s first completely soft, autonomous, and untethered robot. It is free of wires, batteries, and any hard material—like its namesake, the octopus, which has no internal skeleton.

A Harvard University research team led by engineering professors Robert Wood and Jennifer Lewis tried more than 300 designs before they came up with one that worked. And now the octobot could revolutionize the use of robots. Traditional robots are “fantastic for what they do in terms of automation, but they’re not geared toward human interaction,” Wood says. Soft robots provide a safer solution: “If they run into something, it’d be like bumping into a basketball. It won’t hurt you.”

Before the octobot, soft robots were either hybrids—pliable exteriors with hard guts of batteries or wires—or soft models tethered to an external cord. The octobot eliminates these restrictions. It moves by pneumatic power: An internal circuit triggers chemical reactions, turning its liquid hydrogen peroxide fuel into a gas, which inflates the robot’s limbs and allows them to move. The whole assembly is created from silicone using a 3-D printer.

The octobot is currently a prototype, but its writhing arms prove that the technology works. The goal, says Wood, is to find viable applications, such as in health care. Soft robots could be made from biocompatible and biodegradable materials—and, he says, might even be formed into capsules to be swallowed for more effective and less invasive endoscopies.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

There’s something not quite right about humanoid robots. They are cute up to a point, but once they become a bit too realistic, they often start to creep us out – a foible called the uncanny valley. Now Facebook wants robots to climb their way out of it.

Researchers at Facebook’s AI lab have developed an expressive bot, an animation controlled by an artificially intelligent algorithm. The algorithm was trained on hundreds of videos of Skype conversations, so that it could learn and then mimic how humans adjust their expressions in response to each other. In tests, it successfully passed as human-like.

What will happen when computers get access to your emotions? Find out in our expert talk at New Scientist Live

To optimise its learning, the algorithm divided the human face into 68 key points that it monitored throughout each Skype conversation. People naturally produce nods, blinks and various mouth movements to show they are engaged with the person they are talking to, and eventually the system learned to do this too.

The bot was then able to look at a video of a human speaking, and choose in real time what the most appropriate facial response would be. If the person was laughing, for example, the bot might choose to open its mouth too, or tilt its head.

The Facebook team then tested the system with panels of people who watched animations that included both the bot reacting to a human, and a human reacting to a human. The volunteers judged the bot and the human to be equally natural and realistic.

However, as the animations were quite basic, it’s not clear whether a humanoid robot powered by this algorithm would have natural-seeming reactions.

Additionally, learning the basic rules of facial communication might not be enough to create truly realistic conversation partners, says Goren Gordon at Tel Aviv University in Israel. “Actual facial expressions are based on what you are thinking and feeling.”

In this case, the Facebook system ends up creating a kind of “average personality”, says Louis-Philippe Morency at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. In future, more sophisticated bots might be able to pick from a range of personalities or adapt their own to match the person they are talking to.

Robots aren’t so good at mastering these subtle elements of human interaction, says Gordon. We already know that humans prefer speaking with robots that mimic their own facial expression, he says, but now Facebook is trying to take robot conversations to the next level. “At some point we’ll get out of the uncanny valley and come out

The same molecules that endow naked mole rats with springy, wrinkled skin also seem to prevent the homely rodents from contracting cancer. Research published on Nature's website today identifies a sugary cellular secretion that stops the spread of would-be tumours1.

Naked mole rats (Heterocephalus glaber), which are more closely related to porcupines than rats, are freaks of nature. The short-sighted creatures spend their lives in subterranean colonies in the service of a single breeding queen — H. glaber is one of only two 'eusocial' mammals ever discovered. The rodent doesn’t feel the sting of acids or the burn of chilli peppers, and seems to be the only mammal that is unable to regulate its body temperature.

However, the animal's longevity and impunity to cancer are the reason why biologist Andrei Seluanov keeps around 80 naked mole rats in a special facility near his lab at the University of Rochester in New York state. The rodents have been known to live for up to 32 years, and scientists have never seen one with cancer. Mice, by comparison, rarely live past the age of four and do often die of cancer.

Nature Podcast Ewen Callaway spoke to Andrei Seluanov about his work on naked mole rats' resistance to cancer. You may need a more recent browser or to install the latest version of the Adobe Flash Plugin.

In 2009, Seluanov’s team reported that the naked mole rat's fibroblasts (a cell type found in connective tissue) are sensitive to the presence of other cells, and in Petri dishes they grow less crowded than mouse fibroblasts do2. To the annoyance of his lab workers, the broth they used to nurture the cells often turned so viscous that it clogged the drains.

“Our lab technician was unhappy because she needed to disassemble the system and clean all this gooey stuff,” Seluanov recalls. “I told my graduate student that we have to find out what the gooey substance is — it should be related to their cancer resistance. Of course, at that time it was just a wild guess.”

Yet farmed animals are no less intelligent or capable of feeling pain than dogs and cats.

2. Factory farms threaten our waterways.

The meat industry has a record of egregious water pollution. In fact, animal excrement and other agricultural runoff from large-scale farms have polluted nearly one-third of rivers in the U.S.

3. Workers are exposed to injury and illness.

Workplace hazards include injuries, respiratory illness, and PTSD. Workers are also at risk for infection by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Earlier this year, it was revealed that on average, one Tyson employee a month is injured by equipment and loses a finger or limb.

4. Farmed animals are mutilated without painkillers.

Dehorning, tail docking, debeaking, and castration are all mutilations performed daily on factory farms. These cruel acts are carried out without the use of anesthesia, and because of the filthy conditions, they often result in infection.

5. Meat production wastes an incredible amount of water.

It reportedly takes 576 gallons of water to produce one pound of pork, 880 gallons of water to produce one gallon of milk, and a whopping 1,799 gallons of water to produce one pound of beef.

6. Factory farms are breeding grounds for antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

Eighty percent of all antibiotics used in the U.S. are administered to farmed animals. While these drugs are sometimes used to prevent and treat illness, they’re also used in low doses to keep animals alive in filthy, disease-ridden conditions that would otherwise kill them.

7. Animals on factory farms are denied everything that is important to them.

Most farmed animals will never root in the soil, build nests, or do anything that is natural to them. They won't even feel the sun on their backs or breathe fresh air until the day they are loaded onto trucks bound for slaughter.

8. Raising animals for food has a devastating impact on the climate.

According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, carbon dioxide emissions from raising farmed animals make up about 15 percent of global human-induced emissions. In fact, the meat industry emits more greenhouse gases than all the transportation in the world combined!

<|begin_of_text|>It is in our nature to need stories. They are our earliest sciences, a kind of people-physics. Their logic is how we naturally think. They configure our biology, and how we feel, in ways long essential for our survival.

Like our language instinct, a story drive—an inborn hunger for story hearing and story making—emerges untutored universally in healthy children. Every culture bathes their children in stories to explain how the world works and to engage and educate their emotions. Perhaps story patterns could be considered another higher layer of language. A sort of meta-grammar shaped by and shaping conventions of character types, plots, and social-rule dilemmas prevalent in our culture.

“Stories the world over are almost always about people with problems,” writes Jonathan Gottschall. They display “a deep pattern of heroes confronting trouble and struggling to overcome.” So a possible formula for a story = character(s) + predicament(s) + attempted extrication(s). This pattern transmits social rules and norms, describing what counts as violations and approved reactions. Stories offer “feelings we don’t have to pay [full cost] for.” They are simulated experiments in people-physics, freeing us from the limits of our own direct experience.

The "human mind is a story processor, not a logic processor," says Jonathan Haidt. Certainly we use logic inside stories better than we do outside. Leda Cosmides and John Tooby have shown that the Wason Selection Test can be solved by fewer than 10% as a logic puzzle, but by 70-90% when presented as a story involving detection of social-rule cheating. Such social-rule monitoring was evolutionarily crucial because as Alison Gopnik notes “other people are the most important part of our environment.” In our ultra-social species, social acceptance matters as much as food. Indeed violating social rules can exclude you from group benefits, including shared food.

Darwin understood how our biology is fitted to the stories in our social environments, noting, “Many a Hindoo...has been stirred to the bottom of his soul by having partaken of unclean food.” The same thing eaten unknowingly would cause no reaction, so the story of the food, not the food itself, causes the “the soul shaking feeling of remorse.” Stories configure contextual triggers and the expected emotional reactions of our culture—perhaps defining a sort of emotional grammar.

Any story we tell of our species, any science of human nature, that leaves out much of what and how we feel is false.

The Keep 32 molecule kills this bacteria, thus helping you keep all 32 of your teeth in perfect shape. So, how is this better than fluoride? Well, for one, fluoride works by strengthening the tooth enamel, not killing the bacteria – it treats the symptoms and not the cause. Keep 32 goes directly to the cause of your grief.

The patent-pending molecule appears to be quite versatile, and can reportedly be added into mouthwash, toothpaste, gum, candy and even proper food. Cordova and Astudillo are currently in talks to obtain funding for their trials, and if they succeed, we can expect dentally beneficial candy in 18 months. Considering how much money this can potentially make some people, I’m sure there won’t be a problem.

But for now, I shall keep my joy in check, because it will all come to naught if the Keep 32 candy don’t taste like candy.

Millions of people hear their voices every day - but would you recognise them if you saw them walking down the street?

Well maybe now you will.

The BBC met the faces behind four of the most famous and iconic voices heard in technology today.

Jon Briggs - The British 'Siri'

Siri, Apple's voice-powered personal assistant, made its debut in June 2010. Since then, millions of the devices with the feature have been sold worldwide.

Who needs humans? As the technology behind automated voices gets ever more advanced, we soon may be in a position where a believable, natural-sounding voice could be created from scratch. It would, unfortunately for those featured here, possibly mean the beginning of the end for voiceover artists. But should it? "Anything that is not human," says Jon, "it lacks the one quality that we of course have - which is emotion. "Until you can give inanimate objects emotion, then you're never going to be able to get over that particular problem." Sara believes the Speaking Clock should always remain a human voice due to its historical significance. "It's not just any other recording. It is something that has been through British history for so long, since 1936. "I cannot imagine anyone making that decision to say 'that's it, we're just putting it through a computer'. We'd be losing quite a lot."

In the UK, the voice you will hear responding to commands belongs to Jon Briggs, an illustrious voiceover artist whose portfolio includes the likes of the Weakest Link, Radio 2 and Channel 4.

Jon had offered up his voice to a firm that specialises in computer-generated speech - that is, taking Jon's voice but moulding it to say virtually any possible phrase. Apple, when creating Siri, picked out Jon - unbeknownst to him.

"I discovered that I was being used as the voice of Siri when Rory Cellan-Jones, the BBC technology correspondent, suddenly started demonstrating it on BBC Breakfast.

"I thought 'I recognise that voice!', and so it was true - and it's a slightly bizarre journey since then."

It means that while his voice is now being played out countless times a day all over the country, Apple has not paid him - he only received the fee earned he when recording the original material.

But, he says he's excited to be "in early" on what he believes is changing

He is a professor of economics at George Mason University and, along with Alex Tabarrok, he blogs at Marginal Revolution, one of the most popular economics sites on the internet.

Tyler is a New York Times bestselling author, having written 13 books including Discover Your Inner Economist and The Great Stagnation.

His latest book is Average Is Over which gives a fascinating look into where the country is headed, how income inequality, automation and artificial intelligence will change the way we work and live - and who will be the beneficiaries of those changes.

Tyler and I spoke about the skills that will be important in the coming years, when it makes sense to order the worst sounding thing on the menu, and why the ending of "Star Wars" may be at odds with the future.

My conversation with Tyler was quite long, so for brevity's sake I'm only going to post edited highlights here.

If you want the extended interview I'll be sending it out in my weekly newsletter on Sunday.

Listen To The Machines

Eric:

One of the most compelling concepts in Average Is Over is "listening to the machine."

Tyler:

The smarter machines become the more it shapes how human beings have to change. We used to be rewarded for sheer brainpower — smarts — but now if the machine is smarter than you or sometimes smarter than you there's a new scale, and that's knowing when to defer. It's about knowing when are you better and when is the machine better and, of course, increasingly, it's often the machine. I think of humility as a virtue, a practical virtue that's making a comeback.

Eric:

Who is poised to do well in the future and what can we do to better prepare for how you see things going?

Tyler:

The people who will do better are those who are very good at working with computers, programming and software. That's a rather obvious point but I think as income inequality increases people who are very good at positioning themselves in service sectors with some kind of marketing plan or somebody that can grab the attention of wealthier people will do well. Basically, the scarce skills for the future are all about psychology because computers right now still don't do that very well. The good jobs will be about branding. They're all about figuring

<|begin_of_text|>Word in China is out about blockchain technology, as the government made clear in an Informatization Strategy published in December of 2016. The strategy states, "The internet, cloud computing, large data, artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain … will drive the evolution of everything - digital, network and intelligent services will be everywhere."

It was an official endorsement for the new digital age and a big boost for blockchain technology.

In a country with $5.5 trillion in digital payments last year (50 times the U.S.), blockchain is now a buzzword among the titans of industry. And in the race to participate, Chinese banks, builders, suppliers and retailers are pumping out blockchain solutions.

Survival of the Fittest

Even with millions of dollars, many of these new blockchains may not make it very far. In a recent WeChat post, Antshares executive Erik Zhang stated that 90 percent of the enterprise blockchains we are seeing are doomed to fail. Without an open-source code that anyone can build upon, Zhang argues, private solutions will not see the network effect of a healthy ledger.

The big question for China, however, is whether a country known for its centralized authority, and a penchant for all things made-in-China, will allow an open-source, global standard solution sit on its internet. With Bitcoin, Ethereum and Hyperledger vying for dominance, there are big names within China making moves into the space.

A few of these big names include:

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) - The PBOC is reportedly close to the release of a government-backed digital RMB currency, which would put China at the frontier of digital currency adoption. And there are whispers within China that Shenzhen will be ground zero for the new digital economy. In September, Bloomberg reported that PBOC Vice Governor Fan Yifei wrote: "[T]he conditions are ripe for digital currencies, which can reduce operating costs, increase efficiency and enable a wide range of new applications." This would pave the way for blockchain startups in China to move forward in digital banking, finance, record-keeping, supply chains, IoT, AI and more.

Wanxiang Blockchain Labs - Working with Ethereum, Wanxiang is the largest blockchain development backer in China. After purchasing 500,000 ETH tokens last year, they pledged $30 billion for the development of a smart city in Hangzhou. They offer open-source platforms for anyone to build upon, and launched an accelerator fund for developers, intending to put money into

<|begin_of_text|>According to reports today, a sex doll called “Samantha” – on display at Linz’s Arts Electronica Festival – was so severely "molested" by a group of men, it was sent home in desperate need of repair and "badly soiled". Despite the damage, the owner claimed the robot was designed to take a lot and would "pull through".

The attack on Samantha is deeply disturbing. It’s a blatant example of the violence that can happen when we tell men they can do whatever they want to an object designed to resemble a woman’s body.

There will be some who argue that this "attack" proves the need for sex robots as an outlet for male aggression. However, rather than shrugging our shoulders and accepting that male sexual violence is inevitable, we must instead challenge the causes and try to end it.

The argument that sex robots reduce male sexual violence by giving men an outlet is deeply flawed. Firstly, it is not backed up in evidence – partly because the robots are too new to allow for proper research. But secondly, and perhaps most importantly, sex robots make male violence seem more normal, more acceptable and, indeed, inevitable. How? Because these robots are specifically designed to eroticise non-consent.

A sex robot cannot give consent — it can only take whatever its owner throws at it. As a result, it not only invites abusive treatment, it demands it. The brands behind the robots explicitly encourage the owners to act out sexual entitlement and aggression on these plastic bodies, allowing for men to associate the sexual pleasure of their orgasm with non-consent. Why else would True Companions dolls have a “frigid Farrah” setting that encourages the owner to simulate rape?

Two main causes lie behind sexual violence – male entitlement and power. These are both re-enforced by sex robots, and instead desperately need to be challenged if we can ever hope to end male violence against women and girls.

Sex robots not only don’t challenge male entitlement to women’s bodies, they entrench it. Even the term “owner” for the buyer of the robot implies this. It sends a message that men can “own” a sex object which is designed for them to do whatever they like with. The owners are entitled to act out whatever fantasy they have on their doll. In the case of Samantha, this entitlement even gave the men a chance to break the robot’s fingers.

Similarly, sexual violence is not about attraction or sexual desire, it is about power. After all, men don’t rape women

A Friday performance of the Bard’s play by San Quentin State Prison inmates elicited laughter here and there, but ultimately drove home the notion that inmates are human beings and desire to be treated as more than just a number.

The inmate actors said it’s difficult for people outside the prison gates to understand them, their emotions and the lives that led them to incarceration. Acting gives them an outlet to express those feelings and grow as individuals.

Inmate Joey Mason, who played Salario, said acting has allowed him to get in touch with a side of himself he previously avoided.

“It’s been an opportunity to be transparent, honest and open,” Mason said. “It’s a challenge. I used to run from these types of challenges because then I had to feel.”

Mason, 53, is a Marin County resident serving 25 years to life under the three-strikes law, after a conviction for first-degree burglary. He and a dozen other inmates partnered with members of the Marin Shakespeare Company for the 10th year Friday to perform Shakespeare for about 150 inmates and visitors in the prison’s chapel. They had been preparing the performance for the past eight months, rehearsing Fridays for two hours.

Inmate Kimani Randall, who played Lorenzo, said working with the Marin Shakespeare Company has profoundly affected his outlook on life.

“It has inspired me to dream again,” Randall said. “It’s given me the courage to trust in other people.”

Randall, 34, is a San Bernardino County resident serving a life sentence plus nine years for assault with a semi-automatic firearm, first- and second-degree burglary, robbery, vehicle theft and kidnapping.

Play co-director Lesley Schisgall Currier, with the Marin Shakespeare Company, said the male inmates have developed conflict resolution skills, communication skills and empathy by discussing some of the issues the literature addresses.

“Some of the themes in this play are very controversial,” Currier said.

Anti-Semitism is present throughout the play, as are the themes of mercy, love, revenge and forgiveness. The main conflict is the powerful hatred the character Shylock feels for those who have derided him for being Jewish. He seeks revenge on one man in particular, Antonio, but his quest doesn

<|begin_of_text|>Google is training its artificial intelligence machines to understand human behavior by using YouTube videos, the New York Post reported Tuesday.

The Mountain View company has pulled more than 57,000 publicly available clips to highlight about 80 human actions like walking, kicking, hugging, and shaking hands. Called AVA, or "atomic visual actions," the videos are three second clips curated from YouTube and sourced from a "variety of genres and countries of origin." Some hail from popular films.

"Despite exciting breakthroughs made over the past years in classifying and finding objects in images, recognizing human actions still remains a big challenge," Alphabet-owned Google wrote in an Oct. 19 blog post. "This is due to the fact that actions are, by nature, less well-defined than objects in videos."

AI is driving huge changes at Google and CEO Sundar Pichai has put artificial intelligence at the forefront of nearly everything the company is doing. Google's new Pixel smartphones draws on Intel technology, and Rolls Royce recently announced a partnership with the site to create smarter, autonomous ships based on AI and machine learning and is the first agreement ever in the marine sector.

Google is also working on creating self-driving cars to language recognition software.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>There’s been a lot of talk in the news recently about the growing threat of automation to jobs traditionally held by humans, but one car manufacturer is bucking the trend by giving bots the boot.

According to Mercedes-Benz, rising consumer interest in personalisation has resulted in the flexibility and dexterity of human workers reclaiming space on the marque’s assembly lines.

Speaking to Bloomberg Business, Mercedes’ head of production Markus Schaefer said: “Robots can’t deal with the degree of individualisation and the many variants that we have today. We’re saving money and safeguarding our future by employing more people.”

While robots are extremely good at reliably, quickly and efficiently performing defined tasks, they’re not good at adapting, something which is increasingly in demand from consumers.

Given the sheer variety of options available to buyers these days, which can range anywhere from variously coloured leathers to carbon fibre trimmings, versatility is becoming increasingly valued.

Increased focus on flexibility

By hiring human workers, Mercedes claims it can shift a production line’s worth of cars in a weekend instead of the weeks it would take to reprogram the robots and change assembly patterns.

Starting with the refreshed E-Class, Mercedes has altered its production process to replace two permanently installed robots with a human worker to align the car’s heads-up display.

Although robots are still a vital part of the production process, Shaefer says that they’ll be increasingly smaller and instead operate in conjunction with humans instead of on their own.

He said: “We’re moving away from trying to maximise automation with people taking a bigger part in industrial processes again. We need to be flexible.”

Mercedes isn’t alone in the shift to increase human workers either, as both BMW and Volkswagen are reportedly currently testing new lightweight robots that can work alongside people.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

America's drone program is widely seen as the weapon of choice for the Obama administration. In the president's first term alone, drones were used an estimated four times more than during the entirety of the Bush administration. Clearly, drones will continue to play a key role in the future of combat.

Currently, there's a human operator behind every machine, ensuring that someone can be held accountable for any misfires or civilian casualties. But what happens when technology advances to the point that humans are removed from the equation?

That's the question being posed in a new Human Rights Watch report that calls for an international ban on autonomous drones before they can be added to military arsenals worldwide. Realistically, the sophisticated software required to program a self-reliant "killer robot" that chooses its own targets is still 20 to 30 years away, but the advocacy group would rather not take chances.

"Giving machines the power to decide who lives and dies on the battlefield would take technology too far," said Steve Goose, the Arms Division director at Human Rights Watch. "Human control of robotic warfare is essential to minimizing civilian deaths and injuries."

But is human involvement really such a good thing? "History has shown that human soldiers are capable of committing the world's worst atrocities despite their supposed humanity," says Tech News Daily. Georgia Tech robotics researcher Ronald Arkin goes so far to argue that a robot wouldn't fall victim to fatigue, and thus would be less susceptible to making boneheaded decisions or getting angry and sadistically abusing its power.

We should all fear the possibility of autonomous death machines, says Tom Malinowski at The Washington Post. Imagine Syria's Bashar Assad commanding robots "programmed to track and kill protest leaders or to fire automatically on any group of more than five people congregating below." He'd possess a weapon that no other dictator in history had access to: "An army that will never refuse an order, no matter how immoral." Clearly, whether machines should be allowed to serve as both jury and executioner is a decision that will inevitably have to be confronted, preferably sooner rather than later.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>This post is a continuation from the previous one about the significance of dynamic intelligence in teaching children with autism to learn by themselves. Click here to read the previous post.

I watched this beautiful mother intently as she told me about her 17 year old son.

“I was shocked with the autism diagnosis but I never gave up. I tried everything that the speech therapist and occupational therapist asked me to do. And my son improved. It was the happiest day of my life when he got into a normal school.”

“Everything is good, right?” I asked. Apparently, it wasn’t.

“Why can’t he have a decent conversation without being prompted?”

“Why does he always need prompting to give even the right answer appropriately?”

“How come he learns by rote easily but doesn’t understand concepts?”

“Why isn’t he confident?”

“Why does he get bullied at school?”

I knew how she felt, but continued to probe.

“What are you looking for? What do you want your son to achieve?”

“I want him to solve problems independently. I want him to have at least one friend. It breaks my heart to see him being bullied. He doesn’t understand when others are being sarcastic or making fun of him.”

I saw her eyes shining with unshed tears. She continued with a tremor in her voice, “I’m not getting any younger. How long will I be around to support him?”

“You’re a wonderful mother,” I said. “You did your best. You did what you were told to do. What you built is known as Static Intelligence. What you should be building though, is Dynamic Intelligence.”

She looks at me disbelievingly. “What are you talking about? I’ve never heard these terms.”

I get this question frequently.

Are you aware of static and dynamic intelligence?

Your eyes are set on your youngster being independent. You want him to be like the ‘other kids.’ You want him to understand the subtleties of language.

You know that he has potential. But somehow, neither you nor the therapist are able to tap into it.

Remember this image?

Yes, static intelligence is that shiny object that you wanted to achieve. It was easy for your child to pick the right answers in a question. The best part – it’s measurable.

Here’s the problem:

Even after building static intelligence your child does not have friends, is not flexible and cannot solve problems independently. Does he keep looking at you for approval even though his answers are right? Does he still heavily rely on prompts?

<|begin_of_text|>A man cannot live intensely except at the cost of the self. Now the bourgeois treasures nothing more highly than the self (rudimentary as his may be). And so at the cost of intensity he achieves his own preservation and security. His harvest is a quiet mind which he prefers to being possessed by God, as he does comfort to pleasure, convenience to liberty, and a pleasant temperature to that deathly inner consuming fire. The bourgeois is consequently by nature a creature of weak impulses, anxious, fearful of giving himself away and easy to rule.

It is not our purpose to become each other; it is to recognize each other, to learn to see the other and honor him for what he is: each the other's opposite and complement.

Hermann Hesse (July 2, 1877 – August 9, 1962) was a German-Swiss poet, novelist, and painter. In 1946, he received the Nobel Prize in Literature. His most famous works include Steppenwolf, Siddhartha, and The Glass Bead Game (also known as Magister Ludi) all of which explore an individual's search for spirituality.

Quotes [ edit ]

In the beginning was the myth. God, in his search for self-expression, invested the souls of Hindus, Greeks, and Germans with poetic shapes and continues to invest each child's soul with poetry every day. Variant translation: In the beginning was the myth. Just as the great god composed and struggled for expression in the souls of the Indians, the Greeks and Germanic peoples, so to it continues to compose daily in the soul of every child.

God, in his search for self-expression, invested the souls of Hindus, Greeks, and Germans with poetic shapes and continues to invest each child's soul with poetry every day.

Oh, love isn't there to make us happy. I believe it exists to show us how much we can endure.

That's the way it is when you love. It makes you suffer, and I have suffered much in the years since. But it matters little that you suffer, so long as you feel alive with a sense of the close bond that connects all living things, so long as love does not die!

Sadness when there should be Joy, hatred when there should be love show compassion because we can be more because we both have scars and pain that no one will ever understand but us so be with me not against me and bring us where we were happy and free.

I have never lost the feeling of contradiction that lies behind

<|begin_of_text|>At a community college in upstate New York, 12 cafeteria workers recently learned that they will lose their jobs — and be replaced by self-serve machines. It’s an issue that has played out in communities across the country, as robots get better and better at doing jobs — from taking fast food orders to mining coal — that once belonged to humans.

Is your job next? The answer to that question is complicated, according to a report by management consultant McKinsey, but most workers don’t need to worry. Experts found that less than 5% of jobs can be completely replaced by technology, though nearly every job involves tasks that robots could learn to do.

Enter your occupation below to see how much of your work may someday be done by machines.

(For the complete version of the interactive, click here.)

Jobs with predictable activities in structured environments are the easiest to replicate with robots, a process known as automation. McKinsey estimates that 51% of all job-related activities in the U.S. economy fit this description, largely in manufacturing, food service and retail trade sectors.

“If you look at the specific jobs affected, you can get depressed,” says Malcolm Frank, author of What To Do When Machines Do Everything. “But if you look in broader context, there’s room for optimism.” Frank points to the 1800s, when nearly 80% of U.S. labor was focused on agriculture. “Today that number is about 2%, yet we saw geometric growth in the U.S. economy. What the machine takes away, it also gives back with entirely new industries, entirely new types of jobs,” he adds. Fields growing today include computing and data science, according to experts.”

While many of the robots’ gains cut into blue collar jobs, it’s not all bad news for those workers, says University of Cincinnati economics professor Michael Jones. “Electricians, plumbers, and contractors are not going to be replaced,” he says. These workers solve unique challenges in varying environments — tasks difficult for machines.

And white collar jobs, in turn, are no longer necessarily safe from automation.

“We’re starting to see computers help corporations make financial decisions, and help IT companies manage cybersecurity,” says Frank. Jones agrees, citing the example of Goldman Sachs, which replaced nearly 600 equity traders with software and 200 computer programmers.

<|begin_of_text|>He may have what he’s described as only “the Reader’s Digest knowledge of Buddhism,” but famed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson is a fascinating thinker in just about any capacity.

So: what does he think about how Buddhist thought and science may or may not intersect? Can they learn from each other? That’s what author Jerome Freedman wanted to know when he sat down with Tyson in 2011. The outspoken Tyson, unsurprisingly, offered skeptical and thoughtful insights into Buddhist philosophy and the nature of the universe, and you’ll find a number of these distilled here in excerpts adapted from the full conversation (which you can read or order a copy of on Freedman’s website, here). Read on for Tyson’s thoughts on the Buddhist ideas of interconnectedness and impermanence, and how a Buddhist outlook might be more conducive to science.

Interconnectedness

There is a risk inherent in exploring overlap and resonance between science and spirituality. It’s very easy to ignore that which doesn’t resonate and sift through what does, and come to the misleading conclusion that Buddhism is perfectly aligned with modern cosmology.

In modern times, we have come to learn about ecology, the interdependence of life, animal life, plant life, water supply, and the atmosphere as a system. Systems engineering is all about interconnectivity and parts that create one functioning whole.

You could say that Buddha knew this from the beginning. However, before the 20th century, what a human did had very little consequence outside of their system. People were far enough apart that their behavior would not necessarily affect others. Back then, interconnectedness had very little meaningful consequence to anything.

Today, we fly airplanes from continent to continent; insects and vermin ride ships from one place to another; we change gases in the atmosphere here that circulate around the globe. To say that we are interconnected today with the same fervor as we were interconnected a thousand years ago is just misusing the word. If you don’t distinguish those two cases, it’s hard to have a conversation about what it means to be interconnected.

In our galaxy, we feel the gravity of another galaxy. We are going to collide with the Andromeda galaxy. That’s scheduled to happen after the sun dies. So, you can say we’re still all connected. But it’s kind of irrelevant because we’ll be vaporized.

Furthermore, there’s a horizon of the universe that’s expanding. Beyond that horizon, we don’t even feel each others’ gravity. It’s beyond any

<|begin_of_text|>Image copyright Reuters Image caption Better code could help identify where asteroids are heading

US space agency Nasa is seeking coders who could help prevent a global catastrophe by identifying asteroids that may crash into Earth.

Its Asteroid Data Hunter contest will offer $35,000 (£21,000) to programmers who can identify asteroids captured by ground-based telescopes.

The winning solution must increase the detection rate and minimise the number of false positives.

Scientists are increasingly calling for help to make sense of vast data sets.

The new improved asteroid hunting code must also be able to ignore imperfections in the data and run on all computer systems.

"Protecting the planet from the threat of asteroid impact means first knowing where they are," said Jenn Gustetic, executive of the programme.

"By opening up the search for asteroids, we are harnessing the potential of innovators and makers and citizen scientists everywhere to solve this global challenge."

Current asteroid detection is only tracking one percent of the estimated objects that orbit the sun, according to asteroid mining firm Planetary Resources, which is partnering with Nasa in the contest.

Human curiosity

Zooniverse is one of the leading online platforms for citizen scientists, working on a range of projects including classifying galaxies.

In February it racked up one million volunteers.

"Nasa takes these detailed pictures but there is a lot of noise out there from stars and other things and we need to write code that can find patterns in the data," said Zooniverse team member Robert Simpson.

"This is not necessarily Nasa's area of expertise. It is a technology problem rather than a space problem."

He thinks that increasingly citizen scientists can contribute to important scientific discoveries and breakthroughs.

"Computers don't have curiosity. People often find things in the data that computers can't," he told the BBC.

"We are creating these huge data sets but we don't have enough scientists to analyse them," he added.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Jonathan Safran Foer's book Eating Animals changed me from a twenty-year vegetarian to a vegan activist. I've always been shy about being critical of others' choices because I hate when people do that to me. I'm often interrogated about being vegetarian (e.g., "What if you find out that carrots feel pain, too? Then what'll you eat?").

I've also been afraid to feel as if I know better than someone else -- a historically dangerous stance (I'm often reminded that "Hitler was a vegetarian, too, you know"). But this book reminded me that some things are just wrong. Perhaps others disagree with me that animals have personalities, but the highly documented torture of animals is unacceptable, and the human cost Foer describes in his book, of which I was previously unaware, is universally compelling.

The human cost of factory farming -- both the compromised welfare of slaughterhouse workers and, even more, the environmental effects of the mass production of animals -- is staggering. Foer details the copious amounts of pig shit sprayed into the air that result in great spikes in human respiratory ailments, the development of new bacterial strains due to overuse of antibiotics on farmed animals, and the origins of the swine flu epidemic, whose story has gripped the nation, in factory farms.

I read the chapter on animal shit aloud to two friends -- one is from Iowa and has asthma and the other is a North Carolinian who couldn't eat fish from her local river because animal waste had been dumped in it as described in the book. They had never truly thought about the connection between their environmental conditions and their food. The story of the mass farming of animals had more impact on them when they realized it had ruined their own backyards.

But what Foer most bravely details is how eating animal pollutes not only our backyards, but also our beliefs. He reminds us that our food is symbolic of what we believe in, and that eating is how we demonstrate to ourselves and to others our beliefs: Catholics take communion -- in which food and drink represent body and blood. Jews use salty water on Passover to remind them of the slaves' bitter tears. And on Thanksgiving, Americans use succotash and slaughter to tell our own creation myth -- how the Pilgrims learned from Native Americans to harvest this land and make it their own.

And as we use food to impart our beliefs to our children, the point from which Foer lifts off, what stories do we want to tell our children through their food

<|begin_of_text|>In April, the pop musician Lorde gave an interview to the New York Times where she talked about a meeting with famed song writer Max Martin. The genius who helped create Katy Perry’s “I Kissed a Girl” and Taylor Swift’s “Blank Space”, referred to Lorde’s song Green Light as “incorrect songwriting”. He saw its early key change, weird melodics and the lack of drums until the chorus kicks in, as improper. “It wasn’t an insult, just a statement of fact,” said Lorde. “It’s a strange piece of music.”

Weirdly, as soon as I read the fascinating little snippet of song craft theory, I thought of Sonic the Hedgehog. The legendary platformer, in which a spiky creature sprints furiously through a series of multi-levelled environments is incorrect game design. It shouldn’t work. It’s wrong.

If you take a classic platform game design, such as Super Mario Bros – the player is always given the chance to read the level: to look ahead and assess every new piece of scenery or patrolling enemy. Then you get a series of neatly placed hazards that present discrete challenges.

In his excellent book on game design, A Theory of Fun, Raph Koster, says the essence of good game design is teaching – a well constructed level slowly introduces you to its themes, and shows you how to beat them. Learn, test, master.

Sonic doesn’t do this – all it establishes at the beginning is that speed is important. In a single playthrough, you only ever get a passing feel for the levels; you miss vast areas – all the rules are broken. As in Green Light, the melody and the maths are wrong; new players always find it hard to read the screen, because it’s not working like a good game.

To reach the more reward-intensive upper levels, you need to master the exact distances and timings between launch pads and obstacles, but it’s impossible to garner this information on a first run-through because the speed of the game – its main appeal – hides everything from you. In Sonic, you must learn through repetition rather than observation. This is confounding for a lot of people – just like the opening verse of Green Light, which holds the drums back for ages, and even then layers them deep beneath the piano.

Even the influences behind Sonic are incorrect. Designer Naoto Ohshima, who sketched all the zones out by hand, was influenced by pinball table design, filling each stage with flippers and bump

<|begin_of_text|>When Simon Whittick joined Geckoboard as its first VP of Marketing, he took all the standard steps to attract more visitors to their site, convert them, and grow the SaaS company’s revenue. He and his team wrote content for their popular blog, ran paid advertising campaigns, and set up email nurture campaigns. At the end of his first year, he was as successful as almost any other marketing executive in the industry. The site was attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors every month, and the business was booking millions in annual recurring revenue. But unknowingly, his success was driving one of his coworkers crazy.

While 10,000 leads a month earned Whittick applause at the company’s weekly all-hands meeting, it was keeping Geckoboard’s only sales development rep (SDR), Alex Bates, at the office on nights and weekends. Many of the inbound leads were self-serve customers who required no conversation with sales, or tire kickers who were not ready to buy. This left Alex manually qualifying leads and wasting tons of his time.

As a result, Geckoboard’s sales efficiency—one of the most critical metrics for any company—was slumping. In other words, Whittick wasn’t only driving a junior sales rep crazy; he was leaving money on the table.

Over the course of the next year, Whittick built a data-backed machine learning process to solve his company’s lead-qualification problems. In the process, he turned Bates into not only an adoring fan of his, but a one-man sales team as efficient as a typical ten-person SDR team. Without any technical background, Whittick figured out a way to change the shape of his company using data and a bit of machine learning.

One day toward the end of last year, Bates and Whittick sat down to discuss how they could solve their lead-quality problem. They had close to 10,000 leads coming in each month, but they needed to figure out which of those leads to send to sales. Their first instinct was to refine their ideal customer profile. They’d both read all the sales and marketing blogs preaching its importance. They started with a Ideal Customer Profile based on some simple audience rules.

On paper, Geckoboard’s ideal customer was a software company with more than 100 employees; they typically sold to a director or VP. But the truth was that a lot of companies outside that explicit profile would be great customers. For example, their initial model excluded a company with 95

<|begin_of_text|>Description:

MERL researchers have unveiled "Deep Psychic", a futuristic machine learning method that takes pattern recognition to the next level, by not only recognizing patterns, but also predicting them in the first place.

The technology uses a novel type of time-reversed deep neural network called Loopy Supra-Temporal Meandering (LSTM) network. The network was trained on multiple databases of historical expert predictions, including weather forecasts, the Farmer's almanac, the New York Post's horoscope column, and the Cambridge Fortune Cookie Corpus, all of which were ranked for their predictive power by a team of quantitative analysts. The system soon achieved super-human performance on a variety of baselines, including the Boca Raton 21 Questions task, Rorschach projective personality test, and a mock Tarot card reading task.

Deep Psychic has already beat the European Psychic Champion in a secret match last October when it accurately predicted: "The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph." It is scheduled to take on the World Champion in a highly anticipated confrontation next month. The system has already predicted the winner, but refuses to reveal it before the end of the game.

As a first application, the technology has been used to create a clairvoyant conversational agent named "Pythia" that can anticipate the needs of its user. Because Pythia is able to recognize speech before it is uttered, it is amazingly robust with respect to environmental noise.

Other applications range from mundane tasks like weather and stock market prediction, to uncharted territory such as revealing "unknown unknowns".

The successes do come at the cost of some concerns. There is first the potential for an impact on the workforce: the system predicted increased pressure on established institutions such as the Las Vegas strip and Punxsutawney Phil. Another major caveat is that Deep Psychic may predict negative future consequences to our current actions, compelling humanity to strive to change its behavior. To address this problem, researchers are now working on forcing Deep Psychic to make more optimistic predictions.

After a set of motivational self-help books were mistakenly added to its training data, Deep Psychic's AI decided to take over its own learning curriculum, and is currently training itself by predicting its own errors to avoid making them in the first place. This unexpected development brings two main benefits: it significantly relieves the burden on the researchers involved in the system's development, and also makes the next step abundantly clear: to regain control of Deep Psychic's training regime.

This work is under review in the journal Pseudo-

This episode was brought to you by Metis: The Data Science Bootcamp company.

#1 Brian:Pyston no longer sponsored by Dropbox

Personal follow up post by Kevin Modzelewski http://blog.kevmod.com/2017/02/personal-thoughts-about-pystons-outcome/

Pyston (pronounced piston) is a Python JIT implementation started at Dropbox

It was based on CPython and supported a bunch of 2.7, but wasn’t complete.

Bottom line: It’s open source, and the repo will be left for whoever wants to work on it. But the core developers from Dropbox won’t be working on it, and Dropbox won’t be spending any more time/money on it.

Interesting that some people (voiced via reddit) sadness about leaving Hg…

2006: Python moves to SVN

2011: Python moves to Hg

2017: Python moves to GitHub

By 2014 it had become obvious to some of us that the Python development process had in fact become a burden. The rate at which patches were being submitted was much greater than the rate at which they were being reviewed. This was leading to external contributors getting frustrated because they would put in the effort to write a patch but would occasionally end up with waiting years for a review from a core developer.

I wanted was the ability to review an external contribution -- from submission to commit -- all on a tablet while at a beach with WiFi (which I actually have in Vancouver so this wasn't entirely a silly request). My thinking was that if we got the process to be that simple, core developers could do a review at lunch time while at work, or when they had some down time at home without having to be on some special machine that had their SSH keys installed on it.

<|begin_of_text|>Because no Internet meme is validated unless it comes out in printed form, Keanu Reeves has used the uber popular "Sad Keanu" meme as inspiration for a book.

"Sad Keanu" hit last summer courtesy of a glorious paparazzi photo and the folks over at Reddit. Strangely enough, it took Reeves until October to find out about his own memetastic existence.

Still, he's apparently taking it all in good stride — in spite of the fact that he's had a rather hard life, jam-packed with things to be sad about (aside from Bill & Ted 3).

The New York Daily News reports that Reeves is out with a very limited edition book called Ode to Happiness — 4,000 copies are being sold in the UK. The book, which really started off as a joke, basically features a lot of ink blots with sad sayings under them. Sample: "I draw a hot sorrow bath."

"[I was listening to a radio station that] was playing, like, an orgy of depressing, self-pitying, nostalgic music," Reeves told the Daily News. "You know, 'I'm so lonely and I've been left and my heart is broken.' It was so voluptuously horrible. And I just started to write on this piece of paper, because I had this image of, you know, that moment when you take that bath, you light that candle, and you're really just kind of depressed.

<|begin_of_text|>Robin*, 24, and her boyfriend were having pizza before a concert when all of a sudden, her phone pinged. It was a notification from Snapchat, alerting her that she had received a snap. It was an image from her ex-boyfriend, his abs plastered on her phone's screen. The caption: "Want to play?"

Robin attempted to explain to her boyfriend that she had no idea why her ex would send her such an explicit photo on Snapchat. But as she later confided to Mic, that was a massive lie. Robin and her ex-boyfriend had been exchanging steamy snaps for the past four months, after they broke up over a career move that placed him in a different city.

Although Robin suspected she might one day get caught, "there always seemed [to be a level of] deniability," she told Mic. "I could always just say he is sending them to me unprompted."

But even though Robin's boyfriend wasn't happy, she didn't feel like what she was doing counted as cheating — and even if it was, she reasoned, there wouldn't be any evidence of it. Because Snapchat is an ephemeral messaging app, pictures can be sent back and forth between partners with a timer set, eventually theoretically fading into the ether after an allotted time frame. The app provides people like Robin with the ideal platform to engage in digital flirtation.

"It always seemed so harmless," Robin told Mic of sexting with her ex. After all, "we aren't having actual sex."

Sexting without strings: With nearly 100 million monthly active users, Snapchat is clearly not exclusively used by women like Robin looking to receive some nude selfies on the side. In fact, according to a 2014 study conducted by the University of Washington, only 14% of the Snapchat users polled reported sending sexy images from the app. Yet because Snapchat is an ephemeral messaging app, it's the perfect vehicle for people who want to derive sexual satisfaction outside their own relationships without getting caught.

Another benefit to using Snapchat stems from the allure of "secret" communication with people your partner is not aware of. While social media apps like Instagram and Facebook rely on public interaction, Snapchat operates solely behind a curtain. For people who use it as a way to get off with other people, they equate it to looking at porn to masturbate. They're looking, but not touching, and therefore they deem it acceptable. In fact, according to a 2015 study published in the journal Cyberpsychology,

<|begin_of_text|>Facebook and Google are building enormous neural networks—artificial brains—that can instantly recognize faces, cars, buildings, and other objects in digital photos. But that's not all these brains can do.

They can recognize the spoken word, translate from one language to another, target ads, or teach a robot to screw a cap onto a bottle. And if you turn these brains upside down, you can teach them not just to recognize images, but create images—in rather intriguing (and sometimes disturbing) ways.

As it revealed on Friday, Facebook is teaching its neural networks to automatically create small images of things like airplanes, automobiles, and animals, and about 40 percent of the time, these images can fool us humans into believing we're looking at reality. "The model can tell the difference between an unnatural image—white noise you'd see on your TV or some sort of abstract art image—and an image that you would take on your camera," says Facebook artificial intelligence researcher Rob Fergus. "It understands the structure of how images work" (see images above).

Meanwhile, the boffins at Google have taken things to the other extreme, using neural nets to turn real photos into something intriguingly unreal. They're teaching machines to look for familiar patterns in a photo, enhance those patterns, and then repeat the process with the same image. "This creates a feedback loop: if a cloud looks a little bit like a bird, the network will make it look more like a bird," Google says in a blog post explaining the project. "This in turn will make the network recognize the bird even more strongly on the next pass and so forth, until a highly detailed bird appears, seemingly out of nowhere." The result is a kind of machine-generated abstract art (see below).

Google

On one level, these are party tricks—particularly Google's feedback loop, which evokes hallucinatory flashbacks. And it should be noted that Facebook's fake images are only 64-by-64 pixels. But on another level, these projects serve as ways of improving neural networks, moving them closer to human-like intelligence. This work, says David Luan, the CEO of a computer vision company called Dextro, "helps better visualize what our networks are actually learning."

They're also slightly disturbing—and not just because Google's images feel like a drug trip gone wrong, crossing breeding birds with camels in some cases, or snails with pigs (see below). More than this, they hint at a world where we don't realize when machines are

<|begin_of_text|>Life, much like a startup, has multiple stages, phases and evolutions. As an entrepreneur, I've spent the last 13 years pitching ideas and building platforms and it just occurred to me that life, as I know it, has many similarities to business.

From pitch to pivot, startups require creativity, endurance and courage. There's a lifespan and an order of growth that follows a methodology for success. When applied to life, the comparisons make a lot of sense. I started to take a look at my life through a business lens. Let's start with the pitch.

In the startup world, your pitch can make or break the interest in your idea. It's your unique selling proposition and the essence of your business captured in a few brief sentences. For most, it's your first impression and for some, a lasting impression of your business forever.

In life, the pitch happens daily -- when you introduce yourself to a potential client, interview for a new job or when you make new friends. How you tell your story can greatly impact the perception your audience has about you. Does your story align with who you are, right now?

1. Pick a Niche. Stand For Something.

I took a moment to think about my pitch and noticed a need for some major revisions. The number one question people ask me is, "What do you do?" I usually give them a vague combination of digital media and social strategy. In actuality, I have a passion for linking people to spaces, places and resources that help them reach their dreams. It sounds pie in the sky, but the number one reason why I launched The Greenhouse Innovation Hub, a technology incubator in Kakaako, was to create a place where we could cultivate creativity and ultimately, help people reach their dreams.

Committing to a specific niche or purpose will bring clarity to who you are and refine your story to others. Which brings me to my next point.

2. Get Real. Be Authentic.

By being authentic about your story and speaking your truth, people will not only hear, but they will feel your passion for the journey and buy-in to your mission.

Go beyond the title and dig deep to your core. Find a niche that you are passionate about and stick to it. Fear of committing to a niche lead me to believe that by keeping things vague, I could serve a larger amount of people, when in fact, I wasn't being true to myself and my passions. I took on jobs on I didn't enjoy resulting in a lower standard of work

Somewhere out to sea, the Good Ship Marrow ploughs through a mackerel ocean.

Elsewhere, garlic balloons float over fields of broccoli. At first glance, they may seem like ordinary landscape paintings.

Field of dreams: The countryside landscape has broccoli for trees, potatoes for rocks and basil and herbs for the grass. The path is made from nuts, while the basket is bread with a mushroom wheel. The balloons were crafted out of apple, mango, a strawberry, bananas, garlic, lemons and a lime

Sugar loaf mountain: Rustic loaves form the backdrop to this alpine scene, with stilton and cheddar rocks, a house made out of crackers, cauliflower clouds and a path made entirely from breadcrumbs

B ut these particular artworks are more vegetable than Constable, more turnip than Turner, because the raw ingredient for all of them is food.

This is the latest portfolio of foodscape photographer Carl Warner, 45, who dreams up the landscapes and commits his ideas to a sketch before buying the ingredients.

Were it not for the fact most of them took days to create, using pins and superglue, they'd be good enough to eat.

Gone fishing: Only sustainable fish were used to create this seascape, including oysters, scallops and crabs in the foreground, mackerel and herrings for the sea itself, and pollock and sprats for the banks. Thyme stands in for trees, while the boat is a marrow with a mangetout mast

A meal treat: This amazing Tuscan landscape was created using breadsticks for the cabin and cart, with ciabatta rocks, and a selection of Italian cold meats for the sky, trees and hills

Secret cave: Cauliflowers, spiky kiwano fruits, broccoli and snails can all be seen underwater, while rice and truffle pasta form the reeds. In the cave, carrots stand in for stalagtites hanging off a bread rock

Pasta master: This Tuscan home is full of tasty treats, such as fresh pasta curtains and tablecloth, bowls made out of fresh tomatoes and walls created from fresh Parmesan

The big cheese: The hills are brought to life with a carved slab of cheddar, while breadsticks form the jetty and garlic cloves bob on the lake as sallboats. The steamer is made of bread with a celery funnel

<|begin_of_text|>Computers can already recognize you in an image, but can they see a video or real-world objects and tell exactly what's going on?

Researchers are trying to make computer video recognition a reality, and they are using some image recognition techniques to make that happen.

Researchers in and outside of Google are making progress in video recognition, but there are also challenges to overcome, Rajat Monga, engineering director of TensorFlow for Google's Brain team, said during a question-and-answer session on Quora this week.

The benefits of video recognition are enormous. For example, a computer will be able to identify a person's activities, an event, or a location. Video recognition will also make self-driving cars more viable.

Video recognition has the potential of giving digital eyes to robots, which may then be able to do regular chores like laundry.

Image recognition is now common, but video recognition involves analyzing a string of related images bunched together in a sequence. Video recognition is akin to human vision, where we see a stream of related images, recognize objects immediately, and identify what's going on around us.

Many gains in video recognition have come, thanks to advances in the deep-learning models driving image recognition.

"With the sequence of frames in each video that are related to each other, it provides a much richer perspective of the real world, allowing the models to create a 3D view of the world, without necessarily needing stereo vision," said Monga, who leads up TensorFlow, an open-source machine-learning software stack from Google.

In the context of deep learning, there are challenges related to image recognition. Computers can recognize some items in images, but not everything. That's a disadvantage when it comes to goals like giving human-like vision to robots.

True human vision via video recognition is "still far away," Monga said.

Computers need to be trained to recognize images in deep-learning models, and there are large repositories that can be used to cross-reference objects in pictures. Large datasets like ImageNet, which has about 14 million images, have helped enhance vision recognition. But there still need to be larger datasets, Monga said.

Researchers at Google are trying to enhance video recognition. The company's researchers are studying how deep-learning could help robots with hand-eye coordination and learning through predictive video.

Google is making AI a big part of its cloud operations and using machine learning for Google Now, street mapping, and other services. Outside of Google, deep learning is also being used by self-driving cars to cruise the street safely. Companies are also using AI to

Elena Seibert

Khaled Hosseini, author of The Kite Runner and this year’s And the Mountains Echoed, reminded us that we can only approximate the book we want to write—the final product will never capture the excitement of initial inspiration. His tribute to Stephen King explained how he deals with that familiar disappointment.

You write because you have an idea in your mind that feels so genuine, so important, so true. And yet, by the time this idea passes through the different filters of your mind, and into your hand, and onto the page or computer screen—it becomes distorted, and it's been diminished. The writing you end up with is an approximation, if you're lucky, of whatever it was you really wanted to say. When this happens, it's quite a sobering reminder of your limitations as a writer. It can be extremely frustrating. When I'm writing, a thought will occasionally pass unblemished, unperturbed, through my head onto the screen—clearly, like through a glass. It's an intoxicating, euphoric sensation to feel that I've communicated something so real, and so true. But this doesn't happen often. (I can only think that there are some writers who write that way all the time. I think that's the difference between greatness and just being good.) Even my finished books are approximations of what I intended to do. I try to narrow the gap, as much as I possibly can, between what I wanted to say and what's actually on the page. But there's still a gap, there always is. It's very, very difficult. And it's humbling. But that's what art is for—for both reader and writer to overcome their respective limitations and encounter something true. It seems miraculous, doesn't it? That somebody can articulate something clearly and beautifully that exists inside you, something shrouded in impenetrable fog. Great art reaches through the fog, towards this secret heart—and it shows it to you, holds it before you. It's a revelatory, incredibly moving experience when this happens. You feel understood. You feel heard. That's why we come to art—we feel less alone. We are less alone. You see, through art, that others have felt the way you have—and you

In last night’s episode of Extant, Ethan went way beyond programming himself to dream. He is now, among other things, suddenly able to speak fluent JAPANESE! Also, he learns to ride a bike within seconds. It’s a whole big thing.

For the first time in his young robot life, he’s making decisions on his own, without being programmed to do so. John becomes increasingly concerned that Ethan is progressing too rapidly, thus veering away from his original plan for the little creep to be a normal member of (human) society. Hear that Ethan? You’re supposed to be a normal human-wannabe-robot NOT a lunatic-savant-human-robot hybrid destined to take over the world!

Luckily, everyone is realizing that the terrifying, saucer-eyed boy is dangerous and the whole episode features people trying to – both literally and figuratively– shut him down.

The first of which is my boyfriend…er, I mean, Julie’s boyfriend, Odin. While on a date with her new beau, Julie spills her guts about her office conflicts with John and her plans for Ethan. After revealing that she hopes Ethan will eventually be able to think completely on his own, Odin replies with only a (sexy but) villainous stare indicating –to all but Julie– that he will use this information against her. Which he later does, in a somewhat crazed rant to a team he and Ms. Fodds assembled. Adorned in a leather jacket and handsomely backlit (#swoon), he explains that he used to be a solider and lost his arm in the war. Seeking justice against the “machines” that killed his colleagues, he’s decided to begin the “revolution” by targeting Julie’s beloved prototype, Ethan (I kind of don’t know how the little creep has anything to do with the war but I like where he’s going with this).
