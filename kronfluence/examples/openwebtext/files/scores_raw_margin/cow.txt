The neighbors' dog will not stop barking.

He is barking the same high, rhythmic bark

that he barks every time they leave the house.

They must switch him on on their way out.

The neighbors' dog will not stop barking.

I close all the windows in the house

and put on a Beethoven symphony full blast

but I can still hear him muffled under the music,

barking, barking, barking,

and now I can see him sitting in the orchestra,

his head raised confidently as if Beethoven

had included a part for barking dog.

When the record finally ends he is still barking,

sitting there in the oboe section barking,

his eyes fixed on the conductor who is

entreating him with his baton

while the other musicians listen in respectful

silence to the famous barking dog solo,

that endless coda that first established

Beethoven as an innovative genius.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

I just felt like I wanted to upload something new. I have a bunch of ideas to type out and no motivation to type. I'm amazed I was even able to type this (even though it was short). I don't have this story sorted out yet. I only have the ending in my head lol…There shouldn't be too many grammatical errors either since I was able to do a mini read through cause it was short.

Enjoy ;). One of my favorite Pretty Cure couples.

Prologue: The end of King Jikochu

And that was it. Cure Heart's last move, My Sweet Heart, defeated Proto Jikochu as well as cleansing all the selfish psyches that were in him. Bel, after being overrun by King Jikochu's power and likewise being defeated, was weakened into the state of a mouse. Marmo, discovering his pathetic state, picked him up by his tail and sighed. "Look at you" she said.

"How pathetic" Ira commented.

"Whatever, I'll just sleep for 10,000 years again to build up my energy" Bel replied.

"Huh!? Another 10,000 years!?" Ira exclaimed. He turned to face where the Cures were sitting in the far distance.

"Oh well" he said as he started particularly at a blue haired girl laughing away. "They're still here."

"What are you doing?" Marmo asked bringing Ira back to reality. "Let's go" she said softy.

"I know" he replied. He got up and started to float towards Marmo who was flying away.

"I'm hungry" Bel commented.

"Just eat some leftovers" Ira replied as they all teleported away, back to their hideout.

'It's okay' Ira thought to himself as the teleportation started to bring them back. 'This was inevitable in the end.'

...

The three returned back to their hideout, the bowling alley. The hideout was their own dimension of space; only connecting to Trump Kingdom when they wanted. Now that Trump Kingdom was freed from King Jikochu's control, it wasn't safe for them to have it conveniently accessed by the citizens so they broke the connection.

Marmo immediately released Bel's tail when they returned. Being in his mouse form, Bel was able

But attempts to replicate this finding have left two groups of researchers at loggerheads, highlighting the problems faced by scientists working to replicate unusual findings based on new methods of data analysis.

Magneto-reception has been detected in animals from turtles to birds. Three years ago, Hynek Burda, a zoologist at the University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany, and his colleagues added cattle to the magnetic family with a paper in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The team used data from Google Earth to show that domestic cattle seem to prefer to align their bodies along Earth’s magnetic field lines1, and showed a similar phenomenon in field observations of deer.

E. ELISSEEVA/GLOWIMAGES.COM

A follow-up study by Burda and his colleagues showed no such alignment near electric power lines, which might be expected to disrupt magneto-sensing in cattle2.

Cow conundrum

Earlier this year, a group of Czech researchers reported their failed attempt to replicate the finding using different Google Earth images3. The Czech team wrote in the Journal of Comparative Physiology A: “Two independent groups participated in our study and came to the same conclusion that in contradiction to the recent findings of other researchers, no alignment of the animals and of their herds along geomagnetic field lines could be found.”

“When in 2008 the authors started to announce their surprising findings in [the] mass media, we got the impression that this is not the way science should be made and we took a closer look. We found out that it is not as fantastic as it was presented,” says Lukas Jelinek, a researcher in the electromagnetic-field department at the Czech Technical University in Prague and one of the authors of the replication attempt.

In response, Burda and his colleagues reanalysed the replication attempt by Jelinek and his colleagues4. Burda says that half of the Jelinek team's data should be excluded because some of the pastures are on slopes or near high-voltage power lines, for example, or because the images are too poor to make out cattle, or appear to contain hay bales or sheep instead. “One half of their data is just noise,” says Burda.

In addition, Burda's group looked at herds as a whole, whereas Jelinek’s team analysed individual cows. “Of the data that were useable, they looked only at

If decency fails to call out indecency? Were the shoe on the other foot, we Republicans—would we Republicans—meekly accept such behavior on display from dominant Democrats? Of course we wouldn’t, and we would be wrong if we did.

When we remain silent and fail to act when we know that that silence and inaction is the wrong thing to do—because of political considerations, because we might make enemies, because we might alienate the base, because we might provoke a primary challenge, because ad infinitum, ad nauseum—when we succumb to those considerations in spite of what should be greater considerations and imperatives in defense of the institutions and our liberty, we dishonor our principles and forsake our obligations. Those things are far more important than politics.

Now, I am aware that more politically savvy people than I will caution against such talk. I am aware that a segment of my party believes that anything short of complete and unquestioning loyalty to a president who belongs to my party is unacceptable and suspect.

If I have been critical, it is not because I relish criticizing the behavior of the president of the United States. If I have been critical, it is because I believe it is my obligation to do so, and as a matter of duty of conscience. The notion that one should stay silent as the norms and values that keep America strong are undermined and as the alliances and agreements that ensure the stability of the entire world are routinely threatened by the level of thought that goes into 140 characters—the notion that we should say and do nothing in the face of such mercurial behavior is ahistoric and, I believe, profoundly misguided.

A president—a Republican president—named Roosevelt had this to say about the president and a citizen’s relationship to the office:

“The President is merely the most important among a large number of public servants. He should be supported or opposed exactly to the degree which is warranted by his good conduct or bad conduct, his efficiency or inefficiency in rendering loyal, able, and disinterested service to the nation as a whole.” He continued, “Therefore, it is absolutely necessary that there should be full liberty to tell the truth about his acts, and this means that it is exactly as necessary to blame him when he does wrong as to praise him when he does right. Any other attitude in an American citizen is both base and servile.” President Roosevelt

Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Egyptians on Saturday cleared burned cars, garbage and debris that accumulated over 18 days at Tahrir Square, a sign that Cairo and the rest of the country were ready to rebuild and get back to work while the country formulates a plan for governance.

A day after President Hosni Mubarak stepped down, employees and businesses readied themselves for Sunday, the traditional start of the work week. The country's stock market is expected to reopen Wednesday.

Wael Ghonim, a cyberactivist who is a Google executive on leave, wrote Friday on his Twitter account, "Dear Egyptians, Go back to your work on Sunday, work like never before and help Egypt become a developed country."

Volunteers repainted black-and-white-striped street curbs around a monument by the Egyptian Museum, which had been on the front line in street battles between Mubarak's foes and supporters. Police were starting to move barricades and trying to restore vehicle traffic at Tahrir Square, where many protesters vowed to remain.

"It's time to start rebuilding the country," protester Yehya Kheireldin said, pointing to the hundreds of volunteers armed with brooms who are sweeping away the debris left by the sit-in.

In the immediate future, the military -- largely respected by Egyptians -- will have to grapple with guiding the country of more than 80 million people through the transition amid massive problems of unemployment and considerable economic underdevelopment, said CNN correspondent Ben Wedeman, who is based in Cairo.

Former Egyptian Trade Minister Rachid Mohammed Rachid recently told CNN that the new government must show it is business-friendly.

The African nation virtually shut down during the unrest, losing vital tourism dollars as well.

CNN's Nic Robertson reported Saturday that citizens who make their living off foreign tourists are angry.

"Young boys 17 years old and 18 years old, they want to say, 'We are hungry, we want to eat, we want to work,' " said businessman Ayman el Myonir.

Businessmen near the famed Pyramids say about 50,000 people are employed in the tourism industry, Robertson reported.

"We try to help each other. We would like to put our hands together, and to help each other," said el Myonir.

Sam sat with his eyes closed for several minutes, then said softly:

"I have many names, and none of them matter." He opened his eyes slightly then, but he did not move his head. He looked upon nothing in particular.

"Names are not important," he said. "To speak is to name names, but to speak is not important. A thing happens once that has never happened before. Seeing it, a man looks on reality. He cannot tell others what he has seen. Others wish to know, however, so they question him saying, 'What is it like, this thing you have seen?' So he tries to tell them. Perhaps he has seen the very first fire in the world. He tells them, 'It is red, like a poppy, but through it dance other colors. It has no form, like water, flowing everywhere. It is warm, like the sun of summer, only warmer. It exists for a time on a piece of wood, and then the wood is gone, as though it were eaten, leaving behind that which is black and can be sifted like sand. When the wood is gone, it too is gone.' Therefore, the hearers must think reality is like a poppy, like water, like the sun, like that which eats and excretes. They think it is like to anything that they are told it is like by the man who has known it. But they have not looked upon fire. They cannot really know it. They can only know of it. But fire comes again into the world, many times. More men look upon fire. After a time, fire is as common as grass and clouds and the air they breathe. They see that, while it is like a poppy, it is not a poppy, while it is like water, it is not water, while it is like the sun, it is not the sun, and while it is like that which eats and passes wastes, it is not that which eats and passes wastes, but something different from each of these apart or all of these together. So they look upon this new thing and they make a new word to call it. They call it 'fire.'

"If they come upon one who still has not seen it and they speak to him of fire, he does not know what they mean. So they, in turn, fall back upon telling him what fire is like. As they do, they know from their own experience that what they are telling him is

It’s true, short-term weight loss is possible for most people. However, after the body loses a certain amount of weight, a variety of compensatory mechanisms kick into high gear to restore us to what is known as our “set point weight”. Our set point weight is actually a range of 15-20 pounds where each individual’s body feels happiest, and it occurs when you eat intuitively, when you are hungry, and according to your signals of hunger and fullness.

Essentially, as we lose weight, our body realizes, “whoa, I’m starving!” and it does everything it can to gain weight to the point where it feels comfortable again. Just like our bodies maintain homeostasis with regard to things like our internal temperature, they also like to maintain our weight.

1 Our bodies fight against us the moment they see our weight shift significantly lower. These weight loss-induced compensatory mechanisms, which are orchestrated by a part of our brain known as the hypothalamus, are the reason why in a major meta-analysis of dieting studies, the average amount of weight lost was a mere 0.9 kg.Our bodies fight against us the moment they see our weight shift significantly lower.

2 (It’s also valuable to note that the average weight lost in dieting studies is likely artificially high, due to most weight loss studies having major design flaws. Factors in this include subject selection biases, people dropping out due to the shame of weight gain, poor data gathering, and people going on multiple diets in succession!)

Read on to understand each of them in more detail.

When you diet to lose weight…

1) Your brain notices food more. 3 Kinda cruel, isn’t it? But it’s true: when you are depriving yourself of food, your brain actually starts to notice food more. Not only that — your brain pays more attention to the food when it comes across it. This is all done by the amazing hypothalamus and a variety of hormones.

2) Your tastes change so more foods are appealing. Dieting even leads to our hypothalamus to change the way we perceive tastes so a wider variety of food is appealing. 4 It can also make you want high fat food more, because fat contains more calories than other macronutrients.

3) Your appetite increases & you feel less satiated when you eat.

If nature and nurture have worked their magic, she’ll laugh. And then I’ll tell this tale.

My wife and I married in August 2011. We were each 33, an age when last calls are less important than waking up for work. We were two peas in a pod, ready for a third. In your thirties, making a baby is not as simple as throwing a fifth of Beam in the backseat of a car, removing your pants, and taking a ride to kingdom come. Time was required. Months disappeared. Our spirits lagged, beleaguered by one negative pregnancy test after another. After trying for some time, copulation becomes obligation. Beer helps. Oh, does it help.

One morning, after drinking myself into a state of disrepair, I awoke to a scream. Our dog barked bloody murder. “We’re pregnant!” my wife shouted, her words bringing pain and pleasure. Nine months later our daughter, Violet, debuted.

Alcohol is not an ideal coping technique. But damn, does a beer feel mighty good after changing a diaper.

To celebrate, I drank a Sierra Nevada Celebration. It was not the last one I drank in my daughter’s presence.

Having a child does not bathe your life in rainbows and magic-hour sunlight. After two days in the hospital (if that long!), you’re sent home with a wailing infant and simple instructions: Don’t shake the baby. You wonder why the nurses repeat that command, over and over…until your child will not stop screaming, and then you get it. You want to shake the baby. A million dollars to stop screaming! But you do not shake the baby. Instead, you soothe her and calmly drink beer.

Well, at least I drink beer. As a beer journalist and author, I have a built-in excuse. Research. It’s always for research, no matter if I have a deadline or a howling daughter. The howls. They are for several very good reasons. My daughter is hungry. She has a dirty diaper. She wants to be held. She’s tired. She doesn’t like that thing, which it is our job as parents to deduce, Sherlock-style.

<|begin_of_text|>CLARK COUNTY, NV (The Las Vegas Review-Journal) – A 15-year-old boy charged in the gang rape of a 14-year-old special education student will be prosecuted in the adult justice system, a Clark County Family Court judge ruled Wednesday.

The teen, Leby Urquilla, is one of four boys charged, and the only juvenile to be certified as an adult as of Wednesday. Two adults are also jailed in connection with the case: Jose Mejia-Henriquez, 18, and the boy’s father, Leby Alas-Gomez, 39.

The victim, who has the mental capacity of a 7- or 8-year-old, told police she was sexually assaulted by at least six males on three separate occasions in November. The accusations came to light after a video depicting the girl being used in group sex acts began circulating around Del Sol Academy in December.

“They treated this special needs girl like a piece of cattle or property, to do with what they wanted,” Chief Deputy District Attorney Kimberly Adams said Wednesday in a small juvenile courtroom.

She called the acts “heinous and egregious” while arguing for Urquilla to be tried as an adult.

Urquilla sat silently as a court interpreter translated Adams’ words into Spanish, often looking down at his lap, then at the judge.

A key piece of evidence — one of the videos shared throughout the high school — captured part of one gang rape incident, Adams said.

In the footage, the girl can be seen trying to get up while being sexually assaulted, but “they would push her back down,” Adams said.

“She repeatedly said to stop, but they don’t,” she said. “She tries to cross her legs while on her stomach, but (Urquilla) separates them.”

The victim was not at the hearing Wednesday, but her mother wiped away a tear as Adams continued, describing Urquilla as a calculated predator and the girl as “one of the most vulnerable victims of our society.”

“It appears she was used and groomed by (Urquilla),” Adams said. The girl initially liked Urquilla and wanted to fit in; she often ate lunch with the boys at school. But the relationship was about control, Adams argued.

“If he said he was hungry, she would give him her lunch,” she said. “Eventually (Urquilla) began to invite (the victim) to his apartment, and initially, she would say no. And then, after several times, she finally said OK.”

Mahā Moggallāna were staying in Pigeon Cave. Then, on a moonlit night, Ven. Sāriputta — his head newly shaven — was sitting in the open air, having attained a certain level of concentration.

And on that occasion two yakkhas who were companions were flying from north to south on some business or other. They saw Ven. Sāriputta — his head newly shaven — sitting in the open air. Seeing him, the first yakkha said to the second, "I'm inspired to give this contemplative a blow on the head."

When this was said, the second yakkha said to the first, "Enough of that, my good friend. Don't lay a hand on the contemplative. He's an outstanding contemplative, of great power & great might."

It's understandable, as people always like to take a stand, but it's not understandable why you take their side - the children on Israel side are bleeding just the same. It's true that in terms of numbers, more people suffer on their side. It's a simple matter of population density, human shield factors, and fire power. Don't mistake me, I feel sorry for them. I just feel more sorry for my family, my neighbours and friends and country first. It seems you don't.

"The renowned Israeli historian revisits the formative period of the State of Israel. Between 1947 and 1949, over 400 Palestinian villages were deliberately destroyed, civilians were massacred, and around a million men, women, and children were expelled from their homes at gunpoint. Denied for almost six decades, had it happened today it could only have been called "ethnic cleansing". Decisively debunking the myth that the Palestinian population left of their own accord in the course of this war, Ilan Pappe offers impressive archival evidence to demonstrate that, from its very inception, a central plank in Israel's founding ideology was the forcible removal of the indigenous population. This book is indispensable for anyone interested in the Middle East."

"If I knew it was possible to save all the children in Germany by taking them to England, and only half of the children by taking them to Eretz Israel, I would choose the second solution. For we must take into account not only the lives of these children but also the history of the people of Israel."

Hard-partying Andy Dick vowed to stay sober during his recent stint on “Dancing With the Stars.” But once the comic was eliminated, it seems all bets were off.

Dick was partying his way through the Hamptons last weekend, sources said, and even took one poor soul who tried to help him on a wild escapade.

We’re told Dick was at a bash in East Hampton Friday looking “incredibly intoxicated.” When a friend he’d arrived with disappeared, a spy saw the former “NewsRadio” star visibly “upset.”

“He didn’t know where he was staying,” our source explained. “He had no cellphone or wallet.” A woman offered to take Dick to her place — “Big mistake,” she told us, adding that on the way, Dick “grabbed the steering wheel” as she drove, and blasted her radio.

But things were about to get much worse. “When we got to the house, [Andy] told my husband he was hungry,” the good Samaritan told us. “My husband made him eggs. [But] Andy spat at me because I could not put a song he requested on my iPod quickly enough. He kept asking... if I was a moron.”

Then, “He grabbed my breast and said, ‘You’re so hot. I would [bleep] the [bleep] out of you!” When his advances were rebuked, openly bisexual Dick grabbed the crotch of the woman’s husband and tried to kiss him, she said.

The couple told Dick to sleep it off for a few hours. When the exasperated wife took him back to the party to see if he could find his friend, he grabbed beers from her fridge to drink on the way, despite her objections. When she dropped him off, “He asked me if he could borrow 20 bucks!” She didn’t hand over any dough. “He is a tortured soul,” she said.

Spies saw Dick the next day at Surf Lodge crashing a Beach magazine party, peeing in a bush at the swanky spot and being asked to leave.

Dick’s most recent rehab stint was last year, when the staff of “Andy Dick Live!” staged an intervention. His reps did not respond to repeated requests for comment.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

It’s a little shock, followed by a moment of snoozing.

Shortly after comes the feeling that something isn’t right, you wake up a little more and figure out things are okay after all, and return to peaceful snoozing.

Not today. Not fucking today.

Oh sure, most of it was the same as every other time, but then I realized that what I saw was not my nightstand, nor the cabinet on the other wall.

From what I could see I was in a hospital room.

I was drunk yesterday but not to the point that I blacked out.

I remember standing up from behind my computer at two in the morning, walking to the toilet and emptying my bladder while leaning on the wall.

Heck, I even remember crawling up the stairs and into bed next to my wife. Did I have an accident overnight?

I tried to get up on my elbows, only to be shocked that they were not where I expected them to be.

I moved my hand up to my face and smashed it against my nose.

The big shock came when I tried to move my arm again, more careful this time, and saw a little hand.

A baby’s hand. What was this?

I tried to talk and all I could manage was a soft cry, almost a whimper.

I screamed and the cry got louder, but this was not my voice.

My heart felt like an ice cold hand took hold of it and my throat froze up to the point that I could not swallow.

For a moment I believed I was in a nightmare and could wake up every second now, but none such thing happened.

I tried to get up but kept failing time after time. I tried to roll around and kick but my legs were firmly bound inside a blanket.

At last, I kept screaming. I screamed till my throat hurt and my eyes were full of tears.

I don’t know for how long I screamed but after some time I saw a nurse walking towards me.

As she came closer I stopped screaming and she started talking:

“Hey buddy, what a smart little fellow you are! Are you hungry? Let’s go see your mother!”.

My surroundings began to move and it took me a moment to realize I was actually in a baby bed on wheels, a plastic tub with a mattress in it.

We drove past other little beds on wheels and into a long hallway.

We were stopped a few times by people telling me that I was cute

Speaking at a National Prayer Breakfast unlike most before it, President Trump on Thursday said the nation has to be "tougher" in dealing with other countries, pledged to make it easier for religious groups to engage in politics — and asked the crowd to pray for his successor as host of The Apprentice.

"The ratings went down the tubes" since Arnold Schwarzenegger took over as host of his former program, Trump said. "It's been a total disaster... And I want to just pray for Arnold, if we can, for those ratings, OK?"

Schwarzenegger responded by Twitter, offering to switch jobs with Trump so that "people can finally sleep comfortably again." The former California governor headlined his tweet, "The National Prayer Breakfast?"

In his remarks at the breakfast, Trump constantly referenced himself, talking at one point about how people often greet him with five words that warm his heart: "I am praying for you." He also said "so many faith leaders" have been "very, very important people to me."

At another point, Trump referenced foreign policy, telling members of the prayer breakfast not to worry about reports of his "tough" phone calls with world leaders.

"We're (being) taken advantage of by every nation in the world, virtually," Trump said. "It's not going to happen anymore."

Read more:

Trump also defended his temporary ban on travel to the United States from seven Muslim majority nations, calling it a counter-terrorism measure. He suggested, as he did during the campaign, that future migrants may be given some sort of test to demonstrate their commitment to American values.

The administration is developing "a system to help ensure that those admitted into our country fully embrace our values of religious and personal liberty, and that they reject any form of oppression and discrimination. We want people to come into our nation, but we want people to love us and to love our values, not to hate us and to hate our values."

During the foreign policy discussion, Trump said: "The world is in trouble, but we can straighten it out, OK? That's what I do — I fix things."

IT was only a matter of time. Plants have begun texting for help. Thanks to clever new digital devices, a dry philodendron, undernourished hibiscus, or sadly neglected wandering Jew can send its owner a text or Twitter message. Humans like to feel appreciated, so a begonia may also send a simple “Thank-you” text — when it’s happy, as gardeners like to say, meaning healthy and well-tended. Picture your Boston fern home alone placing Botanicalls. But why should potted plants be the only ones to reassure their humans? Another company has found a way for crops to send text messages in unison, letting their farmer know if she’s doing a good enough job to deserve a robust harvest. What is the sound of one hand of bananas clapping? Probes monitoring the soil can send a range of prerecorded messages specific to each plant’s needs.

Ping Zhu

Plants texting humans may be new, but malcontent plants have always been chatting among themselves. When an elm tree is being attacked by insects, it does the chemical equivalent of broadcasting “I’m hurt! You could be next!” alerting others in its grove to whip up some dandy poisons.

If a human kills with poison, we label it a wicked and premeditated crime, one no plea of “self-defense” can excuse. But plants dish out their nastiest potions every day, and we wholeheartedly forgive them. They may lack minds, or even brains, but they do react to injury, fight to survive, act purposefully, enslave giants (through the likes of coffee, tobacco, opium), and gab endlessly among themselves.

Strawberry, bracken, clover, reeds, bamboo, ground elder and lots more all grow their own social networks — delicate runners (really horizontal stems) linking a grove of individuals. If a caterpillar chews on a white clover leaf, the message races through the colony, which ramps up its chemical weaponry. Stress a walnut tree and it will brew its own caustic aspirin and warn its relatives to do the same. Remember Molly Ivins’s needle-witted quip about a Texas Congressman: “If his I.Q. slips any lower, we’ll have to water him twice a day”? She clearly misjudged the acumen of plants. Plants are not mild-mannered.

But police arrested and jailed the woman, identified as Ashley Whisman, 26, of the city's West End, for what they allegedly found inside toys belonging to the woman's three-year-old child. Namely, drugs and drug paraphernalia.

NorthlandsNewsCenter.com reports that police said Whisman's speech was slurred, her arms were covered in track marks, scratches and lesions. On her way to the hospital, police said she tried to hide a baggie of marijuana and a needle, the website adds.

The 3-year-old allegedly told EMS he was very hungry, the station reports. And among the child's toys, police found drug paraphernalia, marijuana bongs, grinders and even syringes, the website writes.

<|begin_of_text|>WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Three men alleged to be prominent Russian spies inexplicably gained access to the Oval Office last week and held a high-level meeting there, according to reports.

Eyewitnesses to the meeting said that the three Russian agents spoke at length and shared sensitive intelligence material, at times laughing uproariously.

After approximately an hour, the meeting broke up, with two of the spies leaving the Oval Office and the third remaining behind.

News that agents of the Russian Federation had somehow eluded the Secret Service in order to hold a meeting in the Oval Office sent shock waves through Washington on Monday evening.

“The fact that three well-known Russian agents were able to hold a meeting in the Oval Office suggests that something has seriously broken down,” Harland Dorrinson, a national-security official who served in the Reagan and Bush Administrations, said. “None of these three men should be anywhere near the White House.”

On Capitol Hill, House Speaker Paul Ryan called the meeting of the three Russian spies at the White House “a tempest in a teapot” and “much ado about nothing,” before adding, off-microphone, “I am screwed. I am so screwed.”<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Pope Francis criticized Catholics who live a double life, suggesting that it is better to be an atheist than a hypocritical Christian.

Francis made the comments Thursday during his private morning mass at his home in Casa Santa Marta in Vatican City.

"Scandal is saying one thing and doing another; it is a double life," he told attendees, according to a transcription from Vatican Radio.

He continued:

"‘I am very Catholic, I always go to mass, I belong to this association and that one; but my life is not Christian, I don’t pay my workers a just wage, I exploit people, I am dirty in my business, I launder money …’ A double life. And so many Christians are like this, and these people scandalize others. How many times have we heard — all of us, around the neighbourhood and elsewhere — ‘but to be a Catholic like that, it’s better to be an atheist.’"

Francis' comments followed his mass readings, which included a passage from the Gospel of Mark that read, "If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off."

The day before he made the comments, the Pope tweeted the gates of heaven should be open, not closed.

Jesus entrusted to Peter the keys to open the entrance to the kingdom of heaven, and not to close it. — Pope Francis (@Pontifex) February 22, 2017

It's not the first time the Pope has suggested atheists shouldn't be seen as sinners if they do good.

In 2013, shortly after he his papacy began, Francis hinted during a mass that non-believers can be redeemed as long as they "do good."

However, some atheists poked fun at the Pope's remarks.

Reminder that the Pope thinks atheists are only one step up from the worst of practicing Christians. Proud atheist 💪 https://t.co/DdPVRSOlLF — Max Lynch (@maxlynch) February 23, 2017

<|begin_of_text|>In the fantastic realm there are hundreds of dangerous creatures, among them we find the giant spiders. Arachnids that get as big as a tree. Most of them dangerous and aggressive, but at the same time most of them are not a direct threat to humans. But there's one of them that makes theexception.The Battered Wife, as originally named. Oras called by the common folk. Why? because this creature will destroy your throat before you can sayThe Battered Wife is a spider that chose populated cities as its natural habitat. Thousands of years of refined evolution have created the perfect disguise on which this arachnid can prey on its preferred target. Humans. The Battered Wife as the exact resemblance of a young woman in a long dress with a hood. But that's not why it's the most dangerous creature of the alley. It's because she not only looks like a hurt lady in distress, but can actually act like one. This spider doesn't talk, but moans exactly as someone that just got stabbed in the stomach. It also recreates the same posture and it shivers as someone scared to death. The Battered Wife is a basic creature with the wits of any other animal. But that little brain has the enough intelligence to use hair and blood from its last victim to get the realism it wants.The Battered Wife nests in the sewers or abandoned houses, it can live to 30 years and spawn every 6 years hundreds of eggs. This means that one single female can spawn over 3 thousand spiders in its life time. The Battered Wife feeds only on humans and as it grows it eats absolutely nothing until it reaches full maturity and can be able to hunt. In between that, almost all of the little spiders die from other predators or starve before they get to kill anything. So that's why this hardly gets as a plague and will never become a threat to our specie. The only big problem is (as this b*tch isn't already one) that its growth is extremely fast. In a few months it can get to full size. And since it hasn't eaten anything and it's hungry, it will make the best performance ever in order to eat a full grown man.The rumor tells that there's a crazy scientist around that experiments on animals, and one of them was a Battered Wife he altered into a different breed. They call it The Battered Mother in Law. Why? Because the motherf*cker has wings... and flies. But luckly for us

Enlarge this image toggle caption Amr Nabil/AP Amr Nabil/AP

At the huge weekly market on the outskirts of Cairo, live chickens crowd wooden cages next to tables piled with ruby-red pomegranates, deep-orange persimmons and baskets of fresh dates from the countryside.

But as Egypt endures its worst economic crisis in decades, many shoppers can barely afford the tomatoes and cucumbers that are a staple of the poor. They hurry past to a nearby square in the hope of buying cartons of government-subsidized food.

Egypt is the Arab world's most populous country, with more than 90 million people, and one of the world's biggest food importers. The protests that swept Egypt and the Arab world five years ago and frightened off foreign investors and tourists collided with decades of a deeply inefficient, state-controlled economy.

After the Egyptian government loosened exchange rates this month, the official value of the Egyptian pound plunged by almost half. One U.S. dollar bought less than nine Egyptian pounds before the devaluation, and these days buys more than 17 pounds. That means that anything imported — from sugar to medicine — became much more expensive and many items disappeared from the market.

"I went to all the shops and even if you can afford to buy sugar you can't find it," says Saleh Attiya, a furniture maker out shopping with his son.

"A kid like that — how will he drink his milk without sugar?" he said, pointing to 6-year-old son, also named Saleh. Attiya the father freely admits that his own missing teeth could be due to his habit of drinking each small glass of tea with four or five spoons of sugar. But for millions of Egypt's poor, sugar has been the only luxury they could afford.

To ease the hardship of rising prices and broad subsidy cuts required by a $12 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund, the Egyptian government sent the army into neighborhoods with 8 million food boxes at bargain prices. Egypt's official figures indicate almost one-third of Egyptians are in poverty, defined as living on about $50 a month or less.

Near the weekly market, a crowd of Egyptians, many of them elderly, crowded around a truck with subsidized food packages for sale. They sold out within minutes, leaving people shouting, "I want a carton!" and holding up tattered bills even as soldiers slammed shut the doors of the empty truck.

The lucky ones walked away with a cardboard

<|begin_of_text|>If Amazon's voice-powered Alexa devices were a bit more introspective, it would be fascinating to ask them why they're so popular. After all, geniuses world-wide have tried for decades to meld speech and artificial intelligence. It's a daunting task, yet Amazon has nailed the full package.

By its own tally, Amazon has sold "tens of millions" of Echoes, Dots and other Alexa devices since coming to market in late 2014. In May, a top consumer-technology researcher, Bob O'Donnell of Technalysis Research, estimated that Amazon has won 70.9% market share in what he calls the smart-speaker sector.

Time to peek behind the curtain. After interviewing a variety of Amazon Alexa insiders at both the company's Seattle headquarters and its Cambridge, Mass., research hub, I pieced together an analysis of Alexa's edge in an MIT Technology Review magazine article.

<|begin_of_text|>Whether we know it or not, we are all of us, all the time, oppressed by the kind of power exercised, ostensibly at least, in the name of organising society and holding it together. When I think about “power” in this sense – of a vaguely oppressive force bearing down upon me – it’s easy to ignore its encroachment, or to brush any such nagging feelings aside and decide that my unease is a collateral price for other freedoms. This is lethal to the human person.

Oppression of this kind is not something distant, but ever-present in my psyche and body. Much of it may well seem necessary, but sometimes it crosses a line. And the experiencing of that intrusion may in each of us arise differently: for one, in a “big” thing; for another, in a “small” thing. It’s always personal. Freedom is not necessarily epic. Only in the “I” – the absolute subjectivity which is my only accurate apparatus of judgment – can this be decided. No one else can make this decision for me.

There are no small freedoms, but one great freedom, spread over the totality of a life in reality.

In his essay The Power of the Powerless, Vaclav Havel took for granted this idea that freedom is not a matter of the absence of tanks in the streets.

Havel was not, as is sometimes suggested, merely an “anti-communist” writer and intellectual whose work relates to one period of history. His themes, always, were universal, timeless, though demonstrated in a specific political and ideological context. His subject, really, was the soul of man under any kind of system seeking to extinguish it.

A central motif of The Power of the Powerless is the story of the greengrocer required by the governing ideology to place a sign in his shop window bearing the slogan: “Workers of the World, Unite”. The sign, Havel observes, might just as easily read: “I am afraid and therefore unquestioningly obedient”, but this would cause the greengrocer to lose face. The message relates to the reigning ideology, which nobody really believes in, but its unquestioning promulgation becomes, for the greengrocer, both an outward show of loyalty and a way of saving face. By displaying the sign, the greengrocer has shown his willingness to enter into the prescribed ritual of pretence, colluding in his own enslavement, acquiescing in the “blind automatism which drives

"He was completely naked, he was hiding himself with a little napkin," she said, describing 93-year-old Royal Racine, a Second World War veteran.

"He was soaked in urine."

Royal Racine had recently been hospitalized with pneumonia for the eighth time and cried out to the family, "I'm freezing," as they entered the room Oct. 19, she recalled.

In addition to suffering pneumonia, the elderly man is incontinent and in the early stages of dementia.

Emmanuelle Racine said she started to cry when she arrived at Gatineau Hospital Oct. 19 to find her 93-year-old grandfather naked, soiled and uncovered. (Radio-Canada)

'How can they treat him like that'

The nursing staff the family tracked down complained about missing personnel and told them he'd been left naked and uncovered for more than an hour, Emmanuelle Racine told Radio-Canada in a recent interview.

"I started to cry because I was like, how can they treat him like that, you know?" she said.

Royal Racine is being treated for pneumonia at Gatineau Hospital and is due to be released Friday. (CBC)

And it wasn't the first time she'd found her grandfather soiled with no covers, she added.

On another visit just days earlier on Oct. 14, she smelled the urine and waste before walking through the door, she said.

When Royal Racine saw his granddaughter and son, Marcel Racine, he said, "Why are they doing this to me?" Emmanuelle Racine remembered.

'What happens when we're not there?'

On that occasion, nurses confirmed to the family Royal Racine had been left without covers or clothes since supper about two hours earlier, Marcel Racine said.

The family has been reluctant to launch a formal complaint with the hospital while Royal Racine is still a patient there, out of fear his care will worsen.

Instead, Marcel Racine wrote an email to Quebec Health Minister Gaétan Barrette, along with photos of his father, imploring the minister to investigate. The family has since received a response saying their letter was received.

Emmanuelle Racine also took photos of her grandfather at the hospital on Oct. 14. (Emmanuelle Racine)

Women got i nto altercation outside La ganside Cou rt in Belfast

One woman in her 20's was with a baby in a pram at the time

Security guard had to drag the pair apart and court staff took one inside

Two women pulled each others hair, scratched and drew blood during a fight outside a court in Belfast.

The violent altercation began after the unidentified pair, who are thought to have known each other, clashed outside Laganside Court in the Northern Irish capital.

A security guard had to step in to separate the two women, who had each other in a fierce hold, before court staff escorted one inside for her own protection.

Fierce: The older woman pulled on the other females hair during the violent altercation Pain: The red-haired woman tries to wriggle away from the grasp of the attacker Grab: The older woman goes for the throat of the mother, who was looking after her baby at the time

One of the women, said to be in her 20s, was walking her young child in a pram alongside a male friend who allegedly shouted 'I am going to stamp on your son's head' to the other woman, said to be in her 40s.

The older woman then ran over, grabbed her younger opponent and began to pull her hair.

She then managed to draw blood before a security guard was forced to drag the pair apart.

A witness outside the court said: 'One of the women was in her 40's and the other was in her 20's, it looked like they knew each other.

'The woman with the red hair had a pram with a young baby inside.

'A man she was with then shouted something like "I am going to stamp on your son's head".

Hold: A security guard was forced to intervene and managed to separate the pair Injury: The red-haired woman was escorted into the court building with blood dripping from her eyebrow Gesture: The woman pointed at her opponent as she walked away from the scene

'It was all over very quickly, security guards rushed in to break them up.'

An ambulance was called to the scene, but the women had left before it arrived.

Photographers captured the scrap while they covered the case of Marian McGlinchey, the Old Bailey bomber.

A spokesman for the Police Service of Northern Ireland confirmed there had been an incident and added that

Confined within his Lady's house, however, the young fellow is deprived of the opportunity to hunt live prey. The mansion is a sterile playground for a predator; offering nothing more than furniture which allows itself to be brutalized far too easily. The ambitious cat is bored and hungry for a challenge.

Kitten learns of a passage hidden in his Lady's library: the Door, which leads to an unknown world. The cat has been told that the source of all evil dwells openly in this place. The feline is eager to fight the sinister personage and goes through the Door with no hesitation.

The tabby finds himself in what appears to be a forest like any other in England. It doesn't take long for him to learn that this is a very different place.

Written in the style of classic fantasies, this novel can be appreciated on different levels. To some readers, it's an allegorical tale: thought-provoking and filled with symbolism. To others, it's an adventure-filled page-turner.

IF KIM Jong-Il has an imaginative public relations office, he'll issue a statement that setting off another nuclear weapon was due to a simple mistake as he was confused about which missile he'd registered as his second one, and it was all within the rules, but he's sorry if anyone's upset and it goes to show this ghastly system needs to be jolly well reformed.

This would be more plausible than the now-famous interview by the member of parliament who protested that complaints about his expenses were driven by "jealousy" because his house "looks like Balmoral" and "does me nicely," ending with a flourish by snarling, "What right has the public to interfere in my private life? None."

AMY GOODMAN: President Donald Trump says he’ll make his announcement today on whether to pull the United States out of the landmark Paris climate accord, a decision environmentalists warn would be a crime against the future of the planet and humanity. On Twitter, Trump said he would make the announcement at 3:00 p.m. Eastern time in the White House Rose Garden, and ended his tweet with, quote, ”MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”

In 2015, nearly 200 nations agreed in Paris to the global accord to curb rising greenhouse gas emissions blamed for warming the planet. The climate pact was heralded as a rare moment of international collaboration to avert imminent climate disaster. Now The Guardian is reporting China and the European Union plan to forge an alliance to take a leading role in tackling climate change, in response to Trump’s expected decision to pull out of the agreement. The new alliance will reportedly focus on leading the energy transition toward a low-carbon economy. An early draft of the announcement from the two countries describes climate change as a national security issue and multiplying factor of social and political fragility.

On Wednesday in Brussels, Belgium, members of the European Parliament booed reports that Trump will likely pull the U.S. out of the Paris accord. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the administration will have a hard time withdrawing.

JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER: [translated] That’s not how it works. The Americans can’t just leave the climate protection agreement. Mr. Trump believes that, because he doesn’t get close enough to the dossiers to fully understand them. It would take three to four years after the agreement came into force in November 2016 to leave the agreement. So this notion—”I am Trump, I am American, America first, and I am going to get out of it”—that won’t happen.

AMY GOODMAN: On Wednesday, the United Nations tweeted, “Climate change is undeniable. Climate action is unstoppable. Climate solutions provide opportunities that are unmatchable.” As the world awaits Trump’s final decision, leaders from Brussels to Beijing reaffirmed their commitment to implement the Paris climate accord, and urged the United States not to become a global pariah. This is the German ambassador to the U.S., Peter Wittig, speaking to the PBS NewsHour.

Why is the rat population in our major cities growing so quickly? Earth cheesification is providing more rat food. Why have there been so many earthquakes lately? The cheesification of the tectonic plates has made them less resistant to sudden shifts. Why are glaciers melting? The freezing point of cheddar cheese is lower than that of water; as the Earth at the poles undergoes cheesification, the unfrozen cheese is causing a slight warming of the ice sheets from below, resulting in unusual levels of melting.

Then we would be at liberty to publish headlines such as this : “Research suggests warmer summers could be causing colder winters.” This conjecture, brought to you via the magical theory of global climate change, is reported as though it is the most plausible explanation of the peculiar fact that Canadian winters do not appear to be getting any warmer.

If, however, we could devise a theory that might literally be able to repel absolutely any possible counter-evidence, then we would have accomplished something truly diabolical: an unfalsifiable theory. If we could indeed devise such a theory, then we could run wild explaining anything and everything, and absorb absolutely any eventuality, without ever needing to question our faith in the underlying hypothesis.

I could go on like this for a long time, I suppose. At some point, however, you would confront me with some natural fact that I could not logically account for by means of my cheese theory. In other words, even the greatest faith in this underlying assumption could never withstand all possible evidence.

Question you aren’t supposed to ask: Why is the non-warming of recent winters a peculiar fact in need of an explanation? After all, did anyone in the past harbor any presumption that winters ought to be getting warmer? Why should they? The difference, of course, is that in the age of global warming, everyone is supposed to know, beyond any doubt, that the Earth is indeed getting significantly warmer. Thus, every time someone casually observes that the weather is pretty chilly, or that there has been a lot of snow, all hearers in the room look at their hands awkwardly, smirk bemusedly, or display some other symptom of that feeling familiar to anyone who has had to face doubts about a deeply held religious belief: “But this just can’t be true, because if it is, then my world is about to crumble.”

On Monday, following an intensifying attack by the forces of President Bashar al-Assad, Fatemah tweeted that she had been injured when her home was bombed the night before and that her family is now "on the run."

She also shared that her daughter was frightened for her life. The tweet came a day after a photo of a dust-covered and clearly shocked Bana was also posted.

Later Monday, the account posted: "We have no home now. I got minor injury. I didn't sleep since yesterday, I am hungry. I want to live, I don't want to die. — Bana."

Fatemah later told NBC News' Richard Engel Monday night that they were relatively safe at a friends house and Bana was sleeping.

"She didn’t sleep last night and all the day because there is always bomb and warplane in the sky," Fatemah said of her daughter.

"Aleppo is bleeding, really it’s bleeding, Aleppo it's suffering very much," she said.

"We are under siege for some three months... the people here are suffering from hunger, and now they are suffering from bombs, they don’t know how... how they deal with this, this, inhumanity," she added.

Jon and Sansa are setting out to liberate the north, without the aid of Littlefinger (although I have a feeling the Knights of the Vale won’t be packing up and heading home just yet). Arya has a new assignment at Assassin Academy, which still feels middling, but that’s alright. And things took a turn for the crazy pants up at Holy Tree Fort where Bran pulled a bonehead move that brought the Undead Army down around everyone’s ears. The big revelation, however, was the simultaneous origin and fate of Hodor and- stop looking at me, I’m not crying, you’re crying, stupid jerk-face with your face of a jerk.

The nurse tells the children elsewhere that if they are vaccinated with the MMR they won’t get the Measles, Mumps and Rubella. Will it hurt asks the boy, well it might says DR Ranj, but you can cry if you want to. Without waiting for an OK, the doc injects the boy who says “I am not ready for my ‘jection”, but the doc marvels“I have already done it”. (sic)

Even if you didn’t see the TV show described above – and I didn’t – you probably sense the writer of that description didn’t approve of it and you probably won’t be surprised that the doctor and infant in question looked something like this:

In case you missed it, only one of the characters in the above pic is real and he is a real-life medical doctor, Dr Ranj. The CBeebies Get Well Soon series is aimed at pre-school children. According to comments from parents about the series on the Dr Ranj fb page, toddlers love the show, which is intended to “help children understand their bodies and to see the medical world as an environment in which they feel safe”. (Source)

The series has covered a range of uncontroversial conditions like verruccae, constipation and conjunctivitis. I was unaware of it until I got wind of some 60 or so complaints to the BBC about the content of an episode called, Inject to Project. Cue much bristling and hissing from those who say,

“Vaccination is the longest running hoax perpetrated by Allopathy, the most pernicious, and the most dangerous thing that your children will ever face.”

That quote appears on many websites, including the one called ‘Arnica UK Parents Support Network’, which is run by Anna Watson, who authored the above passage and who is apparently spearheading the campaign to complain about the show.

Anna challenges whether it is legal “to promote medicines to children suggesting that they are 100% safe” and whether it is ethical “to promote medicines to children suggesting that they are 100% effective”.

This presumably refers to the bit where the show’s ‘Nurse Morag’ is telling a group of infants that the MMR jabs will stop them getting the measles, mumps and rubella, not the bit where the

Donald Trump once called the Rev. Al Sharpton "a con man," meaning that Sharpton plays the race card less out of sincerity and more as a method to make demands and extract concessions.

But has there ever been a bigger legislative con man than the soon-to-be-retired Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., currently the second-longest serving member of the House? His glossary of race-baiting is exhaustive. Just a few examples:

In criticizing the Republican-run house, Rangel said, "It's not'spic' or 'n-----' anymore. (Instead) they say, 'Let's cut taxes.'"

In accusing the then-President of racism, Rangel said "George (W.) Bush is our Bull Connor" (referring to the racist Southern lawman who sicced dogs and turned water hoses on civil rights marchers).

In accusing the Republican Party in general of racism, Rangel said, "Everything we believe in, everything we believe in, (Republicans) hate. They don't disagree -- they hate.... Some of them believe that slavery isn't over and that they won the Civil War."

On the tea party, Rangel said: "(Obama) really thought -- and maybe it was the water they drink at Harvard -- that he could deal with the tea party. They are mean, racist people. Now why do I say that? Because in those red states, they're the same slaveholding states -- they had the Confederate flag. They became Dixiecrats -- they had the Confederate flag. They're now the tea party."

And: "(The tea party) is the same group we faced in the South with those white crackers and the dogs and the police. They didn't care about how they looked. It was just fierce indifference to human life that caused America to say enough is enough. 'I don't want to see it and I am not a part of it.' What the hell?! If you have to bomb little kids and send dogs out against human beings, give me a break."

Yet now as the clock winds down on his career, Rangel is free -- free to tell the truth about "race." Rangel, in assessing why Hillary Clinton lost the race to Donald Trump, rejects the analysis advanced by the losing Clinton camp. At the Harvard post-election symposium, top Clinton aides accused Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway of blatantly courting America's white rac

But you may be wondering, are those frozen veggies as good as the fresh ones? New research says yes, if not better.

According to a study to be published in the June 2017 issue of the Journal of Food Composition and Analysis, some frozen fruits and vegetables may retain nutrients better than their fresh, refrigerated counterparts.

Jean-Francois Monier/Getty Images A bear enjoys some frozen broccoli.

"When considering the refrigerated storage to which consumers may expose their fresh produce prior to consumption, the findings of this study do not support the common belief of consumers that fresh food has significantly greater nutritional value than its frozen counterpart," the study, which was conducted by researchers from the University of Georgia in partnership with the Frozen Food Foundation — which has an obvious interest in promoting frozen foods — concluded.

The two-year-long study looked at the storage of blueberries, strawberries, corn, broccoli, cauliflower, green beans, green peas and spinach, analyzing their nutrients on the day of purchase, five days after being stored in the refrigerator and in frozen form.

"Our research shows that frozen fruits and vegetables are nutritionally equal to — and, in some cases, better than — their fresh-stored counterparts," UGA professor Dr. Ronald Pegg said in a news release. "In particular, Vitamin A was greater in frozen fruits and vegetables than select fresh-stored fruits and vegetables."

How does freezing keep the nutrients in?

A technique called fresh freezing, which freezes the vegetables as soon as they're ready instead of letting them sit on a truck or crate before being unpacked at a grocery store and then toted home, is what locks in those nutrients.

"Frozen vegetables are usually nutritionally equivalent to fresh vegetables because they're generally flash-frozen onsite, immediately after harvest," registered dietitian Emily Braaten, explained via email. "This kind of 'processing' may degrade some nutrients while making others more bioavailable."

Are we gaining enough nutrients to compensate for what we're losing in the freezing process?

"These changes are [insignificant] to the average consumer," Braaten said. "The important thing is to increase your intake of vegetables, regardless of the source."

So, should you switch from fresh to frozen?

"Most companies today want it to be fresh, natural, not overworked," Adar said.

McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks, Chipotle and Yum Brands didn't respond to CNBC email requests for comment about the practice of food styling. A Chick-fil-A spokeswoman said the company isn't sure it would "be a fit for this story" since it takes a different approach to using food in its commercials, which often center on cows advising people to 'eat mor chikin.'

A Wendy's spokesman said about food stylists, "We supply the same ingredients to them as our restaurants receive. We also require that they prepare and build the products to operational procedures. The big difference is how much time we take to get an appealing shot."

In a statement, Dunkin' Donuts Spokeswoman Michelle King said, "Dunkin' Donuts always uses real Dunkin' Donuts product in our advertisements. Our shoot director and food stylist team build the products to the exact specifications provided by Dunkin' Donuts' chefs to match what will be sold in our restaurants. We strive to ensure the authenticity of our products in our advertising."

On the regulatory side, Federal Trade Commission spokeswoman Betsy Lordan told CNBC by email that truth in advertising laws do apply to restaurant menu items displayed in ads. The commission examines both what's implied by and stated in an ad to determine whether it's deceptive.

"There are no specific FTC regulations governing food photos used in advertising, and the FTC has not pursued any cases alleging that food ads are deceptive based only on the photos," she wrote.

If, for example, customers see that McDonald's fries look different in person than in an ad, that would not cause the same regulatory concern as a false claim that a product has special properties, like reducing the risk of illness.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Austin Pets Alive! promotes the safety of humans and of our animals.

Neville was taken into Austin Pets Alive!’s rescue program a few months ago. Neville is a young, friendly dog who has never shown any signs of aggression. On September 22, Neville was playing with other dogs in a play yard when a family entered the yard to visit the dogs. The parents were advised by a staff member not to put their small son on the ground, because the dogs were playing energetically and a toddler could easily be accidentally knocked over. However, the child was placed on the ground and allowed to grab Neville, who unfortunately bit the child.

It is a very unfortunate situation for everyone, as we would never want a child to be harmed. However, we believe this was entirely preventable had our staff’s instructions and common sense been followed.

The family pleaded to the court system to have the dog killed, and Municipal Court Judge Clervi issued an order that Neville be killed, despite the evidence we presented.

“We don’t believe this is a dangerous dog,” said Mike Kaviani, APA!’s Dog Behavior Team manager. ”He did not seek out the child to bite, he was simply reacting to the child who cornered him. We haven’t been given any options at all other than killing the dog or we would be taking them. We are saddened and outraged we were not given an opportunity to find a better outcome for Neville.”

“Dogs can’t speak to us and tell us they don’t like something we are doing,” said Kaviani “They have limited ways to communicate and it’s our job to understand that.”<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>New York Times columnist Paul Krugman says that the Republican Party has adopted extreme anti-immigrant positions to appeal to their base, “which is, by and large, elderly white people arguing with empty chairs.”

During a Sunday panel segment on ABC News, Krugman pointed out that Clint Eastwood’s bizarre conversation with an empty chair at the Republican National Convention last month was illustrative of the party’s base.

“Arizona is a third Hispanic,” conservative columnist George Will noted. “The Republican Party spent 20 debates in the primary competing to see who could build the longest, thickest, tallest, most lethally-electrified fence. And Hispanics said, ‘I detect some hostility here.’ And it’s going to take a long time to undo that.”

Krugman agreed that the GOP’s move to the extreme right during the primary had hurt their standing with minority voters.

“The Republican Party is where it is because that’s where the base is,” Krugman agreed. “You watch that whole primary process, Republican candidates had to appeal to their base, which is, by and large, elderly white people arguing with empty chairs.”

Tea party favorite Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) also lamented that the Republican Party had completely given up on winning certain parts of the country.

“So what I keep telling them is, maybe we need some libertarian-type Republicans who might be popular in those areas,” he explained. “Maybe a less aggressive, more socially tolerant, but still fiscally conservative policy that that may be more libertarian might do better in California, might do better in Oregon, Washington, New England.”

“Our problem in the presidential election is we’ve given up 150 electoral votes before we get started.”

<|begin_of_text|>I am hooked on Slime Rancher! After playing stressful first person shooters that make my heart beat a million times a minute I needed a more relaxing (not boring!) game. I came across Slime Rancher, and tried the free demo before quickly purchasing the game. Not only is this a relaxing game, but it’s incredibly engaging and fun! After playing for a day here are six things I wish I knew before starting Slime Rancher.

1. That the “ocean” is not really water. It’s the rotting corpses of millions of cute slimes. Sorry to ruin that pristine ocean view for you.

2. The massive Slimes (i.e. Gordo) are not bosses to be killed, but super hungry Slimes that want to EAT. Feed those suckers, because when their belly gets too full they’ll die of happiness and trust me, it’s a win-win for everyone.

3. You can upgrade your corral with a plot collector. This upgrade will suck out all the plorts in your corral and store them in a container on the corner of the corral. I don’t know why this took me so long, but you must use your vac to suck the plorts out of the storage. I’m probably just an idiot, but I wish I had known how to do this before I spent five minutes trying every other button on my keyboard.

4. These scary nightmare slimes are called Tarr, and good news! They can be defeated. There’s special eery music that accompanies the Tarr and my first encounter with them was frightening. They stretch out arms and eat all the other slimes in the area! They’re incredibly hostile, and will attack on sight. They reminded me of the “nothing” from The Neverending Story novel. When I began Slime Rancher I would run away from the Tarr whenever I saw them, but now I know they can be combated.

Chuck them into the “ocean” (remember what it really is!)

Purchase an incinerator for a plot on your ranch and toast those suckers.

Spray them with water that you get from geysers or ponds.

Toss them into a pond.

5. Slimes can’t die from starvation, but they’ll be very upset and hungry! You don’t want your slimes to be upset do you?

This was not a knock like, “Hey, what’s up?” or even, “I really need to talk to you.” This was a knock that said, “I am going to get in there, and when I do, it’s gonna suck to be you.” The person outside the door was screaming for my roommate.

I asked who it was.

My roommate called the cops, but it took a while for them to get there. The knocking stopped—a ploy. We could still see the shadow of two feet under the door. He stood out there, stark still and silent. Then the knob started to slowly turn. He was trying to get in. A few minutes before the cops arrived, he left. Honestly, that night had been coming

a long time.

When I first met my roommate freshman year, I was cautiously optimistic. He seemed nice enough. I thought I could chill with him, even after he starting talking about drugs the first week of class. I had never done any. The first time he had ever smoked weed was during senior week, and he began to smoke more regularly over the summer. When I met him he smoked twice a week.

Eventually, he was smoking almost every night out the window of the men’s bathroom. He would come back giggling and stay up all night playing online poker. He also experimented with other substances, like Adderall—to help him stay awake for gambling and more weed.

He and his buddies would even strangle each other to the point of passing out to get high off the oxygen deprivation. I’m not exactly sure when he started dealing.

He would get visits from strange girls, beautiful girls who he would bang that night then never see again. Most of them brought little gifts: cigarettes, teddy bears, etc. I thought he just had serious game.

During the third month of school I talked to the resident assistant (RA) and, without naming specifics, told him that I was very uncomfortable with my roommate. My RA told me my only recourse was to file a formal complaint, but my roommate was popular on the floor. I didn’t want to be the one getting him thrown out. Not to mention the paperwork; finals were coming up.

Then, one night, early in the spring semester, he and his buddies were in

<|begin_of_text|>The Republican lawmaker’s call to ICE will “almost assuredly” be used to show ‘discriminatory intent,’ an attorney said.

A Texas lawmaker’s decision to report protesters to immigration police Monday could come back to haunt the state when it defends the law in court, an attorney involved in the case said Thursday.

On Monday, Representative Matt Rinaldi, R-Irving, called Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after hundreds of mostly Latino activists filled the House gallery to protest Senate Bill 4, the controversial ‘sanctuary cities’ ban.

Jose Garza, an attorney representing El Paso County in its suit against SB 4, told the Observer that the incident will “almost assuredly” be used to help establish in court that the Texas Legislature passed the law with “discriminatory intent.”

“This was a peaceful protest and many were citizens,” Garza said, “and Rinaldi sicced ICE on them because they were brown.”

Rinaldi, a member of the far-right House Freedom Caucus and an outspoken supporter of SB 4, said in a statement on Monday that he called ICE after seeing signs that read “I am illegal.” After several people, including Democratic lawmakers, said there was no evidence of those signs, Rinaldi clarified in a radio interview Thursday that the signs read “undocumented and unafraid” and “undocumented and here to stay.”

El Paso County and the City of El Cenizo have both sued the state over SB 4, and Austin and San Antonio have announced plans to take legal action as well. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton pre-emptively filed his own lawsuit, which he hopes will lead to a judge declaring the law constitutional, shortly after Governor Greg Abbott signed SB 4 into law.

SB 4 is set to go into effect September 1. Opponents hope a federal injunction will halt the measure before that date. Proving “discriminatory intent” in the lawmaking process is part of their legal strategy.

Thanks to an amendment by Rinaldi’s fellow House Freedom Caucus member Matt Schaefer, SB 4 will allow police to ask people who’ve been detained — not just arrested — about their immigration status. The law also threatens to jail law enforcement officials who limit cooperation with federal immigration agents.

Rinaldi’s call to ICE Monday nearly prompted a fistfight on the House floor. Representative Ramon Romero Jr. said Rinaldi’s call to ICE demonstrates how the law licenses discrimination.

<|begin_of_text|>ZEPHYRHILLS — An 84-year-old Zephyrhills woman who rarely left her tiny duplex stepped forward Wednesday as the winner of the largest single jackpot in American lottery history, valued at $590.5 million.

Shortly after claiming her prize, Gloria C. MacKenzie stepped back into the shadows.

Lottery officials announced midmorning that the Powerball winner had arrived with the lone winning ticket, which was sold last month at a Zephyrhills Publix.

"They walked right through the headquarters of the Florida Lottery here in Tallahassee and said, 'I have a winning ticket and I'd like to validate it,' " Lottery Secretary Cynthia O'Connell said at a news conference.

MacKenzie, her face hidden behind large black sunglasses, arrived with her son Scott, a family friend and her financial and legal advisers. She said nothing to the pack of reporters who swarmed her.

Neighbors in Zephyrhills said that guarded profile fits with what they know of MacKenzie.

"She liked to talk, but not with everybody," said Jorge Trapero, who lives in the apartment attached to MacKenzie's, across from a cow pasture.

He said she was strong: "Sometimes she'd come from the store to buy something and I'd see her over there taking the bags. 'Gloria you want some help?' She'd say, 'No, no, no, it's okay. I can do it.' "

Neighbor Bruce Featherston described the area as working class — "where people are really struggling."

"I assumed she was just an elderly lady scraping to get by," he said of MacKenzie. "She never had anything fancy."

Now she's walking away with a lump sum payment of more than $370 million, before taxes.

• • •

In a statement, MacKenzie called the winnings a blessing, and recalled how a person in line at Publix allowed her to go ahead to buy her single Quick Pick ticket.

Mindy Crandell, 34, was in line at Publix with her two daughters that day, she said, when a woman stepped in front of her.

"I don't know that she was intentionally cutting," Crandell, who lives in Dade City, said in an interview Wednesday, "or maybe she didn't realize she did it."

Crandell let it go. She was worried about keeping her 5-year-old, Jeffa, entertained.

Later, when she heard about the winner she couldn't help but think it might

<|begin_of_text|>The ultra-compact TelePen is a handy collapsible pen that attaches to your keychain. Weighing less than an ounce and measuring less than two inches, you'll hardly notice the diminutive telescoping pen dangling from your keyring. But the TelePen is there when you need it, expanding to nearly the length of a standard pen. Its tough stainless steel exterior protects it from the elements. Includes three black ink refills.

Attach it to your keyring and you'll always have a pen

Searching for a pen in a hurry is frustrating. The TelePen mini telescoping pen attaches to your keychain so you'll never again be without a pen.

You may be thinking, "But I have a fancy mobile phone. It has an app for making me sound like T-Pain, so surely I don't need old technology like a pen!" As awesome as "I am T-Pain" is, you are wrong about not needing a pen. There is no faster way to jot down a note than with a trusty pen.

Imagine the following scenario: You're talking on said mobile device and your wife is giving you a list of groceries to pick up. Are you going to grab yet another cell phone and fire up its note-taking function in order to write down the list? Surely not because you have the TelePen Telescoping Pen on your keychain!

Simply push or pull to collapse or expand

Push or pull the TelePen to shrink or expand the telescoping tubes. When fully extended, give it a sharp tug to remove the pen from the keyring holder.

The tough TelePen can handle abuse

Your keychain lives a rough life. Tossed around your house, buried in purses, pockets, and jackets; there's a reason why keys are made from metal. Thankfully, the TelePen can handle its fair share of abuse due to its stainless steel construction.

Expands from the size of a key to a nearly full-size pen

When collapsed, the TelePen is a hair under two inches long making it about the size of a standard house key. When expanded, it's nearly the length of a full-size pen.

With the TelePen, you're not going to feel like you're using one of those miniature golf course pencils.

Includes three black ink refills

In addition to the keyring (which is included), each TelePen includes three black ink refills.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

The first experience of life was a bright point of light followed by the sound of distant, muted whispers. A flood of sensory information registered self-awareness, when just before there was only a sea of blackness. A new mind took inventory of the world surrounding him: his chest, rising and falling with the sensation of air rushing into his lungs; the taste of saliva and the contraction of throat muscles as he swallowed; hands that opened and closed into fists as he commanded; all virgin experiences, so it seemed, for a man who was just born inside a coffin.

Lying supine, he blinked several times, struggling to make sense of his narrow confines. A glass shield was just inches from his face, where he gazed with frustrating uncertainty upon a reflection that was his own. An older man, with creases stretched across a high forehead and steel-grey eyes set upon severe cheekbones, returned the bewildered stare.

Who am I? this lost soul asked, struggling to reach backwards in time for a memory or reference, anything to place this surreal state of being into context. But there was nothing there, and the sea of blackness prevailed.

As he tried to lift his shoulders, a medical device descended from inside the chamber and passed a bluish light over the entire length of his body. It was then that he realized the base of his skull was fastened to the bed’s surface, and that the connection was through a metallic socket implanted directly into the bone.

I am a capsuleer, he realized, peering through the glass at a ceiling high above. One of the immortals, but... what happened to me? The device hovered over his squinting eyes before an artificial voice spoke softly:

‘Good morning. Your vital signs are excellent. Try to relax while I assess the rebuilding progress of your temporal lobe. Scanning...’

With the centre light focusing on his eyes, additional beams were projected onto his face. Then he felt a tingling sensation in the back of his head.

‘I’m going to ask you several questions,‘ the voice continued. He found her voice soothing, despite its artificial tone. ‘Do you know what today’s date is?’

‘No,‘ he answered. ‘Where am I?’

The voice remained impassive, but gentle. ‘Do you know what your name is?’

He was about to answer ‘No’ in desperation again when a bright flash illuminated the room beyond the glass, followed by a loud muffled thud that shook

Reporting in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers write of reducing anxiety and stress in mice by feeding them a probiotic-laced broth. Study author John Cryan discusses how the gut influences the brain, and whether the same might hold true in humans.

IRA FLATOW, host: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. You might have heard probiotic bacteria help keep your gut healthy, but could they be good for your brain, too? A study out this week suggests the answer is yes, at least for mice, because mice on a probiotic diet for a couple of weeks were more relaxed than their counterparts who were not.

They showed fewer visible signs of anxiety, lower levels of stress hormones, even chemical changes in the brain. Sounds a little like valium, doesn't it? Other than signals telling you when you're hungry or full, what connection is there between the intestinal tract and the brain? And why would it be there?

I know you yogurt lovers out there are probably wondering: Is there any chance this finding might hold true for humans? Well, we'll talk about it. If you'd like to, our number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. You can tweet us @scifri, S-C-I-F-R-I, go to our website and talk over there, or you can go to our Facebook page, /scifri.

My next guest is an author of that probiotic study, published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Scientists. John Cryan is a professor at University College Cork in Ireland, and he joins us by phone. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Cryan.

JOHN CRYAN: Thank you very much, Ira, it's good to be on.

FLATOW: This sounds amazing. You fed the lab animals probiotics, and then why would they have any effect on the brain?

CRYAN: Well, I mean, it's been long known that the brain and the gut communicate, as you mentioned, in terms of feelings of hunger, et cetera. And so what's becoming clearer over the last while is that this brain-gut communication or gut-brain, it's a bidirectional communication, but also that the microbials, which is the gut's flora within the gut, can actually also play an important part in regulating this axis

As my thread ( https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759239020 ) got locked, I am reposting the text here again. It is not really direct feedback to the resurrect, but rather a feature suggestion:I think it is important for a Mercy player to let your teammates know, that you can revive someone. If you can't or don't want to communicate in voice chat, there is no way telling your team besides typing it in the text chat (which obviously isn't pratical mid game).I would suggest to add this feature: If Mercy's resurrect is off cooldown / available for use, pressing the bound key (by default that's E) will let the player ping to their team that Mercy can resurrect (if there is no resurrection target in range of course). Also with the current Valkyrie, this pinging could also report the amount of resurrects (1 or 2) available, just like Symmetra with her teleporter charges. An other idea could be adding the amount of seconds left until the next resurrect is available to this ping message.Also, with this feature the existing voice lines of Mercy's former ultimate, could be used again ("I am ready to resurrect you", "I am ready to revive you") :)I would really appreciate this being a feature and I am keen to know what the community thinks about this.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

My name is Noor Kajol, and I am 10 years old. I was very happy in my old village because I was studying at the madrassa - I liked learning about the holy Quran, and I wanted to memorise all of it. I lived with my family; there were seven of us in total. The house was not very big, but I liked living there.

We had to flee our homes because the military started shooting us. I was inside the house with my father when they shot him through the window.

The bullet hit him in the head, he fell on the floor, and a lot of blood was coming out of his head.

I was really scared, and I was crying a lot. We ran away, leaving my father in the house. The military burned the house down, even though my father was still inside.

We had to run away to the forest and hide in the trees. We then walked for three days to get to Bangladesh. It was difficult for me because I was hungry and I missed my father a lot.

Other people helped us cross the border for free, which was very nice of them. We travelled in a boat with an engine, but I did not enjoy the boat ride because I still missed my father. He was a woodcutter, and everyone liked him. He was a good-natured man, and he loved me a lot.

I am very unhappy in Bangladesh because I miss my father so much. It is also very dirty here; there are no toilets or bathrooms.

I would like the world to help us get our own country back or offer us another country that we could live in.

The plight of Myanmar's Rohingya

Nearly 400,000 Rohingya, mainly women and children, have fled to Bangladesh in the recent weeks as a result of indiscriminate violence against civilian populations carried out by the Myanmar army.

The UN and other human rights organisations have warned that the mass exodus following killings, rapes, and burned villages are signs of "ethnic cleansing", pleading for the international community to pressure Aung San Suu Kyi and her government to end the violence.

"The situation seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing," UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said on

The doctor whose hands were tied

Dr D.K. Satpathy, aged 66, sits below a painting of what looks like his younger self surrounded by flying doves. He is relaxed, animated, but becomes increasingly emotional as he recalls that fateful night, 30 years ago, when Bhopal became the site of one of the world’s worst industrial disasters.

From 2 to 3 December 1984, about 24 metric tonnes of methyl isocyanate (MIC), a highly volatile and deadly gas, escaped from the US-controlled Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal. Thousands of people were living in shanty towns nearby.

Like many of those people, Dr Satpathy was asleep when it happened. “Suddenly, at 4am, my professor comes to my home,” he recalls. “He is shouting at me to rush to the mortuary as fast as possible.”

Dr Satpathy, a pathologist and former head of the state Medico-Legal Institute, immediately ran to Hamidia Hospital. As he approached, he found the road was full of people.

“I saw thousands of people lying there. Some were wailing, some were gasping, some were crying. I couldn’t understand what was happening.”

As patients died around him, Dr Satpathy and his colleagues struggled to find a way to treat them. One doctor rang up a medical official at Union Carbide hoping to find out more. The official’s response, recalls Dr Satpathy, was that the accident had “something to do with… carbon monoxide” and that it was “not a serious matter”. His advice was to “put a wet cloth in their mouth and they will get well.”

Shocked by this, Dr Satpathy, too, appealed to the Union Carbide official: “I told him, ‘Sir, I am Dr Satpathy. I am your student speaking. You are a citizen of Bhopal. Union Carbide is from a foreign country and here my people are dying. If you know anything, please tell me, so that at least we shall be able to extend some medical treatment.’ He replied saying, ‘I am a citizen of Bhopal. The people who are dying are my brothers. If I knew anything, I would have definitely told you.

From the voice and the facial expressions to the tan and the poorly tailored suit, Alec Baldwin rocketed to the top of the Donald Trump impersonators list on "Saturday Night Live" this weekend. The comedian flat-out nailed Trump's many idiosyncrasies.

But Baldwin's impression of the Republican presidential nominee remained safely in the realm of absurdist humor, never venturing into the territory of truly biting satire. An article by The Washington Post's David Weigel asked Friday, "Can SNL take down Donald Trump? Is it going to try?" The answer, at least for now, appears to be no.

As expected, the opening sketch Saturday parodied last week's presidential debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton.

"Good evening, America," Baldwin-as-Trump said in his opening statement. "I am going to be so good tonight. I am going to be so calm and so presidential."

With a boast and a locker-room joke, Baldwin immediately captured Trump's style.

Later, Baldwin hit on three other Trump habits — repeating phrases, making excuses and peddling conspiracy theories: "My microphone is broken. She broke it. With Obama. She and Obama stole my microphone. They took it to Kenya. They took my microphone to Kenya, and they broke it, and now it's broken."

Other jokes centered on Trump's hair, his pronunciation of "China" and his debate-night sniffles. It was funny stuff, but it is unlikely to satisfy critics such as comedian Samantha Bee, who a couple weeks ago shredded NBC for normalizing Trump through shows like "Saturday Night Live."

"To its credit," Bee said on her weekly TBS show, "NBC did sever ties with Trump after he called Mexicans rapists — if by severing ties you mean inviting him on their flagship comedy programs to show millions of Americans what a fun guy he is."

Last June, NBC said it was ending its business relationship with Trump, who had been the longtime host of "The Apprentice" and the network’s partner on telecasts of the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants. Five months later, however, the network invited Trump to host "Saturday Night Live," and the real estate mogul has appeared with Jimmy Fallon on "The Tonight Show" three times since September 2015.

<|begin_of_text|>Although I have been a so-called ‘black’ American and a social conservative all my life – and found the two aspects of my identity to be remarkably congruent – I am always surprised when confronted with some of the vitriol that I and my fellow black conservatives face when addressing the black community. I have often wondered why it is ok for other groups to maintain a diversity of political viewpoints – whether they are Asians, Latinos, or Jewish Americans – but black Americans seem to believe that anyone who does not vote the party line is a traitor to his or her race.

Why is it that among African Americans anyone who does not support the Democrats or liberal causes is labeled a sell-out, or a ‘self-loathing’ black person? Are we not as diverse in our thinking as other groups? We should really avoid chastising each-other for thinking differently. Instead we should appreciate and celebrate our wonderfully diverse community. We should welcome diverse perspectives as an asset, not a liability. The more we do this, the faster we will grow as a community and attain mainstream success in America.

Case in point; many were quick to chastise the pastors who opened the door for Donald Trump’s message to the black community; but where are those same people when it comes time to chastising the murderers in Chicago that are killing people? When it comes to Donald Trump though, it seems there is a special kind of disrespect. People hate Trump so much – and by default some of his black surrogates – that the discussion gets overheated before we even get a chance to discuss the issues. Now, I’m not going to pretend that Trump hasn’t been a magnate for controversy, whether intentionally or not, but surely we don’t all have to lose our heads just because something outrageous that might have been said by a candidate on the campaign trail.

Since when has merely having a conversation become a prohibited act? The attitude in some parts of the black community seems to be, ‘I can’t even talk to you because I can’t understand how you can support Trump.’ But for business-people and others within the black community, we look at a guy like Donald Trump and we see an opportunity. Perhaps Trump’s not a perfect guy – who is? – but surely we can have a conversation about the things we have in common.

For example, what about Obamacare? I own businesses with over a hundred employees. Obamacare has increased the overhead costs for health coverage significantly in my company. It has reduced the number of people (including African Americans) that I can

The first anniversary of Occupy Wall Street was a joyous affair for the 99%.

Yet regrettably, it was also a day that illustrated how Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s ‘private army’ has been increasingly unleashed to beat, arrest, imprison, and broadly suppress OWS.

Please post your videos, photos, and stories about how your rights were infringed on the Occupy Bloomberg’s Army Facebook page.

Occupy is a nonviolent movement, but this has not prevented Bloomberg’s Army from engaging in targeted arrests of specific organizers as well as random street ‘snatch and release’ intimidation tactics.

On September 17th not even the constant drone of helicopters overhead could drown out the screams of ‘I’m a journalist’ from the reporters who were arrested merely for practicing their and our right to freedom of the press.

And not even a cry of ‘I’m a City Councilmember’ was enough to staunch the established policy of brutality within the Mayor of Wall Street’s Police Department.

The message being sent by Bloomberg’s Army is being heard loud and clear. In Bloomberg’s New York: anyone who supports Occupy Wall Street in any fashion is being made an example of.

Were you one of these people extra-legally arrested or assaulted, or have you witnessed someone who was?

Post your videos, photos, and stories on the Occupy Bloomberg’s Army Facebook page.

We will not be stymied by the over 180 arrests on our anniversary, nor intimidated by the unprovoked and random nature of so many of them.

We will fight for our right to protest Wall Street while we protest Wall Street itself.

By Neve Gordon & Yigal Bronner

27 January, 2009

Guardian.co.uk

Israeli soccer matches were suspended during the assault on Gaza. When the games resumed last week, the fans had come up with a new chant: "Why have the schools in Gaza been shut down?" sang the crowd. "Because all the children were gunned down!" came the answer.

Aside from its sheer barbarism, this chant reflects the widespread belief among Israeli Jews that Israel scored an impressive victory in Gaza – a victory measured, not least, by the death toll.

Israeli pilots and tank commanders could not really discriminate between the adults and the children who hid in their homes or huddled in the UNRWA shelters, and yet they chose to press the trigger. Therefore, it is not at all surprising that the lethal onslaught left 1,314 Palestinians dead, of which 412 – or nearly one third of all of the casualties – were children.

This latest assault underscores that Israel, not unlike Hamas, readily resorts to violence and does not distinguish between civilians and combatants (only the weapons at Israel's disposal are much more lethal). No matter how many times the Israeli government tries to blame Hamas for the latest Palestinian civilian deaths it simply cannot explain away the body count, especially that of the children. In addition to the dead, 1,855 Palestinian children were wounded, and tens of thousands of others have likely been traumatised, many of them for life.

Every child has a story. A Bedouin friend recently called to tell us about his relatives in Gaza. One cousin allowed her five-year-old daughter to walk to the adjacent house to see whether the neighbours had something left to eat. The girl had been crying from hunger. The moment she began crossing the street a missile exploded nearby and the flying shrapnel killed her. The mother has since been bedridden, weeping and screaming, "I have let my girl die hungry".

As if the bloody incursion was not enough, the Israeli security forces seem to be keen on spreading the flames of hatred among the Arab population within Israel. Hundreds of Palestinian citizens of Israel have been arrested for protesting at the Israeli assault and more than 200 of them are still in custody. One incident is enough to illustrate the psychological effect these arrests will likely have on hundreds more children.

A few days after the ceasefire, several men wearing black ski masks stormed the home of Muhammad Abu Humus. They came to arrest him for protesting against the

"Cynthia Stewart, a 17-year-old junior at Tharptown High School in

northern Alabama, is a member of her school’s prom planning committee,

had personally raised over $200 for the prom, and created the theme her

classmates had chosen for the dance. She is also an out lesbian. When Cynthia approached her principal to ask if she could bring her

girlfriend with her to the prom, he said no. He also made Cynthia

remove a sticker she was wearing that said, 'I am a lesbian,' telling

her, “'You don't have that much freedom of speech at school.' Cynthia’s

aunt and guardian, Kathy Baker, then appealed the principal’s decision

to the school board. But the board let the decision to bar Cynthia

The school has apparently threatened to cancel the prom for everyone should Stewart bring her girlfriend.

<|begin_of_text|>You know Erykah Badu has always been one to push the envelope. And things really haven’t changed. Recently, a video of the singer serenading a group of nuns is being shared all around social media.

And Badu wasn’t exactly singing “Ava Maria.” Instead, she sang the first couple of lines from Kendrick’s hit song, “B*tch, Don’t Kill My Vibe.”

She didn’t cuss or anything instead, she sang the chords, “I am a sinner who’s probably going to sin again. Loord…” and then the video cuts off but not before Badu records the nun’s reactions.

Many people, including myself, found the video hilarious. The way I see it, if she stopped with those lyrics then she should be good, most Christians agree that we’re all sinners. But others think she took things a little too far.

What do you think was this funny or is this a little blasphemous?<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Happy New Year everyone! I have been on a short hiatus (and I’ll be honest, a bit of a food splurge) over the holiday period. It was nice to take a couple of weeks off to enjoy with both family and friends and to take a bit of a break away from work and the daily stresses of life.

So today marks the first day back to clean eating and getting back into shape. I have definitely packed on a few pounds over the holiday period so it’s time to start afresh and get my diet back in order. But of course it feels like a bit of an effort preparing meals when you have been lying on a beach for a week and snacking on chips whenever you feel hungry. But no matter how easy fast food is, it’s never the same as a fresh home cooked meal and definitely never as satisfying.

So without further ado, here’s a clean eating recipe for lime chicken that is really, really, really easy to make and takes very little time to make.

Ingredients:

For Lime Chicken-

4 tablespoons lime juice

3 tablespoons olive oil

1kg chicken breast (approx 2.2 pounds)

4 tablespoon of finely chopped coriander

1 pinch salt

For Salsa-

1 large tomato, diced

1 small white onion, diced

1 large cucumber, chopped

1 pinch salt

3 tablespoons lime juice

pepper, to taste

Method:

To marinate the chicken, combine the lime juice, olive oil and coriander in a bowl. Add the chicken and let it sit for about 5 minutes. Drain the liquid and season with salt. Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat. When the pan is hot, add the chicken and cook until browned through. Drain any remaining liquid. In a separate bowl combine the tomato, cucumber, onion, lime juice, salt and pepper. Plate the chicken and top with salsa (I added some brown rice to my meal as well).

There you have it, quick and easy and nice and clean! Serve 4 and can easily be packed away for a desk lunch.

Happy New Year!

<|begin_of_text|>Because no Internet meme is validated unless it comes out in printed form, Keanu Reeves has used the uber popular "Sad Keanu" meme as inspiration for a book.

"Sad Keanu" hit last summer courtesy of a glorious paparazzi photo and the folks over at Reddit. Strangely enough, it took Reeves until October to find out about his own memetastic existence.

Still, he's apparently taking it all in good stride — in spite of the fact that he's had a rather hard life, jam-packed with things to be sad about (aside from Bill & Ted 3).

The New York Daily News reports that Reeves is out with a very limited edition book called Ode to Happiness — 4,000 copies are being sold in the UK. The book, which really started off as a joke, basically features a lot of ink blots with sad sayings under them. Sample: "I draw a hot sorrow bath."

"[I was listening to a radio station that] was playing, like, an orgy of depressing, self-pitying, nostalgic music," Reeves told the Daily News. "You know, 'I'm so lonely and I've been left and my heart is broken.' It was so voluptuously horrible. And I just started to write on this piece of paper, because I had this image of, you know, that moment when you take that bath, you light that candle, and you're really just kind of depressed. And it was making [my friend] laugh so hard."

Reeves also apparently hopes to pen another book called Haikus of Hope. "Basically like, 'I want to kill myself', and go from there," he told the publication.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Curling up with your favorite ball of fur as she purrs away is pretty close to heaven, at least for cat folk. Yet, hidden between those vibrations, that most appealing of domestic sounds remains wrapped in mystery, and even a little magic.

No one is certain exactly why cats purr, though there are a number of good guesses. The obvious observation is cats seem to purr when they're pleased and feeling good. But that's not always the case: Some cats also purr when they're hungry, injured, or frightened. And most surprisingly, purring frequencies have been shown to stimulate bone regeneration—yes, bone regeneration.

Cats purr by using their larynx and diaphragm muscles, both as they inhale and as they exhale, although just how the central nervous system generates and controls those contractions isn't yet understood. Early 19th century taxonomists thought cats could either purr or roar, and split the family Felidae along these lines—"purrers' (subfamily Felinae) and 'roarers' (subfamily Pantherinae).

Today, though, taxonomists believe most cats can purr, with a few probable (though not certain) pantherine exceptions: lion, leopard, jaguar, tiger, snow leopard and clouded leopard. (Cheetahs and cougars? Yeah, they purr.)

So, why do it? If it's a form of communication, it's meant for those near and dear, since cats purr at a frequency and volume too low to travel far. Purring (and many other low-frequency vocalizations in mammals) often are associated with positive social situations: nursing, grooming, relaxing, being friendly.

More likely, though, purring is simply soothing, or self-soothing, as cats may also purr in stressful situations. In that case, purring would be akin to how humans soothe themselves by crying, laughing, distracting themselves, or even organizing their desk. Some veterinarians and cat enthusiasts have observed cats lying alongside each other and purring when one is injured (a behavior termed "purr therapy"), though scientific literature on the subject is scant.

Beyond being calming for the injured kitty, "purr therapy" may have bone healing properties. Domestic cats purr at a frequency of about 26 Hertz, in a range that promotes tissue regeneration. That's not as crazy as it sounds: High-impact exercise promotes bone health for

Over time, in our little restaurant in Atlanta, Georgia we have heard several people say they like the Jamaican food but it’s “too spicy.” That’s before they try anything on our menu…go figure.

And to their surprise, after tasting a sample of our food, such as Stew Chicken or Oxtail, their expression was,"this is soooo good, can I have the recipe?" "mmm...Sure!"

See, no need to hold the spice. Why? It isn’t hot and spicy at all.

Asking parents just two simple screening questions could help health care providers and social workers to easily and quickly identify families whose young children are suffering from hunger, enabling early interventions that could prevent serious health consequences, according to a new study led by University of Maryland School of Medicine researchers. The study, published July 1 in the journal Pediatrics, analyzed data gathered from more than 30,000 families nationwide, about a quarter of whom suffered from hunger. The researchers examined whether the time-consuming, 18-question Household Food Security Survey provided by the federal government could be shortened and still be effective in identifying hungry families. They found that just the first two statements, with which families were asked to agree or disagree, were key: "Within the past 12 months we worried whether our food would run out before we got money to buy more;" and "Within the past 12 months the food we bought just didn't last and we didn't have money to get more."

The researchers found that 92.5 percent of the hungry families answered "yes" to the first question, and 81.9 percent of the families answered yes to the second, meaning that positive answers to those questions alone could accurately identify most families affected by hunger.

Such an efficient screening test can save time and get help to more hungry families faster, according to lead author Erin Hager, Ph.D., assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. "This paper is the evidence that it works," Dr. Hager says. "Now, this can immediately be used by any social service agency or any clinic to more quickly get hungry children connected with the assistance they need to stay nourished, healthy and developmentally on track."

Hunger can be invisible in American children because they do not physically appear skinny or emaciated, according to senior author Maureen Black, Ph.D., the John A. Scholl, M.D., and Mary Louise Scholl, M.D., Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. "Unlike hungry children in Third World countries who may go without food, American parents have access to cheap, nutrient-deprived foods they can use to fill their children's bellies and maintain their weight. However, without critical nutrients such as iron, babies and toddlers can suffer from serious health consequences."

Health care professionals rarely ask parents if they have enough nutritious food to feed their families. "People who are hungry and who can't feed their kids are often

It’s about sodium-loaded pork fat, stinky triple-cream cheeses, the tender thymus glands and distended livers of young animals. It’s about danger—risking the dark, bacterial forces of beef, chicken, cheese, and shellfish. Your first two hundred and seven Wellfleet oysters may transport you to a state of rapture, but your two hundred and eighth may send you to bed with the sweats, chills, and vomits. Gastronomy is the science of pain. Professional cooks belong to a secret society whose ancient rituals derive from the principles of stoicism in the face of humiliation, injury, fatigue, and the threat of illness. The members of a tight, well-greased kitchen staff are a lot like a submarine crew. Confined for most of their waking hours in hot, airless spaces, and ruled by despotic leaders, they often acquire the characteristics of the poor saps who were press-ganged into the royal navies of Napoleonic times—superstition, a contempt for outsiders, and a loyalty to no flag but their own. A good deal has changed since Orwell’s memoir of the months he spent as a dishwasher in “Down and Out in Paris and London.” Gas ranges and exhaust fans have gone a long way toward increasing the life span of the working culinarian. Nowadays, most aspiring cooks come into the business because they want to: they have chosen this life, studied for it. Today’s top chefs are like star athletes. They bounce from kitchen to kitchen—free agents in search of more money, more acclaim. I’ve been a chef in New York for more than ten years, and, for the decade before that, a dishwasher, a prep drone, a line cook, and a sous-chef. I came into the business when cooks still smoked on the line and wore headbands. A few years ago, I wasn’t surprised to hear rumors of a study of the nation’s prison population which reportedly found that the leading civilian occupation among inmates before they were put behind bars was “cook.” As most of us in the restaurant business know, there is a powerful strain of criminality in the industry, ranging from the dope-dealing busboy with beeper and cell phone to the restaurant owner who has two sets of accounting books.

Jamie knows that Alex has a PhD in Subjectology, yet, during a discussion of Subject, Jamie, who has an interest in and is reasonably knowledgeable about Subject, condescendingly explains basics of Subject to Alex without regard for Alex's demonstrable proficiency. Alex expresses that Jamie's insistence on explaining basics makes Alex feel as though Jamie does not respect Alex's competency or intellectual capacity. Jamie, whose intent was actually to impress Alex, insists that hir intent was not to make Alex feel that way. Alex makes a valiant attempt to explain why Jamie behaving as though Alex doesn't know the basics of Alex's professional field is disrespectful, at which point Jamie gets miffed, reiterates that the intent was not to make Alex feel bad, accuses Alex of looking for things to get mad about, and misrepresents Alex's good faith attempt to address demeaning language as a personal attack on Jamie.

Thus, what had started out as an inadvertent slight becomes a harmful exchange, as Jamie refuses to acknowledge that the effect of the action irrespective of its intent was hurtful to Alex, and deflects accountability by casting Alex as unreasonable.

Example Two: Kelly and Terry are friends. Kelly is fat; Terry is thin. Terry routinely expresses disgust with hir body by saying things like, "I am so fat" and "This cellulite is disgusting." Kelly tells Terry that such expressions are hurtful and make hir wonder what Terry must think of hir, since zie is much fatter than Terry. Terry, whose intent was actually to solicit support and validation from Kelly, insists that hir intent was not to make Kelly feel that way. Kelly makes a valiant attempt to point out that even if it was not intended to make hir feel bad about hir body, it does, because Terry is associating fatness with something bad. Terry reacts defensively, reiterating that the intent was not to make Kelly feel bad and accusing Kelly of being jealous and oversensitive.

Thus, what had started out as a misguided attempt to connect becomes a harmful exchange, as Terry refuses to acknowledge that, despite a lack of intention to be hurtful, zie was hurtful nonetheless, and deflects accountability by projecting hir void of sensitivity onto Kelly as an abundance of oversensitivity.

He studied their identical faces, looking for any sort of imperfection that could distinguish them from each other. A pointless task but he wasn’t prepared to look up at Marge yet. He wondered if she would have actually liked the small golden ring he had bought her, the one with little green Colombian emerald that cost him a small fortune. ‘It’s perfect,’ he remembered thinking when he chanced upon it a couple of months earlier whilst browsing idly in a second-hand shop. And now he was holding it in his hands, wrapped in the special Christmas paper that they had bought together a few days before to wrap the gifts of those friends they didn’t really liked who lived down the road. A joke he thought she’d appreciate. How irrelevant it seemed now.

‘Are you not going to say anything? He heard Marge saying and he suddenly became aware of the Christmas lights wrapped around the tree next to him. ‘Will you marry me?’ he remembered practising in front of the mirror that morning. He didn’t want to ruin a moment they’ve both been waiting for for over 5 years. He smiled as he remembered his ruddy reflection in the mirror. ‘I’ve called Michael already,’ Marge went on, ‘he’s picking me up in 5 minutes.’

She stood up quickly, dropping the Christmas crackers she’d had on her lap. ‘I’m really sorry about this, Peter,’ she hesitated, ‘I just can’t do it anymore.’ He heard her steps as she walked away. He picked up one of the crackers and in search of another pointless task, he pulled it. The paper-thin hat, a miniature bowling set and the joke all fell to the ground. He picked up the hat and the joke. He looked toward the door where Marge was crying and pulling her coat on. Looking down, he read the joke. ‘What question can you never answer yes to? Are you asleep?’ The front door slammed closed. He could feel a tear forming in the corner of his eye and he dropped the joke and the wrapped present on the floor. He didn’t want to look up so he put his cracker hat on and softly muttered goodbye.

<|begin_of_text|>In Julian Barnes’s novel Staring at the Sun, teenage Jean Serjeant is struck by the firmness of her parents’ moral views. Their opinions seem to her like ‘honking frogs’ compared with her own ‘twitching, vulnerable tadpoles’. How can people be so sure of what they think, Jean wonders: ‘How could you know your own mind without using your mind to discover your mind in the first place?’ It seems almost circular, putting Jean in mind of ‘a dog circling in pursuit of its own cropped tail’.[1]

Jean’s questions provoke further questions. How do we discover what we think? If we must use our minds to discover our minds, then can we make mistakes about them? Can you be wrong about what you think, just as you can be wrong about what somebody else thinks? I express liberal views on most political and social issues, but can I be sure I really believe the things I say? Perhaps I just say them to fit in and get my friends’ approval?

The suggestion that we might make mistakes about our own minds runs against common sense. We assume that our minds are, as it were, transparent to us -- that we can tell what’s in them directly and infallibly. Yet there are reasons to doubt that common sense is right about this. It is possible to have a thought without knowing that you have it. Infants and non-human animals have beliefs (for example, that Daddy is close by or that there is food on the table), without knowing that they have them. They have beliefs but do not have beliefs about their beliefs. Some further process is required (some ‘use of the mind’) to gain that self-knowledge, and the process might not always be reliable. Moreover, there is experimental evidence that we do in fact make mistakes about our own minds. It is well established that people’s choices can be influenced by factors of which they are not consciously aware. For example, if offered a choice of identical items, people tend to opt for the one furthest to the right. But if asked why they chose this item, they do not mention its position but offer some plausible reason, such as that they thought it was the best quality. Similar effects have been observed in other experimental situations. It seems that when people do not know why they performed an action, they unconsciously confabulate an explanation for it, attributing to themselves mental states they do not really have.[2]

So how then do we get to know about our own

back to Music Humor Page

Author unkown. (Wish we knew, 'cause it's really funny)

1. Most Blues begin, "Woke up this morning..."

2. "I got a good woman" is a bad way to begin the Blues, unless you stick something nasty in the next line like, "I got a good woman, with the meanest face in town."

3. The Blues is simple. After you get the first line right, repeat it. Then find something that rhymes... sort of: "Got a good woman with the meanest face in town. Yes, I got a good woman with the meanest face in town. Got teeth like Margaret Thatcher, and she weigh 500 pound."

4. The Blues is not about choice. You stuck in a ditch, you stuck in a ditch--ain't no way out.

5. Blues cars: Chevys, Fords, Cadillacs and broken-down trucks. Blues don't travel in Volvos, BMWs, or Sport Utility Vehicles. Most Blues transportation is a Greyhound bus or a southbound train. Jet aircraft and company motor pools ain't even in the running. Walkin' plays a major part in the blues lifestyle. So does fixin' to die.

6. Teenagers can't sing the Blues. They ain't fixin' to die yet. Adults sing the Blues. In Blues, "adulthood" means being old enough to get the electric chair if you shoot a man in Memphis.

7. Blues can take place in New York City but not in Hawaii or any place in Canada. Hard times in Minneapolis or Seattle is probably just clinical depression. Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City are still the best places to have the Blues. You cannot have the blues in any place that don't get rain.

8. A man with male pattern baldness ain't the blues. A woman with male pattern baldness is. Breaking your leg cause you were skiing is not the blues. Breaking your leg 'cause a alligator be chompin' on it is.

9. You can't have no Blues in a office or a shopping mall. The lighting is wrong. Go outside to the parking lot or sit by the dumpster.

10. Good places for the Blues:

a. Highway

b. Jailhouse

c. An empty bed

d. Bottom of a whiskey glass

Derek Llambias sums up Newcastle's last two decades with a devastating critique that gets to the heart of why manager Alan Pardew has been awarded a stunning new eight-year contract.

"You look at the last 25 years at Newcastle and it has only known drama, from the highs to the lows," said Llambias, the St James' Park outfit's managing director.

"They worked on those glory transfers and all the dramas behind them - glory and bust, with no success.

"What was the success? It was basically. 'I've signed a player!'

"That has to end.

"It has."

Rewind to the bombshell of Newcastle's relegation in May 2009, and Llambias is equally forthright:

"Three years ago, it felt like the world was falling apart. How do you think we felt? Awful.

"[Owner] Mike Ashley and I had to sit down and be very honest about how we could turn it around, the mistakes made.

"We needed stability. And now we're getting there, but we can't stand still.

"You can't keep changing your manager if he has a bad run - it doesn't make any sense at all. We just want to break that mould in football. Eight years... this is where we've got to be."

While the football world was digesting, with an element of shock, the bold move to hand Pardew the clout of almost a decade in charge to shape a trophy-winning team, Llambias was explaining why it was a natural step.

Newcastle want to end years of upheaval, the spread of insecurity at the slightest run of bad results, and terrace gossip that infects many a coach's reign when the going gets tough.

The deal is reward for a surprise fifth place last season, but also because owner Mike Ashley is "in it for the long term" and has found a manager in Pardew he can trust and work with, but still have a sparky, challenging relationship with.

Off the pitch, the club is close to self-sufficiency. Financially stable.

Newcastle want stability on the pitch, too.

Yes, stability - not a word often associated with the Magpies.

The 2020 vision - for that is the year Pardew and co are now contracted until - includes nurturing a first XI depicted

The man, now known as Thomas Hamond, was found on the rooftops of several stores, wielding a bow and arrow. With emergency services having been called and concerned for his welfare the nearby area was evacuated.

Hamond was found to be wielding a bow and arrow at the scene, repeatedly shouting “Ryuu ga waga teki wo kurau!”. When officers tried to talk to the trespasser, he would only respond with “I am ready to unleash the dragon!” before firing arrows into the air.

The location where the incident occured

Fortunately for the those involved it transpired that the bow and arrow Hamond was using was a children's toy. “I’ve never seen anything like it. Not only was he naked with aluminum foil wrapped around his legs, but he’s firing toy arrows at us. I can’t pull some of them off my vehicle they’ve stuck so tight.”

Officer Schwimpy, who was first responder, went on to detail how he and his fellow officers were unable to open a dialogue with Hamond. “He just kept shouting Ryuu ga waga...something. I haven’t a clue what it means. He wouldn’t listen and kept talking about a dragon and moving a payload."

Local residents who were seen to be cheering on Hamond as he fired from the rooftops, were keen to support him. “I was sat drinking my mocha-choca-latte and looked up, and there’s this guy firing arrows down at the cops. Everyone dived for cover until they saw the rubber ends.” said one passerby.

Police released this image of the offending bow and arrow.

Hamond was eventually apprehended after local police cornered him on one of the rooftops. While being detained it is reported that he continually shouted “The dragon stirs within me!” and requested that officers be careful of his legs. Although there’s no additional information as to what prompted Hamond to behave as he did, relatives had become concerned about the amount of time he had been spending on his computer.

“He never shuts up about a girl called Mei. We think he’s got himself a girlfriend. We’re pleased but he never brings her home and now all this mess.” stated Hamond’s Mom, Linda.

There are however people who take Ayn Rand even more seriously than comic-book fans take "Watchmen." I expect to receive learned and sarcastic lectures on the pathetic failings of my review.

And now I am faced with this movie, the most anticlimactic non-event since Geraldo Rivera broke into Al Capone’s vault. I suspect only someone very familiar with Rand’s 1957 novel could understand the film at all, and I doubt they will be happy with it. For the rest of us, it involves a series of business meetings in luxurious retro leather-and-brass board rooms and offices, and restaurants and bedrooms that look borrowed from a hotel no doubt known as the Robber Baron Arms.

During these meetings, everybody drinks. More wine is poured and sipped in this film than at a convention of oenophiliacs. There are conversations in English after which I sometimes found myself asking, "What did they just say?" The dialogue seems to have been ripped throbbing with passion from the pages of Investors’ Business Daily. Much of the excitement centers on the tensile strength of steel.

The story involves Dagny Taggart (Taylor Schilling), a young woman who controls a railroad company named Taggart Transcontinental (its motto: "Ocean to Ocean"). She is a fearless and visionary entrepreneur, who is determined to use a revolutionary new steel to repair her train tracks. Vast forces seem to conspire against her.

It’s a few years in the future. America has become a state in which mediocrity is the goal, and high-achieving individuals the enemy. Laws have been passed prohibiting companies from owning other companies. Dagny’s new steel, which is produced by her sometime lover, Hank Rearden (Grant Bowler), has been legislated against because it’s better than other steels. The Union of Railroad Engineers has decided it will not operate Dagny’s trains. Just to show you how bad things have become, a government minister announces "a tax will be applied to the state of Colorado, in order to equalize our national economy." So you see how governments and unions are the enemy of visionary entrepreneurs.

<|begin_of_text|>Unfortunately for lovers of fantasy epics, hairy feet and stories where dwarves are packed into barrels, Guillermo Del Toro has announced that he's not going to direct the movie version of The Hobbit after all.

This is tragic. Upon leaving the theater after seeing The Return of the King for the first time, I imagine everyone was thinking the same thing: "Man, that was a freakingly long ending." But after that they thought, "I can't wait to see The Hobbit." It seemed inevitable, and if Peter Jackson wasn't going to direct it, then Del Toro was arguably the best alternative.

And now Del Toro has left the project. While the movie isn't cancelled, it's wandering aimlessly without a captain, like an abandoned ship or a poorly organized volleyball team. Where will we find a director capable of bringing J.R.R. Tolkien's vision to life? Let's consider the possibilities. What would happen if one of these well-known directors were hired to helm The Hobbit?

Tim Burton ———-

Tim Burton's grasp of magic and high weirdness is initially encouraging to fans, but doubt sets in when Johnny Depp is brought on to play Gandalf and decides to base his portrayal on eccentric celebrity Ozzy Osbourne. When Helena Bonham Carter is tapped to play Gollum, hopes take a dive, and the final product is praised for its bold use of color and shapes, but criticized for introducing a 10-minute dream sequence in which Bilbo is chased by a giant ring in a clown suit.

Terry Gilliam ————-

The first stills to come out of the production are very promising, but Terry Gilliam's famed bad luck comes into play when, over the course of a single week, a fire destroys the Smaug set, a flash flood wipes out Lake Town, Thorin Oakenshield develops spasmodic dysphonia, and the special-effects budget is cut to about half that of Big Momma's House 3. The movie as released, while flawed and a commercial failure, nonetheless becomes a cult favorite among film students and fisheye lens salesmen.

George Lucas ————

George Lucas decides that this Lord of the Rings prequel is lacking a certain something, and changes the plot to be about Sauron's early life as an adorable toddler caught in the middle of a continent-spanning dispute over water rights. Also, Sauron's best friend is an orc with an exaggerated Mexican accent named Boopily Boodily Moop

<|begin_of_text|>Picture a suburban housewife of the 1950s. Her name is Mrs. John Drone (Mary), and she lives in Rolling Knolls Estates, a new development of what the salesman calls "California Cape Cod Ramblers" on the outskirts of Washington, D.C. Whatever knolls might have rolled gently over the land at one time have been flattened for muddy streets of two-bedroom houses, named after famous conflicts of World War II.

One rainy morning on Bataan Boulevard, Mary hangs her washing on a clothesline in the living room and knocks her shin on her son’s tricycle. Pain shoots up her leg and she bursts into tears. Then the front door blows open, and she starts shouting:

‘Watch out, can’t you see the wash is up? You’re getting the wash all dirty.’ Mary very nearly screamed. ‘I’m sorry dear,’ a familiar, monotonous voice said. ‘Oh, it’s you,’ Mary said. And it was. John Drone, master of all he surveyed, had returned to his castle and to the bosom of his admiring family. He closed the door.

Mary and John are the unfortunate (fictional) protagonists of The Crack in the Picture Window, published in 1957 by John Keats, a journalist at the now defunct Washington Daily News. A lacerating (and very funny) indictment of postwar suburbs as "fresh-air slums," Keats’s polemic sold millions of copies in paperback. It revolves around the tragicomic story of the Drones, a nice young couple gulled, first, into buying a box at Rolling Knolls Estates, and then into thinking a larger, more expensive box in a different suburb could cure what ailed them.

When, near the start of the book, Mary hurts her leg and yells at her husband, Keats blames her agitation on her inadequate living space. If the house had had a basement, he notes, she could have hung the washing there rather than in the living room. If it had had more storage space, the tricycle wouldn’t have stood in her way. If it had had a separate dining room, rather than a rudimentary "dining alcove" off the kitchen, she wouldn’t have struggled to converse with a friend over the shouts of their children, which had frayed her nerves earlier the same day.

The problem was not Mary. It was her house:

75a: George Carlin / Billy Preston, Janis Ian

George Carlin’s Monologue

…..George Carlin

George Carlin: Thank you! Talk about a live show! It’s nice to see you, welcome, and thanks for joining us – live. Um.. I’m kinda glad that we’re on at night, so that we’re not competing with all the football and baseball. So many, man.. And this is the time of year when there’s both, you know?

Football’s kinda nice, they changed it a little bit – they moved the hash marks in. Guys found it and smoked them, anyway! But you know, football wants to be the number-one sport, the national pasttime. And I think it already is, really, because football represents something we are – we are Europe, Jr. When you get right down to it, we’re Europe, Jr. We play a Eurpe game. What was the Europe game? [ high voice ] “Let’s take their land away from them! You’ll be the pink, on up; we’ll be blue, the red and the green!”

Ground acquisition. And that’s what football is, football’s a ground acquisition game. You knock the crap out of eleven guys and take their land away from them. Of course, we only do it ten yards at a time. That’s the way we did it with the Indians – we won it little by little. First down in Ohio – Midwest to go!

Let’s put it this way – there are things about the words surrounding football and baseball, which give it all away:

Football is technological; baseball is pastoral.

Football is played in a stadium; baseball is played in the park.

In football, you wear a helmet; in baseball, you wear a cap.

Football is played on an enclosed, rectangular grid, and everyone of them is the same size; baseball is played on an ever-widening angle that reaches to inifinity, and every park is different!

Football is rigidly timed; baseball has no time limit, we don’t know when it’s gonna end! We might even have extra innings!

In football, you get a penalty; in baseball, you make an error – whoops!

The object in football is to march downfield and penetrate enemy territory, and get into the end zone; in baseball, the object is to go home! “I’m going home!”

And, in football

By 5 p.m., people are scurrying home, down streets potholed by artillery, past piles of rubble and mountains of garbage that hasn’t been collected in months, to spend the evenings huddled in the cold without heat, light or, increasingly, food.

“We just lie under blankets because it is so cold. We have no work, no money and no life,” said Omar Abu Mohammed, 55, one of the few remaining residents of his badly bombed neighborhood, as he prepared to head indoors for the night.

“It is time to go now because soon there will be snipers,” he added, as a shell boomed softly in the distance.

Shells are exploding somewhere in Aleppo most of the time, but after five months of fighting, people have become inured to the ever-present threat. Rain and cloudy skies have deterred warplanes, providing some relief from the airstrikes that can wipe out whole apartment buildings, along with their inhabitants, in an instant.

But the onset of this second winter since Syrians rose up against their government 22 months ago is bringing new calamity to a people already ground down by violence and war. Hunger, cold and disease are emerging as equally profound challenges in the desperate daily struggle that life has become for millions, not only in Aleppo but across Syria, where the quest for greater freedoms sparked by the Arab Spring has gone badly, horribly wrong.

“You can hide from the shelling, but if your child is hungry and there is no bread, what can you do?” asked Abdullah Awuf, 29, a driver who struggles to feed his infant son amid sky-high prices for fuel and food.

Aleppo is not the only place in Syria where conditions are dire. Across the country, reports are emerging of people foraging for food in garbage, stripping buildings for firewood and queuing for hours for scarce bread as the government-run distribution network breaks down.

The United Nations appealed last week for $1.5 billion to help 4.5 million needy Syrians, a record amount for an emergency, said Panos Moumtzis, the regional relief coordinator for the U.N. refugee agency. This one is unfolding almost entirely out of sight because most places are too dangerous or inaccessible for aid workers or journalists to visit.

MILWAUKEE -- A Muslim woman was attacked as she walked home from prayer. Milwaukee police tell FOX6 News they are investigating the crime that occurred near South 13th and Layton. The incident happened Monday morning, April 10th around 6:00 a.m. -- and the victim was just released from the hospital Tuesday afternoon. The details of the crime have some in the Islamic community saying it was a hate crime.

"I said to myself, 'I am going to die today for sure.' So he gets up from the car and told me to come here," said the woman who was attacked.

The woman, who does not want her identity to be shared, said a car pulled up alongside her.

"And one man came from a car," she said.

That man wanted only one thing: to remove the woman's hijab, or head scarf.

"He said to take my hijab, my scarf. I tried to fight him. 'Don't take my hijab,' you know? So he threw me on the floor then he beat me like an animal," said the victim.

The attacker was able to pull the scarf off. Blood stains remained on it Tuesday:

The woman said her attacker threw her to the sidewalk, and then stepped down on her head repeatedly. She described him taking out a knife to cut her jacket and her arm.

"Certainly we're scared for our community members. As an Islamic community, we want to make sure our community is always safe. The initial reaction is shock," said Munjed Ahmad with the Islamic Society of Milwaukee.

Those at the Islamic Center will discuss having security patrols on nearby streets. At this point, they believe this to be a hate crime.

"Nothing was stolen. There was no robbery. Her valuables remain with her. The only motive we can think of -- because everything stayed with her and this individual went straight for her scarf is a hate crime," said Ahmad.

Those from the community are glad the attacker didn't take more -- the woman's life.

The victim somehow made it home. That's where she had a seizure and was taken to the hospital. She said during the beating, the attacker was calling her names and swearing at her.

Police say they are investigating and there is no suspect in custody at this time.

The campaign, launched by environment group A Plastic Planet, has the backing of doctors, scientists and a host of celebrities to highlight the potential dangers of chemicals from plastic leaking into food.

People more aware of plastics danger

The group's organiser Sian Sutherland, told Sky News: "The one thing we can't do now is push our trolleys to get our meat, our fruit and fish in a plastic-free aisle.

"There is increasing scientific evidence to say there could be seepage from plastic into our food.

"We want to work with supermarkets to prove that consumers will want to shop in a plastic-free aisle.

"So many people complain to me about how they are filling their bins with plastic packaging when they get their food home from the supermarket.

"There is a sea of plastic, most of which will be used just one time and then will be on our planet forever.

"Supermarkets want to give us choice and now we want the choice between buying our food in plastic or not. We need a bold move and we can vote with our wallets."

Every day eight million tonnes of plastic is dumped into oceans and it is estimated by 2050 there will be more plastic by weight in the sea than fish.

Some scientists believe plastics are having an impact on people's health as they become exposed to chemicals such as phthalate and BPA - an industrial chemical used to make plastics - which may cause cancer, metabolic and cognitive behaviour disorders.

A Plastic Planet is calling for people to video themselves on their phone saying, "I am a plastic addict but I am ready for change. I want a plastic-free aisle", and post it on their website aplasticplanet.com

Updated

A Kimberley man has escaped jail for roasting and eating a puppy on the banks of the Fitzroy River.

Passers-by watched in horror as a 28-year-old man killed the puppy with a blunt steak knife, then roasted it on a campfire and ate it.

They phoned police, saying it appeared the animal suffered a slow and painful death.

The court was told he committed the act because he was hungry.

The man was charged with ill-treating an animal contrary to the Welfare Act, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in jail and a $50,000 fine.

After a year of counselling, the Fitzroy Crossing Magistrate yesterday fined him $2,500, which is just above the minimum penalty.

Then I have the perfect gift for her – though on second thoughts, perhaps this is a treat best left until after her nuptials when, one hopes, your friend will miraculously recover her mislaid sense of humour. Adrian Tomine, author of the brilliant Shortcomings and a cartoonist at the New Yorker, has written a "prenuptial memoir" called Scenes from an Impending Marriage in which he lays bare, with ruthless efficiency, the bizarre effect that organising a wedding can have on even the sane and the cynical (and Tomine, as fans will know, is nothing if not cynical). Is it accurate? Yes, as a laser. Is it hilarious? All I can say is that it will make you – if not your good pal Bridezilla – snort like a dragon. Don't, on any account, combine reading it with lunch.

Tomine's specialist subject is angst and alienation among young bohemians; his characters wear heavy spectacles and cool sneakers, they eat a lot of takeout, and they worry excessively about fitting in. It's a world he knows well: Tomine has never flinched from the idea that much of what he writes and draws is thinly disguised autobiography. But because he's so devastatingly observant, he cannot be anything other than hardest on himself. Scenes from an Impending Marriage is more of the same, really, only this time it's explicit: the book began its life when his fiancee, Sarah, begged him to draw a miniature comic book for their guests as a wedding "favour". I wonder what those guests think now. One of the book's funniest sections is about who one invites to a wedding, and why. His list, compared with hers, is tiny. "Come on!" he yells, in a funk before they've even begun. "We've gotta break this endless cycle of obligation and reciprocity!"

It's all here: from choosing a venue, to picking a DJ, to registering for a wedding list ("It's emblematic of our whole culture: 'I want lots of stuff and I want to shoot a gun!'" observes Adrian in Crate & Barrel, where couples must use a barcode scanner to compile their list). There is even a section entitled: "An Even-Handed Acknowledgment of Both Families' Cultural Heritage",

In 1969, a New Jersey rock musician named Karl Uphoff received a phone call from his grandmother; nothing unusual about that you might think, but Karl's Gran had passed away two days earlier. Karl was eighteen at the time of the phantom call, and there had always been a special bond between him and his Gran, who was deaf. She used to phone up Karl's friends and ask: 'Is Karl There?' but because she knew she wouldn't be able to hear the reply, Karl's Gran would then say, 'Tell him to come home at once.' Karl's friends were always irritated by the deaf old woman's constant calling, and used to tell Karl he shouldn't have given his Gran their phone numbers.

One day Karl's Gran passed away and the teenager was naturally upset, but he had no leanings towards spiritualism, and obviously never expected to hear from his Gran ever again. But Karl was wrong. One evening in 1969, Karl was with his friends in the basement of an apartment in Montclair, New Jersey, when the mother of his friend came down and said that Karl was wanted on the phone. When Karl went upstairs he talked to the old woman and realised he was talking to his Gran, who had recently died. Before he could ask her how she could talk to him when she was dead, the woman hung up. Many more calls followed, but on each occasion, when Karl's Gran was asked how she was still able to communicate, or what the 'other side' was like, the old woman would hang up. In the end, the calls stopped, but Karl felt that his Gran was still watching over him.

Another chilling phone call from beyond the grave allegedly occurred in Wilmslow, Cheshire in 1977, when a young woman named Mary Meredith received a call at her home from her cousin Shirley in Manchester. Mary shuddered when she heard Shirley's voice on what sounded like a bad line, because only minutes before, Mary had received a telephone call from her aunt telling her of Shirley's tragic death in a car crash just an hour ago. Again, before the phantom caller could be questioned, she hung up.

"This IGF nomination has made me real snooty," Hofmeier continues. "It's going to get bad here for a second. The idea of Cart Life and the reason I wanted to use the pixel aesthetic is not arbitrary and it's not entirely nostalgic. Pixels - the large, rectangular hallmark of pixel art - do something that parallels what the rest of the game does in its gesture.

"You have the human eye, infinitely complex and mysterious and beautiful, represented by a single black dot. That simplification, as profane as it is, taking all that nuance and beauty and summating it with a single black rectangle, and then getting entire expressions for these characters this way? The difference between the human face and this pixel grid is infinite, but we can bridge the gap. We can fill in their details with our own lives. This is why I wanted to use pixels for the game.

"What Cart Life does with the human face, it does for the whole human experience, hopefully. That's the intention. Even though you get really clumsy, overt, roughly cut-corners standing in for drinking coffee, falling asleep, having a dream - these single evidence hallmarks of these characters' day-to-day lives - hopefully you can fill them in with your own experiences. Everybody knows what it's like to be hungry or exhausted or worried about money. Everybody I know anyways. Filling in those blanks is just the same as what you're doing with the pixel faces. It's an invitation. In a way it's asking the player to do even more work with me, so together between the two of us we can observe something more true than would have been possible otherwise."

Interestingly, I hadn't actually asked Hofmeier why he chose a pixelly 8-bit aesthetic for Cart Life, but that's the joy of interviewing someone with such a fidgety, wide-ranging mind. He's like a fruit machine for insights and asides, spilling out cogent little chunks of thought on everything from polyphasic sleeping (he's tried it, on the backseat of a 1991 Toyota Camry) to Tristram Shandy (a fan, inevitably) and the best approach

<|begin_of_text|>A survey by Comedy Central UK last year showed that parents embarrass their children, on average, a staggering 14 times a week. Pretty much everything about parental behaviour appears to be painfully humiliating these days, from “their age” to “their hobbies”, from “their dance moves” to the undeniable fact that they are, most of the time, “generally uncool”.

The worst offence, however, is the things parents say in public, whether it is shouting “I love you” at the school gate or telling their teenagers off in front of their friends.

In Norway, 15-year-old Martin Odegaard does not appear to have this problem. A few weeks ago his dad, Hans Erik, told the press that “more than 30 [of the best clubs in Europe] have made an inquiry” about his son. Whatever the opposite to embarrassing is for a 15-year-old, that comment probably sums it up. Which football loving boy or girl would not love to hear one of their parents say something like that?

That was on 30 July and the 15-year-old had, by then, started a mere four Norwegian league games for Stromsgodset, the club his father played for too. Since then, the interest in Odegaard has exploded. He has become a YouTube sensation and been interviewed by the international press. He has been called up by the Norway coach, Per-Mathias Hogmo, and is on Wednesday set to become the youngest ever player to represent his country, beating Tormod Kjellsen’s 104-year-old record.

It is, at this point, important to point out that Hogmo’s squad for the friendly against United Arab Emirates in Stavanger includes only one player playing abroad and, when the big guns return for the game against England next week, Odegaard will not keep his place (unless he is a late addition). The 15-year-old is not quite among the 23 best players in the country. Not just yet.

To the clubs (or vultures, whichever way you see it) circling around Odegaard, it does not matter. Last weekend, against Stabaek, more than 30 clubs had representatives at the Marienlyst Stadion to watch him play – among them, reportedly, Real Madrid and Liverpool. Stromsgodset lost 3-2 and there has, predictably and understandably, been a debate in Norway on whether such extreme exposure is good for such a young player. As someone pointed out

The November election may be months away, but Ohioans are already preparing to cast their votes on many issues — including whether to legalize a form of medical treatment that's used in more than a dozen states and Washington D.C.

"I couldn't sleep. I couldn't stand. I couldn't sit. There's no position you can place yourself in where you're comfortable," said Cynthia Wynia, who has used marijuana for pain management.

Wynia says her pain as a result of spine problems was unbearable.

After undergoing three rounds of physical therapy, several Cortizone injections, and surgery, nothing seemed to be working.

Then, she was given a different kind of treatment.

"A friend of mine offered me some marijuana," said Wynia. The results, she says, were unlike anything she had ever tried.

"It took me a while to realize it. I was getting up and down. I was going up stairs. I was moving around — dancing. It didn't hurt. I said 'I do not hurt'," said Wynia.

She only used the drug once, but was pain-free for the first time in years and feels marijuana should be legalized for medical reasons. Not everyone agrees.

"It's an ever-changing drug, and it's not really a benign drug. It's a drug that we need to look at very carefully that causes a lot of harm to our society," said Marcie Seidel, executive director of Drug-Free Action Alliance.

Seidel says the uncertainty of marijuana's side effects make it difficult to be used as legitimate medicine.

"I don't know of any other drug in our repertoire of medications where you take it and you know only what it might do, but you have no idea what the side effects are," said Seidel.

She's says alarmed by marijuana's integration into mainstream society. "In a prevention world, we know that whenever you take away the perception that something is harmful, use will go up."

For Wynia, the benefits of using marijuana for those suffering from extreme pain far outweigh any negatives.

"It has its uses, it has its misuses, just like any other substance. If this can relieve pain from people who cannot find relief in any other way, there is no reason not to legalize it for medical use," said Wynia.

Signatures are still being gathered to put medical marijuana on the Ohio ballot.

The deadline is July 4.

Sixteen states currently classify marijuana as legal for medical treatment.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>In January 1848, a work crew at John Sutter’s mill, near Sacramento, California, came across a few select nuggets of gold. Before long, a half-million prospectors arrived there seeking instant riches. The gold rush was on. Some 153 years later, another gold rush broke out at an old mine called Red Lake, in northwestern Ontario. This time, the fortune hunters wielded geological-modeling software and database mining tools rather than picks and shovels. The big winners were from Australia. And they had never even seen the mine.

Rob McEwen, chairman and CEO of Goldcorp Inc., based in Toronto, had triggered the gold rush by issuing an extraordinary challenge to the world’s geologists: We’ll show you all of our data on the Red Lake mine online if you tell us where we’re likely to find the next 6 million ounces of gold. The prize: a total of $575,000, with a top award of $105,000.

The mining community was flabbergasted. “We’ve seen very large data sets from government surveys online,” says Nick Archibald, managing director of Fractal Graphics, the winning organization from West Perth, Australia. “But for a company to post that information and say, ‘Here I am, warts and all,’ is quite unusual indeed.”

McEwen knew that the contest, which he called the Goldcorp Challenge, entailed big risks. For one thing, it exposed the company to a hostile-takeover bid. But the risks of continuing to do things the old way were even greater. “Mining is one of humanity’s oldest industrial pursuits,” McEwen says. “This is old old economy. But a mineral discovery is like a technological discovery. There’s the same rapid creation of wealth as rising expectations improve profitability. If we could find gold faster, we could really improve the value of the company.”

McEwen, a small, soft-spoken man with a neatly trimmed mustache and meticulous tailoring, had one big advantage over his slow-footed competitors: He wasn’t a miner, he didn’t think like a miner, and he wasn’t constrained by a miner’s conventional wisdom. As a young man, he went to work for Merrill Lynch, following his father into the investment business. But his father also had a fascination with gold, and McEwen grew up hearing tales of miners, prospectors, and grubstakes at the dinner table. Soon he was bitten by the gold bug too

But Fu broke with tradition, showing her own happiness at her performance.

Over the past year more than 500 workers in four factories supplying to Nike, Puma, Asics and VF Corporation were hospitalised. The most serious episode, recorded over three days in November, saw 360 workers collapse. The brands confirmed the incidents, part of a pattern of faintings that has dogged the 600,000-strong mostly female garment workforce for years.

A journey across four continents: Danziger's tales from Cambodia | Rory MacLean Read more

The Observer and Danwatch, a Danish investigative media group, interviewed workers, unions, doctors, charities and government officials in the country’s garment industry, worth $5.7bn in 2015.

The women who collapsed worked 10 hour days, six days a week and reported feeling exhausted and hungry. Excessive heat was also an issue in three factories, with temperatures of 37C. Unlike in neighbouring Vietnam, where factory temperatures must not exceed 32C, Cambodia sets no limit, though if temperatures reach a “very high level” causing difficulties for workers, employers must install fans or air conditioning.

According to unions, short-term contracts – common for workers in three of the factories – were also a key source of stress and exhaustion.

If workers are fainting, it should be a clear indication that you need to do something more drastic Bent Gehrt, Worker Rights Consortium

The minimum monthly wage in Cambodia is £120 and two hours’ overtime a day boosts it to between £150 and £190, depending on the factory. Wages vary, but none of the four factories pays the “living wage”, which in Cambodia is £300 a month, according to the workers’ rights alliance Asia Floor Wage.

Bent Gehrt, south-east Asia field director for the Worker Rights Consortium, which monitors factories making clothing for US universities, said: “There is no proper investment in an adequate working environment and no investment in the living wage. If workers are fainting, it should be a clear indication you need to do something more drastic.”

Short-term contracts were a “root cause” of job insecurity, he added, meaning people cannot refuse overtime: “Workers say if you don’t do overtime, you won’t get your contract renewed.”

Mass collapses bring factories to a standstill and cost “hundreds of thousands” of pounds in lost productivity, according to the Garment Makers Association in Cambodia. A factory

Passengers were stranded on a plane on the tarmac at Gatwick Airport for more than eight hours after fog caused their flight to be diverted.

The Air India flight was on its way from Mumbai to Heathrow Airport when the weather conditions forced it to divert to Gatwick at about 08:00 BST.

It resumed its journey at 17:00 BST, arriving at Heathrow 20 minutes later.

A spokesman for the Sussex airport said the airline had to wait for a crew before it could complete its journey.

Sussex Police were called to the flight to prevent a breach of the peace as tempers among passengers flared.

'No food'

A BBC World Service reporter on board said the mood on the plane became heated.

Rahul Joglekar said he did not know why the passengers were prevented from disembarking the aircraft.

Air India was unavailable for comment.

Mr Shorey said: "I don't understand why we were diverted then not allowed to leave. I felt I was already home, I was in London, I didn't mind the extra hassle of coming from Gatwick into London."

Jas Johal, who was also on the plane, said: "There were promises of food and refreshments on board. Everyone was very hungry. There was no sign of any food. I myself asked them several times, then they brought out some more crisps and Coke."

He added: "By this time, after almost eight hours without any food, people were willing to lose their calmness."

Passenger Victoria Denham said she would be complaining to the airline and seeking compensation for the delay.

Anyone who has seen Ratatouille knows the famous scene when the movie’s namesake dish mentally transports a restaurant critic back to his childhood. Tex-Mex has the same effect on many longtime Houstonians.

Truthfully, there are a lot of things to not like about the mess that we call “the combination dinner.” There’s too much salt, grease and no vegetables to speak of amid a wealth of artery-clogging cheese and meat. If an alien was dropped into Texas and served up a big ol’ mess of Tex-Mex, he might ask, “What the heck is this on my plate?”

But for those of us who grew up here, Tex-Mex seems very right and we love it. As a kid, my family ate at an El Patio on Telephone at Park Place at least twice a week.

Traditional combo plates include frijoles refritos (refried beans), arroz a la Mexicana (Mexican rice) and “gravy” made with flour, oil and chili powder to cover the enchiladas and tamales. Tortillas for enchiladas are dipped in hot oil to soften and then stacked until ready to use. The rice is slightly red from tomatoes, seasoned with cumin and—hopefully—light and fluffy. The beans—usually made from pinto beans cooked until very soft—may be watery or slightly thick. Very lucky diners will get to enjoy a fried taco shell that’s puffy, crispy and inflated like a balloon. (Los Tios and Fiesta Loma Linda are the only places that I know of that still do these).

Updated, 7/24/2017: By reader request, here’s a map of all 12 old-school Tex-Mex restaurants recommended in this article.

Here’s a list of 12 places that, if one could time-travel back to 1960s Houston, feature the combination plates that would have been served.

This happened to me recently when I was listening to The Tom Woods Show, and Michael Malice described what might happen when Donald Trump debates Hillary Clinton.

Despite demographic trends, I have sensed that Trump had a shot to defeat her. But I have struggled to find a way to explain how “magic” can beat “math.” Well, one way this could happen would be for there to be a big moment. This could come in the form of some sort of disaster (like a terrorist attack, God forbid), or it could simply come in the form of a knockout punch. (Trump is unlikely to win if the fight goes the distance and relies on the judges’ scorecard, but I could imagine Hillary choking, and Trump triumphing.)

Michael Malice provides us with one hypothetical example of how this might occur during one of the presidential debates.

And she’s going to look weak and pathetic. He’s going to dare her to say ‘I dare you to say Islamic Fundamentalist Terrorism,’ and she’ll either obey him and look weak, or refuse and look cowardly. And — this is the one — I’m predicting this one right now: If she has one of his coughing fits on stage, he is going to attack her rapid fire. And she’s literally going to be unable to speak. And he’s going to say things like, ‘Look, she’s dying in front of us.’ ‘Look, I like grammas, but they should be in a home, not the president.’ ‘She’s weak. She’s pathetic.’ … And he’s like: ‘Let’s take a break, cause she needs a breather. This woman is not well.’ That will be the moment that destroys her campaign. He’s going to eat her alive in those debates. And, as you know, most people in the middle don’t care about ideology.

1.1 'TRUE' LOVE

Imagine a film script containing the following scene:

Sun, sea, a deserted beach, a man, and a woman. The man Darling, you're so quiet. Anything wrong?

The woman It's nothing.

He Come on, tell me, what is it?

She I don't know how to make you understand.

He How to make me understand what?

She (After a pause) I want to leave you.

He Another man?

She Yes.

He Are you sure you love him?

She Yes.

He More than you love me?

She I can't go on without him.

He (Puts his arm around her) How wonderful.

She What did you say?

He I said, that's wonderful. Go ahead — with him.

She You're glad?

He Why shouldn't I be?

She Then you no longer love me?

He On the contrary.

She You still love me?

He I love you, so I want you to be happy. What did you expect?

At this point in the scenario, if not sooner, the producer reading it picks up his phone and dials the author.

'Are you out of your mind?' he asks. He had ordered a love scene, but this certainly was no imaginable love scene, was it? In a real love scene the man would at this point crack his wife's skull, or at least give a good imitation of doing it. Then, he would leap into his car, drive off with tires screeching, to beat up his rival.

But the author is not inclined to make any changes. If the man really loves his wife, he would behave as outlined in the script. True love is selfless by definition.

If the producer is willing to debate the matter, the discussion would presumably turn on their being two kinds of love: forgiving or vengeful, self-sacrificing or possessive, the love that gives or the love that takes...

Is it so? Are there really two kinds of love, opposite in nature, between a man and a woman? Or is only one of these the real thing, the other a fake?

How is it possible that an experience every adult must have had at least once in his life, a phenomenon thoroughly explored by generations of psychoanalysts, the favorite age-old theme of writers, composers, artists, can still be the subject of so much misunderstanding?

"Let me see if I understand your thesis. You think we shouldn't anthropomorphize people?"

-- Sidney Morgenbesser to B. F. Skinner

Behaviorism was the doctrine that it was unscientific for a psychologist to ascribe emotions, beliefs, thoughts, to a human being. After all, you can't directly observe anger or an intention to hit someone. You can only observe the punch. You may hear someone say "I'm angry!" but that's hearing a verbal behavior, not seeing anger. Thoughts are not observable, therefore they are unscientific, therefore they do not exist. Oh, you think you're thinking, but that's just a delusion - or it would be, if there were such things as delusions.

This was before the day of computation, before the concept of information processing, before the "cognitive revolution" that led to the modern era. If you looked around for an alternative to behaviorism, you didn't find, "We're going to figure out how the mind processes information by scanning the brain, reading neurons, and performing experiments that test our hypotheses about specific algorithms." You found Freudian psychoanalysis. This may make behaviorism a bit more sympathetic.

Part of the origin of behaviorism, was in a backlash against substance dualism - the idea that mind is a separate substance from ordinary physical phenomena. Today we would say, "The apparent specialness comes from the brain doing information-processing; a physical deed to be sure, but one of a different style from smashing a brick with a sledgehammer." The behaviorists said, "There is no mind." (John B. Watson, founder of behaviorism, in 1928.)

The behaviorists outlawed not just dualistic mind-substance, but any such things as emotions and beliefs and intentions (unless defined in terms of outward behavior). After all, science had previously done away with angels, and de-gnomed the haunted mine. Clearly the method of reason, then, was to say that things didn't exist. Having thus fathomed the secret of science, the behaviorists proceeded to apply it to the mind.

You might be tempted to say, "What fools! Obviously, the mind, like the rainbow, does exist; it is to be explained, not explained away. Saying 'the subject is angry' helps me predict the subject; the belief pays its rent. The hypothesis of anger is no different from any other scientific hypothesis."

They played in Candlestick Park, so renowned for it's frosty nights that every fan that stayed to the end of extra inning night games got a pin commending them, the croix de candlestick (which said in Latin "I came, I saw, I survived.) IT was so bad that a poll of the fans in 1984 found that almost 80 percent of them would boo a mascot if the Giants got one. This lead to one of the most anarchic and anti-marketing ideas in the increasingly anti-septic sports marketing world, the Crazy Crab. Tonight, the Giants are giving out Crazy Crab bobble-heads at their game. I want one. Bad.

First off, a disclaimer, in 1984 a young Ezra was hired to be a voice in a 30 second radio spot for the Crab. I believe my only line was "I hate that stupid crab." I did not. Not really.

See, hating the crab was the whole idea. The Giants took the fans orneriness and used it as a marketing tool. The Crab announced it was a Dodgers fan (a virtual death sentence at the Stick in the 80s) and even did some radio and TV interviews in LA (calling the Giants a "classless organization.) The crab also taunted players, "trashed" their lockers, and (in a stirring return) got on the PA system at the next to last game at the Stick and announced that he hoped the Dodgers won the series. Heck, he even cheered for the umps! The Giants marketing department actively pushed for fans to hate the anti-mascot and it worked better than they could have imagined.

The actor in the crab suit was in no small jeopardy when he showed up during games. Fans threw batteries, beers and anything else they could find at him when he went into the stands. The Giant's manager, Frank Robinson, had to be restrained from going after the Crab in one game (he was clearly not in on the joke) and players routinely tried to hit him in batting practice. As Giants pitcher and broadcaster Mike Krukow says "It was a more sophisticated baseball fan, but a less sophisticated person that came to games back then." One story has the handler who went around with the crab in the stands having to assure the actor that no one in the audience had a gun.

The success of the Crab (despite the danger to the person) was in drawing attention

<|begin_of_text|>“ITS GETTIN HOT IN HERE”

The Montreal Metro is busy, very busy, it ranks 1st in Canada and 3rd across North America behind New York and Mexico City. STM moves over 1.2 million unlinked passenger trips every day (as of Q1 2014).[1]

According to STM In 2010 the number of total passengers moved was at 7 BILLION

So what if we could load balance this Metro system just like we do on computer networks?

Although this idea can be utilized across the network and beyond, for now, lets focus on one section, Montmorency to Berri UQAM, and the time slot 7:00 to 9am. For those that are not familiar with our super Metro, its the Orange line that goes from an area called Laval. Laval has the highest number of commuters each day.

I've been riding this section for a few years now, and many times i play the game of, Can we make this service more enjoyable for people?

So what got me playing this game and why am I writing this?

Well here’s how my experience unfolded when I first uncounted the STM Rush Hour on the orange line,

Paul to Brain— “Yay! metro comes every 2 minutes, thats awesome”….10 mins later

Brain to Paul……in Yoda voice — Deceived you have been my friend” Wow, yes….big deception.

Train arrives, doors open and….well, not much happens, aside from people looking at each other from opposite sides, saying in their respective minds, the following

Train — “Don’t you even think about squeezing yourself on this train” <—>

Platform — “Come on people I can see space between your legs, i’ll go there, i am not picky, I’m in a big rush to get somewhere” —

No shit buddy… Perhaps the rush hour commuters are in a rush also, otherwise it’s some new METRO FETISH S&TM suffocation thing that’s super popular(oof, out of breath), well its possible, our magic city is so freaking beautifully diverse. Anyway I digress, this kind of trade off between fellow citizens repeats itself over and over across multiple stops, with many people in offices across Montreal hearing the words …..

“Sorry I’am late, I had to let 5 trains carrying sardines pass me by.”

Furthermore, the whole on-boarding and disembarking is negative points against the so many awesome things

<|begin_of_text|>For Hamilton fans asking “what comes next?” after the Broadway smash’s most recent King George, Rory O’Malley, performed his last show Sunday, Taran Killam has an answer.

The former Saturday Night Live star, who will take over the role starting on Tuesday, shared a photo of himself in the mad king’s regal wardrobe on Instagram Monday.

“King me. Tomorrow’s forecast: Reign. #Ramilton,” the star punnily captioned the image.

While you might be saying, “I know him,” it’s not from Broadway — Killam will be making his Great White Way debut in the hip-hop musical, though he is an experienced musical theater actor. And if you’re perplexed and wondering if they’re going to keep on replacing whoever’s in charge, the answer is yes: Killam will be the fifth actor to wear the crown, after Brian d’Arcy James, Jonathan Groff, Andrew Rannells, and O’Malley.

On Saturday, the production shared a digital #Ham4Ham video of Killam’s “coronation,” as O’Malley steps aside to play the monarch on the show’s first national tour and Killam ascends the throne in the Richard Rodgers Theatre.

Groff previously performed the same ritual in April, when O’Malley assumed the role.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Livestock account for a significant amount of Austalian emissions

Australian scientists have said they are hoping to breed sheep that burp less as part of efforts to tackle climate change.

The scientists have been trying to identify a genetic link that causes some sheep to belch less than others.

Burping is a far greater cause of emissions in sheep than flatulence, they say.

About 16% of Australia's greenhouse emissions come from agriculture, says the department of climate change.

Australia's Sheep Cooperative Research Council says 66% of agricultural emissions are released as methane from the gut of livestock.

"Ninety per cent of the methane that sheep and cattle and goats produce comes from the rumen, and that's burped out," John Goopy from the New South Wales Department of Industry and Investment told ABC.

"Not much goes behind - that's horses."

The scientists in New South Wales have been conducting experiments in specially designed pens where they measure how much gas sheep emit by burping.

They have found, from tests on 200 sheep so far, that the more they eat, the more they belch.

But even taking that into account, there appear to be "significant differences" between individual animals, Mr Goopy said.

The scientists' goal in the long term is to breed sheep that produce less methane, which produces many times more global warming than carbon dioxide.

"We're looking for natural variations so we'll steer the population that way, " said Roger Hegarty, from the Sheep Cooperative Research Council.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>
