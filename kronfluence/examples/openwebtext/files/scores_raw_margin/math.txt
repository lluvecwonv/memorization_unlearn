What is 7 times 8? I have posted a math trick so you’ll never forget the answer. You can multiply any two numbers from 6 to 10 using your two hands!

Multiply Numbers Between 6 to 10 On Your Fingers

There is a mathematical reason why this method is sound.

Multiply Numbers Between 6 to 10 On Your Fingers – Why It Works

I recommend watching the videos as the examples illustrate the method very clearly.

I’ve written up a short summary after the jump.

Multiply On Your Hands

Imagine numbering your fingers from 6 to 10, going from your thumb to your pinky finger on each hand.

Line up your fingers for the two numbers you want to multiply. If you want to multiply 7 by 8, line up your left index finger with your right middle finger.

Count the two fingers that are touching and the fingers below them. This tells you the tens digit of your answer.

Then count the fingers above the touching fingers on each left and right hands. Multiply those two numbers. That becomes the units digit of the answer.

For 7 times 8, you will find 5 fingers are touching and below, and then there will be 3×2 = 6 as the units digit. This gives an answer of 56.

And this works for any two numbers between 6 and 10!

Occasionally you will have to carry-over. When you do 6×7, you will find there are 3 fingers touching or below (to make 30), then then you will find there are 4×3 = 12 units. So you need to add up 30 and 12 to get 42.

I hope you like this trick!

As a first step toward a much grander Clojure project I needed a unification library to supplement a simple logic engine (the second step in the larger plan). There are a few options floating around, but nothing that was readily available nor complete. Therefore, I decided to package a simple unification library in hopes that others might find it useful and hopefully eliminate the need to search around fruitlessly like I did. A basic use case for Unifycle is as follows:

[sourcecode lang=”clojure” gist=”599021″](use ‘[me.fogus.unifycle :only [unifier]])

;; unify two expressions with an occurs check

(unifier ‘((?a *?x ** 2) + (?b *?x) +?c) ‘(?z + (4 * 5) + 3))

;=> ((?a * 5 ** 2) + (4 * 5) + 3)[/sourcecode]

Unifycle exposes a number of canned functions, starting with unifier, try-subst, and garner-unifiers. These functions use an occurs check internally, so use them with that fact in mind. I have also exposed versions of these functions without internal occurs check named unifier-, try-subst-, and garner-unifiers-. If you know what unification is then you know what an occurs check is — if not, then this whole post is probably moot.

I have also exposed factory functions named make-occurs-unify-fn, make-occurs-subst-fn, make-occurs-unifier-fn, make-unify-fn, make-subst-fn, and make-unifier-fn. The first three create versions using and occurs check and the last three create versions without. Each of these factory functions take a single predicate function that is used to determine if a symbol in a (potentially) unified expression refers to a variable. From the example above, you’ll notice that the default variable function is preceded with a question mark (e.g.?snigglet ).

I have created a documentation page for Unifycle that I plan to expand. Any and all help is appreciated.

But don’t be fooled: It’s still one-way traffic for the server.

Even though the returner has won 40 per cent (two of five) of the points played so far in the game, his chance of breaking serve is still less than 10 per cent.

An Infosys ATP Beyond The Numbers analysis of the current Top 10 players in the Emirates ATP Rankings shows that, since the start of the 2015 season, they have held serve from 40/30 92.7 per cent (6331/6826) of the time.

The player who has been the toughest to break when leading 40/30 on serve is Roger Federer, who has held a dominant 95.4 per cent (535/561) of the time from this seemingly competitive point score.

Current Top 10: Holding from 40/30 since the start of the 2015 season

Federer: Past Three Seasons Holding From 40/30

2017 = 96.3% (157/163)

2016 = 95.5% (107/112)

2015 = 94.7% (271/286)

Even worse news for his opponents: Federer has slightly improved in this specific category during the past three seasons. This year, he's led 40/30 during 163 service games and has lost only six of those games. Opponents must feel like they are getting closer to capturing Federer’s serve, but in reality, they are farther away from breaking than they were at 0/0.

Infosys Nia Data shows that in 2017 Federer is holding serve 91 per cent of the time, but at 40/30, he is holding 96.3 per cent (157/163) of the time. The returner winning two points in the service game doesn’t trump the fact that Federer needs just one more point to hold. When the Swiss star has surged ahead 40/15 this season, his win percentage has elevated to a near-perfect 99.1 per cent (229/231).

Marin Cilic is the second best performer of current Top 10 players, holding serve from 40/30 94.6 per cent (596/630) of the time since the beginning of the 2015 season. Former World No. 1s

Sonos is wildly popular for a reason. We in the tech biz toss the term “wireless multiroom audio” around a lot, but what Sonos really does is put great-sounding music in every corner of your home or business — and they make it dead simple. We like to think of Sonos as the audio company Apple wishes it could be — one that gives you amazing sound that “just works.” So what could possibly raise our enthusiasm about the company and its wares? We have the answer for you here in our Sonos One review.

Sonos isn’t alone in this game any longer. Alexa came along and blew the home speaker floodgates wide open. With its open digital assistant platform, Amazon was able not only to popularize its own speaker products, but also to see to it that Alexa started popping up everywhere and controlling everything. Today, if your product doesn’t work with Alexa, it’s considered behind the times. What’s more, Google was prodded to get in on the action and is now pushing its own line of speakers.

Sonos had to pivot, and pivot it has. In October, Sonos announced the Sonos One, a reimagined version of its popular Play:1 speaker that’s built to be the smartest smart speaker on the market. Out of the box, the Sonos One supports Amazon’s Alexa, but the company promises Google Assistant will come to the One sometime in 2018. Follow below to find out if the company’s latest effort to even further simplify whole-home audio is as successful as it sounds.

Out of the box

Dan Baker/Digital Trends

Sonos long ago perfected its out-of-box experience, drawing inspiration from the folks at Apple and making it all its own. Inside the Sonos Play One box, you’ll find a simple setup card, information on downloading and setting up Amazon’s Alexa app, and a clever sort of “dial” meant to inform and inspire you to tell Alexa how to get music going in your home.

Setup

We’ve been praising Sonos for its foolproof setup process, and we’re going to go ahead and keep heaping on the kudos. Figuring out how to seamlessly integrate Amazon’s Alexa assistant and app into its ecosystem is something the company says it pored over for months — and it shows. The process is, like all things Sonos, dead simple.

— Dogs are being stolen out of cars, yards, off sidewalks and even out of shelters at an alarming rate, according to the American Kennel Club.

“It only takes a minute for a theft to occur,” American Kennel Club spokeswoman Lisa Peterson told CBS 2’s Dave Carlin on Friday.

Making any pet owner think twice is surveillance video from last week that showed “Marley” the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel being menaced by a stranger, who picked up the frightened dog and walked off with him, leaving 7-year-old Mia Bendrat heartbroken the day before Christmas.

“You knew that was somebody’s dog and it was Christmas Eve. I mean really?” Bendrat said.

Marley was sold to a woman in Greenwich Village, who thought the situation was fishy.

Marley was checked for a microchip and Mia and her best friend were reunited.

But happy endings are rare as dognapping cases rise nationwide by almost 70 percent, according to the American Kennel Club.

“Last year for example we tracked more than 432 pet thefts and that’s just scratching the surface,” Peterson said. “For the first time ever we’ve seen a trend now where shelters are being broken into and purebred and mixed breed dogs are being stolen.”

Dognappings from stores, shelters and backyards and off sidewalks are preventable.

Experts say to safeguard your pet as you would a child.

“Don’t leave it unattended,” Peterson said.

There are products available so you don’t let your pet out of your sight.

The American Kennel Club recommends doing anything you can do, but most importantly to get your pet microchipped.

“Because that’s the only way you can prove ownership and get your dog back should it turn up at a vets office or shelter,” Peterson said.

And if you are running errands, experts advise keeping your pets home to stop making things so easy for a new breed of criminals.

The American Kennel Club tracked 432 pet thefts in 2011, compared to 255 thefts in 2010.

The Helix Bridge provides a pedestrian connection across the head of the Singapore River between the city’s existing CBD and its new Bayfront district. Its commission was the result of a selected 36-entry international design competition held in 2006.

The plan concept was to curve the bridge in an arc so that it arrives fluidly into foreshore promenades on each side. It also enabled the bridge to connect in its centre to an adjacent vehicular bridge’s footpath while shifting away from it beyond this point of junction.

Seeking a delicate, lightweight contrast to the vehicular bridge, the concept evolved of a double helix structure. This form enabled the canopy, required by the brief, to be integrated as segmented panels of glass and perforated steel, unlike other bridge structures. The structural typology also proved highly effective in working to a curvilinear plan, and in generating an intriguing sense of movement flow along the journey.

The Helix Bridge is illuminated at night by ribbons of LED lighting accentuating the interplay of the two helix tubes and their intervening, connecting ties. Four ovular-shaped ‘pods’ cantilever out from the structure enabling people to gain wider appreciation of the bridge form and providing gathering space for viewing bay events. Conceptual Framework The design of The Helix Bridge responds to the brief of an international architectural competition calling for a unique structural form that could be symbolic of Singapore’s goal of promoting the identity of Asia’s ‘connected city’. The plan concept was to curve the bridge away from an adjoining linear vehicular bridge, such that it touched at a point for pedestrian interconnection, yet descended in each direction to fluidly continue along existing prom

<|begin_of_text|>Netflix Inc. (NFLX) is a video streaming giant that provides more than 100 million users with syndicated as well as original TV shows and movies. Since its humble beginnings as a mail-order movie and TV show delivery service in 1997, the company has come a long way, effectively killing its biggest competitor Blockbuster Entertainment. Netflix went public on May 23, 2002, and an investment of $990 on Netflix's initial public offering, or IPO, date of May 23, 2002, would have generated over $310,000 after stock splits. that's a gain of 31,260%

Early Investment in Netflix

If you invested $990 right after Netflix's IPO, assuming you purchased each share of Netflix at its IPO price of $15, you would have 66 shares. Netflix did not continue higher; instead, it traded in a downtrend until early October 2002, where it hit a low of $4.85. But things turned around for the company and the early investors.

2004 Two-for-One Netflix Stock Split

On Feb. 11, 2004, Netflix closed at $71.96 per share. On Feb. 12, 2004, Netflix issued a two-for-one stock split, so those 66 shares would double to become 132 shares. On Feb. 12, 2005, Netflix closed at $37.30 per share. The investment of $990 would have been worth $4923.60, a return on investment, ROI, of 397%.

Thereafter, Netflix had its ups and downs but overall the stock kept climbing crossing one price milestone after another.

2015 Seven-for-One Netflix Stock Split

Nearly 11 years later, Netflix reported its quarterly earnings and shares made a new all-time high. The company was announced another stock split, this time, a seven-for-one stock split, on July 15, 2015. On July 15, 2015, your 132 shares would become 924 shares. On the date of the stock split, Netflix closed at $98.13 per share. The total position was worth $90,672.12 at the close, a 9058% increase over the initial investment amount.

Thanks for the confidence guys, it's appreciated. I'd like to get as much feedback as possible in order to reach a consensus on the direction we should take going forward as far as future hardware purchases go. I favor Bitfury gear due to their efficiency claims and ability to demonstrate progress in their development process. On the other hand I've seen little evidence to convince me that knc will be able to deliver products on their timeline. Does anybody disagree with my take on this and if so why? Also does anybody have any other suggestions as far as which vendor they feel is a better choice and if so why?

Basic knowledge about C programming

CUDA supported device (CUDA GPU list)

Installed CUDA SDK

Eclipse/nvidia nsight (nsight recommended)

2. Goal

The aim of this article is to get acquainted with bilinear interpolation technique and implement demo program which is going to scale given input image using nvidia CUDA SDK. The concept of interpolation is not explained here.

3. Optimus (hybrid graphics card)

What if I have CUDA compatibile device as a secondary graphics card (optimus)?

First of all (if you haven’t done it yet) install Bumblebee deamon.

It’s available on many popular distros, for instance:

# Archlinux pacman -S bumblebee # Ubuntu 12.04 sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install bumblebee virtualgl linux-headers-generic

After reboot perform:

sudo tee /proc/acpi/bbswitch < <<ON modprobe nvidia

Turned on nvidia device will shorten your baterry life 🙂 Be aware of that and plug in.

Let’s consider the situation that we have ARGB pixel located in memory and we want to get out the blue channel. How to do that?

// Declare ARGB variable Uint32 color = 0xffd5b2c4;

Ok! What is that 0xff….??? This is a ARGB color written in hexadecimal form. Hmm… So how to read this?

/* Each of channels (alpha, red, green, blue) has value from 0 to 255. 1 byte is sufficeient to store the number, so on one octet (8 bits) you can write one channel. After decomposition: */ Uint8 a = 0xff; // 255 Uint8 r = 0xd5; // 213 Uint8 g = 0xb2; // 178 Uint8 b = 0xc4; // 196 /* How many bits do we need to store all four channels? 4*8 = 32 bits. Now it's perfectly clear the idea of Uint32 "color" variable. */

Let’s pull out channels from “color” variable

printf("Blue: 0x%02x", (color && 0xff)); printf("Green: 0x%02x", ((color >> 8) && 0xff)); printf("Red: 0x%

Check out this problem:

If that isn't big enough on your screen here, hit the twitchy link to get a bigger picture.

What they're asking kids to do is this: Rather than simply memorize the fact that seven plus seven equals fourteen, they're training kids to recognize possible shortcuts or easier paths to computation. If a kid realizes a seven is made up of 3 plus four, and remembers that three plus seven equals ten, then he can "simplify" the problem as ten plus four, which gives fourteen.

Here's the problem: The shortcut/easier path of computation is actually more complicated than just learning that seven plus seven equals fourteen.

This is Cargo Cult stuff. They did the same thing with their new innovations in Whole Word learning (reading a word at a glance), when they got rid of Phonics (sounding a word out, letter by letter), and doomed a generation to being bad readers.

Here's the Cargo Cult part:

Professional Highly-Educated Education Researchers noted that high-level early readers were usually just identifying words at a glance -- reading in a "whole word" way. While kids using Phonics read more slowly. Phonics kids were slower readers and struggled with it more.

So hey -- let's stop teaching kids this slow method of reading called Phonics and just teach them "Whole Word" reading!!! Win, win, win!!! It's easier for the students, and even easier for the teachers, as they don't have to teach the step-by-step Phonics method of reading. They can just say the word "horse" is horse and keep saying it until these stupid kids start learning that "horse" means horse.

Here's the problem: This is Cargo Cult mneliaty. Yes, the high-lanrneig, early-raednig kids are in fact using the Wlohe Wrod raenidg mhoted, just as you, reading that gibberish I just wrote, employed Whole Word reading -- looking at the first and last letters of the word and using context and years and years of experience in how the written language works, and what words are expected to come in which place in a sentence to read, fairly easily, a bunch of misspelled words as the words I intended.

But the high-learning, early-reading kids are only doing that because they started reading earlier than the other kids. All kids -- including the early readers -- go through the Phonics phase. One of my earliest recollections (maybe

Six years ago, an absolutely devastating tsunami caused a triple meltdown at Japan’s Fukushima nuclear power facility. It was the worst environmental disaster in all of human history, and even though six years have passed since that time, nobody knows where the three melted cores are. Just recently, authorities believe that they spotted some melted fuel underneath reactor 2, but even from a distance the level of nuclear radiation that was detected was being described as “unimaginable”. Essentially what we are talking about are three enormous “dirty bombs” that are continuously emitting tremendous amounts of nuclear radiation into the air, water and soil. Some of the radioactive elements that are being released have half-lives that are measured in tens of thousands of years, and so the poisonous effect of these “dirty bombs” could potentially be with us for generation after generation.

Personally, I don’t know why the big mainstream news outlets in the U.S. are almost entirely ignoring Fukushima these days. Fox News did a story on the “unimaginable” radiation at Fukushima just a few days ago, but that was about it.

To me, it is certainly newsworthy that nuclear radiation inside reactor 2 at Fukushima is at the highest level ever recorded…

Radiation levels inside a damaged reactor at Japan’s Fukushima nuclear plant have hit a record high, and are the worst since the plant suffered a triple meltdown nearly six years ago. The latest readings now pose a serious challenge as officials prepare to dismantle the stricken facility. Radiation levels inside the containment vessel of reactor No. 2 at Fukushima has reached 530 sieverts per hour—a figure described by experts as “unimaginable.”

Previously, the highest level of radiation measured at Fukushima was 73 sieverts per hour, and just a small fraction of that amount would be fatal to most humans…

Needless to say, this plant is not fit for human life. Just one dose of a single sievert is enough to cause radiation sickness and nausea. Exposure to four to five sieverts would kill about half of those exposed to it within a month, while a single dose of 10 sieverts is enough to kill a person within weeks.

At 530 sieverts per hour, the radiation is so intense that even robots can only last for a couple of hours in that environment. The Japanese hope to eventually remove the melted fuel from these reactors someday, but first they have to figure out if it is even possible.

And the truth is that the level of radiation in reactor 2 may actually be far higher

Look at Ms. going full SWERF on us. The hell is this? https://t.co/P7J9NByhI6 — Amadi (@amaditalks) November 4, 2015

Like many feminists, my interest in women’s rights began when I started noticing I was treated like I was less than the men around me. I didn’t analyze much deeper than that — I just needed confirmation that something wasn’t right, I wasn’t imagining it, and it wasn’t my fault. Now that my analysis has gone deeper, and is rooted firmly in an anti-oppression framework, it’s clear to me that when I first started learning and believing in feminism I was, in fact, a liberal feminist.

Liberal feminism provides an individualistic view of women’s rights that holds equality with men as its end goal. Liberal feminism focuses on advancing women’s positions in existing institutions and believes that what women want out of life is what men want and have already secured for themselves.

Way back then, I understood feminism in relation to my life, my experiences, and my choices. I didn’t spend much time considering how my internalized misogyny shaped those choices — even the choices I now see were problematic because they reinforced mechanisms of women’s oppression.

For me, then, and for liberal feminists today, the individual is queen. Any choice a woman makes is, by definition, a feminist choice because choosing is a feminist act. Even choices like pandering to the male gaze or self-objectifying must be applauded. As a result, I often engaged in decidedly unfeminist behaviour while uncritically wrapping myself in a comfortingly progressive label.

Once I began critically examining my beliefs and learning more about the history of feminism, I realized the many ways in which so-called liberal feminism falls short. What soon became clear was that liberal feminism isn’t feminism at all. Uncritically worshipping individual choices ignores the structures and institutions that support patriarchy. Focusing narrowly on advancing in the public sphere ignores the oppression women face in our homes. More worryingly, refusing to examine the context and impacts of our choices allows men and women to continue reinforcing misogyny and male supremacy while patting themselves on the back and failing to work towards liberation for all women in any meaningful way.

Supporting misogynist ideas, behaviours, and structures while declaring yourself a feminist requires a stunning lack of self-awareness and critical thinking, and an intricate set of unquestioned beliefs whose main purpose is

<|begin_of_text|>This beautiful instrument cannot be tuned. Image: Gryffindor, via Wikimedia Commons. CC BY-SA 3.0.

The integers are a unique factorization domain, so we can’t tune pianos. That is the saddest thing I know about the integers.

I talked to a Girl Scout troop about math earlier this month, and one of our topics was the intersection of math and music. I chose to focus on the way we perceive ratios of sound wave frequencies as intervals. We interpret frequencies that have the ratio 2:1 as octaves. (Larger frequencies sound higher.) We interpret frequencies that have the ratio 3:2 as perfect fifths. And sadly, I had to break it to the girls that these two facts mean that no piano is in tune. In other words, you can tuna fish, but you can't tune a piano.

When we tune an instrument, we would like for all our octaves and fifths to be perfect. One way to tune an instrument would be to start with a pitch and start working out the fifths above and below it it. We start with some frequency that we call C. Then 3/2 times that frequency is G, 9/4 times that frequency is D (an octave and a step above our original C), and so on. If you learned about the “circle of fifths” at some point in your musical life, then you know that if we keep going up by fifths, we’ll eventually land back on something we'd like to call C. It takes a total of 12 steps, and so if we keep all our fifths perfect, the frequency of the C we get at the end is 312/212, or 531441/4096, times the frequency of the C we had at the beginning. You might notice that 531441/4096 is not an integer, much less a power of 2, so our ears would not perceive the C at the end as being in tune with the C at the beginning. (531441/4096 is about 130, which is 2 more than a power of 2, so we would hear the C at the top as being sharp.) And it's not a problem with the assumption that it takes 12 fifths to get from C to shining C. We can never get perfect octaves from a stack of fifths because no power of 3/2 will ever give us a power of 2.

Imperfect octaves are

Conan O’Brien, evidently aware of such concerns, this week came up with an amusing spoof ad (above) that draws its inspiration from those classic Apple commercials broadcast around 10 years ago. O’Brien clearly believes the AirPods are set to become a real money-spinner for the Cupertino company – so long as people keep losing them.

Questioned on the burning issue during an appearance on Good Morning America this week, Apple CEO Tim Cook insisted that up to now, when trying out the AirPods, they’ve not once dropped out.

“I’ve been on treadmills, walking, doing all the things you normally do … and I have never personally had one fall out” Cook said, adding that “snipping the wires” actually makes them more secure than wired alternatives as they don’t get caught on things or slip out through their own weight.

The iPhone 7 launches today, but we won’t find out how secure the AirPods are till the end of next month, which is when they go on sale.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Problem 1.1: Above, we saw that \(n^2\), a quadratic, had a linear sequence as its finite differences. Prove this for the general quadratic.

If the sequence is \(A n^2 + B n + C\), the finite differences are of the form \(A[(n+1)^2 - n^2] + B[(n+1) - n] + C[1 - 1] = (2A)n + (A + B)\), which is linear

Problem 1.2: What would be the corresponding theorem for cubics? Prove it.

We know that the cubic is of the form \(A n^3 + q(n)\), where \(q(n)\) is quadratic. Our finite differences are \(A [(n+1)^3 - n^{3}] + [q(n+1) - q(n)]\). The finite differences of the second term are linear and of the first are quadratic, so the overall differences are quadratic.

Problem 1.3: Extend the above to general $n$-th order polynomials.

Induct. When you expand \((n+1)^k - n^k\), we get a polynomial of degree \(k-1\); induct downward on \(k\).

Problem 2.1: The "Tribonacci" sequence is defined by \(T_{n+3} = T_{n+2} + T_{n+1} + T_n\) and starting values \(T_1 = T_2 = T_3 = 1\). What is the smallest \(n\) for which \(T_n\) is over 9000? Over \(10^{10}\)? A calculator might be helpful, but don't just brute force the answer.

I warn you, this problem is somewhat hard. Let's begin. We first find the characteristic polynomial, \(P(\lambda) = \lambda^3 - \lambda^2 - \lambda - 1\). Now we need to find roots, but this polynomial does not factor in any nice way. What you can do, however, is estimate. \(P(1) = 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 = -2\), and \(P(2) = 8 - 4 - 2 - 1 = 1\), so we know that our answer is close to 2. We can check \(1.8\) or so, and we

There was a time when manual transmissions were synonymous with performance cars, but that time is past.

Ferrari is the latest automaker to retire the clutch pedal, a move that will probably seem like a gut punch to fans of stick shifts, but isn’t too surprising given the low sales of manuals in Ferraris and other high-end performance cars over the past few years. And that’s not even the primary reason why Ferrari is ditching manuals.

“Ferrari is design, performance, and state-of-the-art technologies. There’s no manual transmission that can beat this performance and therefore we have decided to stay on the double-clutch gearbox,” Michael Hugo Leiters, the automaker’s chief technology officer, said in an interview with Motor Authority at the recent 2016 Paris Motor Show. Even a well-shifted manual can’t match the speed of modern dual-clutch transmissions, after all.

That argument is a compelling one for manufacturers constantly looking to increase the performance of their cars, both to win over consumers and to achieve bragging rights. For decades, manual transmissions had a performance advantage over those without clutch pedals, but today’s dual-clutch transmissions have erased that advantage. They shift faster, and they help carmakers snag customers that might have been discouraged by having to master a manual.

Ferrari isn’t alone in leaving the manual transmission behind. Lamborghini and McLaren don’t have a single manual between them, and Porsche has made the dual-clutch PDK transmission mandatory on the highest-performance versions of its 911. Porsche still offers manuals on lower-level models, though, and Aston Martin still offers them throughout its range.

Manuals are also much easier to find on less-expensive cars. Once you leave the six-figure realm, they start to become more common on performance cars. The manual transmission is definitely on the endangered species list, but it’s not extinct … yet.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Remove the nozzle from the pump and insert it into the fuel filler opening. Pull the handle inside the nozzle upward to release the gas into your tank. The nozzle may have a trigger-lock feature that holds the handle in place while fueling to prevent having to stand and hold it. Once the tank is full, the gas pump will shut off with a click and gas will stop flowing. If you do not intend to completely fill your tank, you will have to watch the pump to see when you have reached the desired dollar amount of gasoline and then release the handle, or stop the automatic flow by pulling up on the handle to release it. Replace the nozzle back on the pump, reattach your fuel filler cap, shut the fuel filler door and you’re on the road

What's in a name? For the Greek god of the sun, Helios.

Say what? Helium is pronounced as HEE-lee-em.

History and Uses:

Helium, the second most abundant element in the universe, was discovered on the sun before it was found on the earth. Pierre-Jules-César Janssen, a French astronomer, noticed a yellow line in the sun's spectrum while studying a total solar eclipse in 1868. Sir Norman Lockyer, an English astronomer, realized that this line, with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometers, could not be produced by any element known at the time. It was hypothesized that a new element on the sun was responsible for this mysterious yellow emission. This unknown element was named helium by Lockyer.

The hunt to find helium on earth ended in 1895. Sir William Ramsay, a Scottish chemist, conducted an experiment with a mineral containing uranium called clevite. He exposed the clevite to mineral acids and collected the gases that were produced. He then sent a sample of these gases to two scientists, Lockyer and Sir William Crookes, who were able to identify the helium within it. Two Swedish chemists, Nils Langlet and Per Theodor Cleve, independently found helium in clevite at about the same time as Ramsay.

Helium makes up about 0.0005% of the earth's atmosphere. This trace amount of helium is not gravitationally bound to the earth and is constantly lost to space. The earth's atmospheric helium is replaced by the decay of radioactive elements in the earth's crust. Alpha decay, one type of radioactive decay, produces particles called alpha particles. An alpha particle can become a helium atom once it captures two electrons from its surroundings. This newly formed helium can eventually work its way to the atmosphere through cracks in the crust.

Helium is commercially recovered from natural

<|begin_of_text|>Games Workshop pricing in both Australia and New Zealnd have been a tough topic for a long time now. I am personally not down there, but feel for the pain they feel. I am also not an expert on why or how these prices end up the way they do, so when Alistar of War Incorporated wanted to do a breakdown of pricing in Australia and New Zealand, I said go for it. So here is Alistair's take and analysis on the subject.

Alistair, War Incorporated, NZ

The Antipodean Tax

Games Workshop customers in Australia and New Zealand have been suffering a huge price difference for Games Workshop products when compared to their UK and US counterparts. It’s really hurting the Games Workshop hobby over here, and there has been no explanation for it from Games Workshop headquarters.

The current pricing structure seems to have been set back in around 2006, sadly at that time the AUS and particularly NZ dollar was at its weakest trading levels in recent history, it was almost NZ$3 against the British pound. This is where the price point for recent releases remain, despite 5 years of a steadily strong NZ$ and AUS$, compared to the British Pound. Current exchange levels are around NZ$2.3 against the British pound, and look set to stay that way for some time.

But words aside, the numbers alone really do all the talking. The table below shows an international price comparison of recent releases from Games Workshop. What jumps out straight away is that the US and UK prices are almost the same, and certainly within a range that nobody would quibble about, the NZ prices however are in some instances cost is creeping towards an additional 50%;

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, among those paid by the hour, 1.6 million Americans earned the prevailing federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour in 2012. (The data for 2013 hasn’t been released yet.) Of these, 484,000 are aged 16 to 19.

So... the Democrats’ big idea on income inequality is one that will increase wages for... 1.1 percent of the workforce.

The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, although many states and localities require a higher wage by law. SeaTac, the municipality that surrounds Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, now requires $15 per hour. Democrats want to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour, an additional $2.85 per hour.

For a minimum-wage employee working 40 hours per week, that’s an additional $114 per week, before taxes.

For a 30-hour-per-week worker, we’re talking about an additional $85.50 per week.

With 1.6 million earning the federal minimum wage, averaging 35 hours per week, this would amount to $159.6 million in higher wages per week. That, times 52 weeks per year, amounts to about $8.2 billion. That may sound like a lot, but we have a $17 trillion economy.

In short, an America with a $10.10-per-hour minimum wage would look indistinguishable from the one we see today on the issue of income inequality, as well as the economic aspect that more conservatives focus on, opportunity for advancement. (Getting that first entry-level, minimum wage may get harder as each employee becomes more expensive to the employer.) The workers making minimum wage may very well appreciate the extra $85 to $114 per week, but it’s not going to have much of an impact on their purchasing power. Small companies on tight margins may find the $2.85-per-worker-per-hour cost more difficult to handle, or may raise prices. Of course, if prices go up... that will eat into the budgets of those minimum-wage workers pretty fast, won’t it?<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Cost segregation services benefit commercial property owners in many ways. How you ask? Well, let’s look at a brief list:

1) Cost segregation accelerates depreciation

2) Cost segregation reduces income tax burden

3) Cost segregation increases cash flow

4) Cost segregation reduces real estate taxes

5) Cost segregation reduces property insurance premiums

6) Cost segregation places the commercial property owner in IRS tax compliance

Cost segregation delivers results for any commercial property owner. Some industries, however, cost segregation works exceptionally well for. Here are some examples:

1) Dentists & Orthodontists

2) Physicians & Medical Groups

3) Multi-family, apartments, condos

4) Light manufacturing

5) Heavy manufacturing

6) Self storage facilities

7) Restaurants

8) Retail

9) Office buildings, and many more

Industries such as dental, medical and manufacturing have many specialized systems qualifying for accelerated depreciation. These include dedicated plumbing & electrical systems, dedicated lighting, specialized HVAC & air handling equipment, just to name a few. Cost segregation identifies these systems and “segregates” them out as 5-year assets. In many instances these systems can run several tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. Imagine what it would do for your cash flow to reclassify those assets to 5-year. Let’s say you had $100,000 in dedicated systems being depreciated over 39 years….thats’s $2564 in depreciation per year. With cost segregation applied, now that $100,000 is depreciated over 5 years…that’s an average of $20,000 per year for this example. Actually, when the depreciation is accelerated into 5 years it becomes what is called MACRS or Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System. This classification applies depreciation differently from the “Straight Line” method…it is called a 200% Declining Balance.

So what does this mean ultimately? It means you now have more of your money today to use as you see fit. Cost segregation pulls tomorrow’s dollars out of your building and gives it to you today. Ask your CPA about the time-value of money. Your CPA or tax advisor will confirm your money is always worth more today than tomorrow!

Cost segregation isn’t magic, smoke and mirrors. Cost segregation is a legitimate tax strategy allowing any commercial property owner to take more control of his or her finances. Cost segregation puts cash in your pocket.

Cost segregation delivers results every time it’s applied!

At $84,000 ($1,000 per pill), Gilead Sciences Inc.'s new hepatitis C drug is a pricey cure. It's also highly effective, producing 90% cure rates in trials and a reduction in side effects and other complications. Some argue it's the most important drug approved this year, offering hope to many afflicted with the viral disease.

But the price of the drug, Sovaldi, is a threat to the efforts attempting to ease up on medical costs and relieve taxpayers. Senators Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) sent a letter to Gilead requesting an explanation for the drug's high cost.

"It is unclear how Gilead set the price for Sovaldi," the senators wrote in the letter, which was sent to the biopharmaceutical company on Friday, June 11. "That price appears to be higher than expected given the costs of development and production and the steep discounts offered in other countries."

Pharmasset originally developed the hepatitis C drug and intended to price the therapy at $36,000. In 2011, Gilead Sciences acquired Pharmasset for $11 billion. Before the buy, Phramasset was working on the drug with Bristol-Myers Squibb, a company that was developing a combination drug that some said worked better. Possibly in an attempt to launch the drug faster, Gilead dropped Bristol-Myers Squibb after it acquired Pharmasset.

Sovaldi could become one of the top-selling pharmaceutical therapies, as sales are projected to hit $8 billion this year. The senators argue that this will also increase Medicare and Medicaid costs.

Previously in March, House Democrats had also sent a letter to Gilead asking for an explanation of their intended price tag.

"This letter is a 'bank shot' that gets things going, with the goal of getting Gilead to significantly lower the price of Sovaldi," said Terry Haines, a political strategist. It was intended not only to put pressure on the company, but also to motivate other lawmakers to band together in the effort.

"Our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it," the letter said.

Hepatitis C, a contagious liver disease, can be fatal when left untreated. Approximately 3 million people suffer from the illness, and that number is expected to steadily rise. It spreads through contact with an infected person's blood. While the infection can be short-term, the chances of short-term

A lot greater. To have just a break-even chance of meeting that 1.5 degree goal we solemnly set in Paris, we’ll need to close all of the coal mines and some of the oil and gas fields we’re currently operating long before they’re exhausted.

“Absent some incredible breakthrough in mythical carbon-sucking unicorns, the numbers say we’re done with the expansion of the fossil fuel industry,” says Kretzmann. “Living up to the Paris Agreement means we must start a managed decline in the fossil fuel industry immediately—and manage that decline as quickly as possible.”

“Managed decline” means we don’t have to grind everything to a halt tomorrow; we can keep extracting fuel from existing oil wells and gas fields and coal mines. But we can’t go explore for new ones. We can’t even develop the ones we already know about, the ones right next to our current projects.

In the United States alone, the existing mines and oil wells and gas fields contain 86 billion tons of carbon emissions—enough to take us 25 percent of the way to a 1.5 degree rise in global temperature. But if the U.S. energy industry gets its way and develops all the oil wells and fracking sites that are currently planned, that would add another 51 billion tons in carbon emissions. And if we let that happen, America would single-handedly blow almost 40 percent of the world’s carbon budget.

This new math is bad news for lots of powerful players. The fossil fuel industry has based its entire business model on the idea that it can endlessly “replenish” the oil and gas it pumps each year; its teams of geologists are constantly searching for new fields to drill. In September, Apache Corporation announced that it has identified fields in West Texas that hold three billion barrels of oil. Leaving that oil underground—which the new math shows we must do if we want to meet the climate targets set in Paris—would cost the industry tens of billions of dollars.

For understandable reasons, the unions whose workers build pipelines and drill wells also resist attempts to change. Consider the current drama over the Dakota Access oil pipeline. In September, even after pipeline security guards armed with pepper spray and guard dogs attacked Native Americans who were nonviolently defending grave sites from bulldozers, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka called on the Obama administration to allow construction to proceed. “Pipeline construction and maintenance,” Trumka said, “provides quality jobs to tens of thousands of skilled workers

Client Fundación cidade da cultura de Galicia

Project Year 2011

Photographs Duccio Malagamba

Text description provided by the architects. The City of Culture is a new cultural center for the Province of Galicia in northwestern Spain. Its design evolves from the superposition of three sets of information. First, the street plan of the medieval center of Santiago is overlaid on a topographic map of the hillside site, which overlooks the city. Second, a modern Cartesian grid is laid over these medieval routes. Third, through computer modeling software, the topography of the hillside is allowed to distort the two flat geometries, thus generating a topological surface that repositions old and new in a simultaneous matrix never before seen.

The original center of Santiago conforms to a figure/ground urbanism in which buildings are figural, or solid, and the streets are residual, or void spaces. Through this mapping operation, the project emerges as a curving surface that is neither figure nor ground but both a figured ground and a figured figure that supersede the figure-ground urbanism of the old city. Santiago’s medieval past appears not as a form of representational nostalgia but as a new yet somehow familiar presence found in a new form.

The six buildings of the project are conceived as three pairs: the Museum of Galicia and the International Art Center; the Center for Music and Performing Arts and the Central Services building; and the Library of Galicia and the Galician Archives. Visitors’ experiences of any given building will be affected by its relationship to its immediate partner. The caminos, or pedestrian streets, between the buildings also open onto a public plaza, which is bordered by the six buildings and features landscape and water elements. The largest building is the Performing Arts Theater, which will stand 42.5 meters high. The heights of all of the buildings rise in gentle curves that seem to reconstruct the shape of the hilltop with their collective rooflines, which are all clad in stone and marked with the grids that inform the design of the site.

The Library of Galicia and Galician Archives opened their doors on January 11, 2011, during a ceremony presided over by the Prince and Princess of Asturias. The 17,372-square-meter Library will accommodate one million books in open stacks, rare book archives,

Dell has never been shy about offering Linux on its devices in order to make fans of the OS happy while shaving a few bucks off the full price. The savings come from users not needing to spend money on the Windows license. Two of the company’s latest models are getting the same treatment with Dell rolling out an XPS 13 and M3800 Developer Edition, both of which come with Ubuntu 14.04.1 installed.

The M3800 with Ubuntu is available now, and getting rid of Windows 8.1 carves a savings of $101.50 from the price tag. This means the starting price is $1533.50, which is certainly not cheap, but for users planning to replace Windows with Linux anyway, not being forced to spend extra for the OS is a solid deal.

One major complaint users had about Dell’s previous Ubuntu offering, the XPS 13 Developer Edition, was that they wanted a larger, more powerful model, and Dell is delivering here. The M3800’s 15.6 inch display features a UHD resolution of 3,840 × 2,160. That’s powered by a fourth generation Intel Core i7 quad-core processor, up to 16GB of RAM and NVIDIA Quadro K1100M graphics.

A minor issue users will have with the Ubuntu version is the fact 14.04.1 does not support the M3800’s Thunderbolt 2.o port. However, Dell is promising that with the upcoming Ubuntu 14.04.2 release, support for it will be added, so users will only have to deal with not having access to the port for a short period of time.

As for the XPS 13, Dell has not started selling the newest Linux-toting model as of this writing. In a Dell blog post, the company said that the fourth generation XPS 13 will be available soon, though it did not offer an exact release date for the updated version.

A key selling point of both models is their size, as the XPS 13 starts at a very light 2.6 pounds, and the larger M3800’s base weight is just 4.7 pounds. Those light specifications are maintained on the Ubuntu-based models. No word on how the switch impacts battery life, however.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Previously in British English (but not in American English), the word "billion" referred exclusively to a million millions (1,000,000,000,000). However, this is no longer common, and the word has been used to mean one thousand million (1,000,000,000) for several decades.[4]

The term milliard can also be used to refer to 1,000,000,000; whereas "milliard" is seldom used in English,[5] variations on this name often appear in other languages.

In the South Asian numbering system, it is known as 100 crore or 1 arab.

Since the end of the 2013-14 season in mid-April, Stevens has tortured himself with film study from his team's 25-win campaign and plucked the clips he thought would best demonstrate to his players just what needs to be done this season to take the next step in a rebuilding process that can't go fast enough for anyone involved.

After months of poring over game film, Brad Stevens is happy to be back at practice, saying, "This is the fun part of my job, this is what I've always enjoyed the most -- watching the team." AP Photo/Michael Dwyer

Stevens, with a white polo tucked into green basketball shorts, beamed as he stood at center court and watched his players get loose for Tuesday's second session. Twenty-four hours earlier, he had sat a podium in the same gymnasium and apologized to reporters for any rambling answers he was giving during the team's media day because he was so focused on the first team practice that loomed.

"I've had [the film cut up] for a while. I've been bored," Stevens deadpanned Tuesday before his team's afternoon session. "I told someone the other day -- they said, 'What are you doing?' And I said, 'Paralyzing myself by analysis right now.'"

Stevens first said he took a week after the season to breathe, then took it back by admitting he cheated and studied film at nights or while traveling during that span. Even if you give him full credit for taking seven days after Boston's season ended, he's still had a mind-numbing 161 days to comb through film for answers to his team's struggles.

That's 3,864 hours to dissect the team's 57 losses. That's 231,840 minutes to wonder how so many games slipped away in the final minute.

There had to have been something better on Netflix to watch.

"It was more about analyzing what didn't go right and figuring out what we could control to make that go better," said Stevens.

There's a renewed confidence in his voice, not that his ever wavered last season. Even from day one of his surprise hiring, Stevens met everything thrown at him head-on during his first NBA season and battled through

Thereport highlights how global risks are not only interconnected but also have systemic impacts. To manage global risks effectively and build resilience to their impacts, better efforts are needed to understand, measure and foresee the evolution of interdependencies between risks, supplementing traditional risk-management tools with new concepts designed for uncertain environments. If global risks are not effectively addressed, their social, economic and political fallouts could be far-reaching, as exemplified by the continuing impacts of the financial crisis of 2007-2008.

The systemic nature of our most significant risks calls for procedures and institutions that are globally coordinated yet locally flexible. As international systems of finance, supply chains, health, energy, the Internet and the environment become more complex and interdependent, their level of resilience determines whether they become bulwarks of global stability or amplifiers of cascading shocks. Strengthening resilience requires overcoming collective action challenges through international cooperation among business, government and civil society.

Box 1: Objectives of the Global Risks 2014 Report The world faces risks that can be addressed only by long-term thinking and collaboration among business, governments and civil society. The Global Risks 2014 report aims to support this process by: exploring the nature of systemic risks

mapping 31 global risks according to the level of concern they arouse, their likelihood and potential impact, as well as the strength of the interconnections between them

looking in-depth at the ways in which three constellations of global risk – centred on youth, cyberspace and geopolitics – could interplay and have systemic impact

Mapping Global Risks in 2014

Based on a survey of the World Economic Forum’s multistakeholder communities, the report maps 31 global risks according to level of concern, likelihood and impact and interconnections among them.

The risks of highest concern to respondents are fiscal crises in key economies, structurally high unemployment and underemployment, and water crises (Table 1).

Started camping here in 2010 and immediately fell in love with the place. SBISP is the best deal on PIB, hotels/houses are very expensive to book, so camping is a great alternative. I am unsure how the crowd is during the week at the SBISP, but during the weekends they are packed. Christmas in July is ALWAYS sold out, so if you plan to camp during that weekend you have to book 6 months in advance. (trust me) Price for camping is very reasonable, basically $65/ campsite, but when you factor in price per person it is around $10/person. Everyone that is staying there is there to party, quiet time is after 10pm. Alcohol, though it states you cannot drink, everyone does, just put it in a red solo cup, the rangers are extremely cool as long as you show them respect, and remember to clean up prior to leaving. SBISP has remained successful because people respect the rules, by doing this, authority figures allow some of the rules to be bent, i.e. drinking. They say 6 people per campsite, and I believe 2 or 3 tents per site, honestly, I have never had a problem, I've rented two sites next to each other with almost 20 people total staying there along with 8 tents set up, again, respect the rules and they look the other way on small things. Bathrooms are alright, remind me of a typical park bathroom, this isn't the Ritz Carlton, but they do have outlets in the bathrooms. Showers have hardly any pressure, but are manageable. They now allow two cars per pad, (extra fee for second car) Campfire wood is few and far between, (you cannot bring wood over from the mainland), you can however purchase some. Only one cab company runs inside SBISP, others pickup/drop-off at the entrance into the grounds. One of the cool things (safety) is that late night dropoffs (1am+), you are greeted by an officer checking to see who you are and where exactly you are staying in SBISP. He is extremely friendly and is just doing his job to keep any unwelcome guest from disturbing the campers, show him some respect. In summary; SBISP is a great cheap alternative that still boast all the same amenities that any other part of the island would offer. I would not think twice

Fish, reptiles, and even some invertebrates appear to play. But when is it play, and not something else? And why do animals do it?

During a visit to the National Zoo in Washington, DC, biopsychologist Gordon Burghardt decided to peek in on a Nile soft-shelled turtle its keepers affectionately called “Pigface.” Pigface had been a zoo resident for more than 50 years, and Burghardt had seen him before, but this time, he noticed something a bit curious—Pigface was playing basketball.

“It was by itself,” recalls Burghardt, currently at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, and “it had started to knock around” a basketball provided by its keepers. The year was 1994, and play had only rarely and anecdotally been reported in animals other than mammals, but he thought that might be what Pigface was doing. The 1-meter-long turtle exuberantly pushed the ball around its aquatic enclosure, swimming through the water with ease as it batted the ball in front of it with its nose. “If you saw a dog or an otter going around batting a ball, bouncing around and chasing it, and going back and forth and doing it over and over again, we’d have no problem calling it play,” he says. “And that’s what the turtle was doing.”

More recently, ethologist Jennifer Mather of the University of Lethbridge in Canada learned that two of her octopus research subjects had repeatedly blown jet streams of water at floating empty pill bottles, shooting them across the surface of their tanks at the Seattle Aquarium. “If you give an [octopus] something new, it will grab it in its arms and bring it up to its mouth, probably exploring it chemically,” she says. This would usually happen a couple of times, she adds, until it “knew what it was, and didn’t bother anymore. But these two, it’s like they suddenly thought, ‘Maybe I can do something with this.’ ”

For Burghardt and Mather and most researchers who have witnessed such bizarre activities in reptiles, fish, and even invertebrates, it is clear that these animals engage in some form of play. But not everyone is convinced. “I personally doubt it,” says behavioral physiologist Bernd Heinrich of the University of Vermont. “I personally have never seen anything I’d call ‘play’ in turtles and was

<|begin_of_text|>Embedded processors can be relied upon to be a little quirky. Lately I’ve been playing around with the Raspberry Pi’s BCM2835 processor, which is based on the ARM1176JZF-S core. The “J” stands for Jazelle, a module that permits this processor to execute Java bytecodes directly. As far as I know there’s no open source support for using this, and my guess is that a JIT compiler will perform much better anyway, except perhaps in very RAM-limited systems. The “Z” indicates that this core supports TrustZone, which provides a secure mode switch so that secrets can be kept even from privileged operating system code. The “F” means the core has a floating point unit. Finally, “S” indicates a synthesizable core: one for which ARM licenses the Verilog or VHDL.

One thing I always like to know is how an embedded processor and its compiler cooperate to get things done; looking at the compiler’s output for some simple math functions is a good way to get started. I have a file of operations of the form:

long x00 (long x) { return x* 0; } long x01 (long x) { return x* 1; } long x02 (long x) { return x* 2; } long x03 (long x) { return x* 3; }...

Of course, multiplying by zero, one, and two are boring, but there’s a cute way to multiply by three:

x03: add r0, r0, r0, asl #1 bx lr

The computation here is r0 + (r0<<1), but instead of separate shift and add instructions, both operations can be done in a single instruction: ARM supports pre-shifting one operand “for free” as part of ALU operations. I had always considered this to be sort of a bizarre fallout from ARM’s decision to use fixed-size instruction words (gotta use all 32 bits somehow…) so it’s pretty cool to see the compiler putting the shifter to good use. Presumably GCC has a peephole pass that runs over the RTL looking for pairs of operations that can be coalesced.

Multiplying by four is just (r0<<2) and multiplying by five is r0 + (r0<<2). Multiply-by-six is the first operation that requires more than one ALU instruction and multiply-by-11 is the first one that requires an additional register. GCC (version

<|begin_of_text|>Amid all the bad news coming out of the NFL lately, one story that emerged from the league is about as uplifting as it gets — even if casual sports fans probably missed it altogether.

This is the story of Devon Still, the Cincinnati Bengals and a powerful statement in support of anyone affected by pediatric cancer.

Still is a 25-year-old defensive tackle who was an All-American at Penn State University. The Bengals picked him in the second round of the 2012 NFL Draft, but he hasn't been too great on the field since then, registering just 28 tackles, half a sack and no starts in two seasons with the team.

The Bengals cut Still in late August, just before the start of the 2014 season. Injuries had dulled his athleticism, according to ESPN, but there was something else weighing him down too: A four-year-old daughter named Leah battling Stage 4 cancer. She's reportedly been given a 50-50 chance of survival.

So there's Still, in late August, left unemployed by the only NFL team he's ever played for and with a daughter at home who's as likely to die as she is to live. But the Bengals did Still a solid even while cutting him loose; coach Marvin Lewis gave him a spot on the practice squad so he could continue drawing a paycheck to pay for Leah's cancer treatments.

NFL practice squad players are paid a minimum of $6,300 per week that they stay among the group of 10 players that practices with a team but does not suit up for games. Stay on for a full 17 weeks and you make about $107,000. That's not bad money — but it's nothing compared to the $570,000 minimum salary for NFL players, such as Still, with two years of playing experience, according the site Spotrac, which analyzes sports salaries.

Still said at the time that he was grateful for the opportunity, given the more pressing concerns in his life.

"I completely understand where they were coming from," he said last week. "I can't give football 100% right now. In the business aspect they want guys to solely focus on football, which is understandable. We are here to win this city a Super Bowl and right now I am not in a position where I can give football 100% of everything I have."

But then the Bengals did something even more awesome: They moved Still up to the 53-man active roster this week.

And the story gets even better — much better. The Bengals announced late Monday

<|begin_of_text|>Mass and Weight are two often misused and misunderstood terms in mechanics and fluid mechanics.

The fundamental relation between mass and weight is defined by Newton's Second Law. Newton's Second Law can be expressed as

F = m a (1) where F = force (N, lb f ) m = mass (kg, slugs) a = acceleration (m/s2, ft/s2)

Mass

Mass is a measure of the amount of material in an object, being directly related to the number and type of atoms present in the object. Mass does not change with a body's position, movement or alteration of its shape, unless material is added or removed.

an object with mass 1 kg on earth would have the same mass of 1 kg on the moon

Mass is a fundamental property of an object, a numerical measure of its inertia and a fundamental measure of the amount of matter in the object.

Weight

Weight is the gravitational force acting on a body mass. The generic expression of Newton's Second Law (1) can be transformed to express weight as a force by replacing the acceleration - a - with the acceleration of gravity - g - as

F g = m a g (2) where F g = gravitational force - or weight (N, lb f ) m = mass (kg, slugs) a g = acceleration of gravity on earth (9.81 m/s2, 32.17405 ft/s2)

Example - The Weight of a Body on Earth vs. Moon

The acceleration of gravity on the moon is approximately 1/6 of the acceleration of gravity on the earth. The weight of a body with mass 1 kg on the earth can be calculated as

F g_ earth = (1 kg) (9.81 m/s2)

= 9.81 N

The weight of the same body on the moon can be calculated as

F g_ moon = (1 kg) ((9.81 m/s2) / 6)

= 1.64 N

The handling of mass and weight depends on the systems of units used. The most common unit systems are

the International System - SI

the British Gravitational System - BG

the English Engineering System - EE

One newton is

≈ the weight of one hundred grams - 101.972 gf (g F ) or 0.101972 kgf (kg F or kilopond - kp (pondus is latin for weight))

These differences seem small, but for the person running the campaign they can provide a moment of panic. If I see the higher percentage first then see the lower percentage, I wonder if people cancelled or adjusted their pledge. This is especially troubling when you get close to the end of a campaign because there are bad actors out there you like to give you that last little bit then dispute the charge later (and Kickstarter then charges my credit card to pay them back). And, there are plenty of Kickstarter spammers who back your project hoping you’ll back theirs, then cancel their pledge when you don’t. I know, weird.

Your pledge is just that. No money changes hands until the pledge total goes over the minimum funding. I haven’t captured any of that money, and I only expect to get about 90% of it through various credit card issues once Kickstarter collects in about two weeks.

But, back to programming. When you see two different ways of getting the same number, you know you have a code smell. We know that there should be a common routine that handles it. It seems simple to divide two numbers, but obviously it isn’t. There are other things, like normalization, that come into play.

Let’s divide some numbers in Perl 6. First, there’s the division operator and it might look like it divides two numbers. If I look at the type of thingy in $n, I see that it’s a Rat (rational number). If I look at the.

Whether it was your favorite toy or the last portion of mashed potatoes, anyone who grew up with a sibling knows that you learn to forcefully stake your claim to what’s rightfully yours.

It turns out that a similar idea can be applied to robots.

In a new piece of research — presented at the recent 2017 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) — engineers from Google and Carnegie Mellon University demonstrated that robots learn to grasp objects more robustly if another robot can be made to try and snatch it away from them while they’re doing so.

When one robot is given the task of picking up an object, the researchers made its evil twin (not that they used those words exactly) attempt to grab it from them. If the object isn’t properly held, the rival robot would be successful in its snatch-and-grab effort. Over time, the first robot learns to more securely hold onto its object — and with a vastly accelerated learning time, compared to working this out on its own.

“Robustness is a challenging problem for robotics,” Lerrel Pinto, a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute told Digital Trends. “You ideally want a robot to be able to transfer what it has learnt to environments that it hasn’t seen before, or even be stable to risks in the environment. Our adversarial formulation allows the robot to learn to adapt to adversaries, and this could allow the robot to work in new environments.”

The work uses deep learning technology, as well as insights from game theory: the mathematical study of conflict and cooperation, in which one party’s gain can mean the other party’s loss. In this case, a successful grab from the rival robot is recorded as a failure for the robot it grabbed the object from — which triggers a learning experience for the loser. Over time, the robots’ tussles make each of them smarter.

That sounds like progress — just as long as the robots don’t eventually form a truce and target us with their adversarial AI, we guess!<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

The 22nd Amendment to the United States Constitution sets term limits for the elected President of the United States. Passed by the United States Congress on March 21, 1947, the 22nd Amendment was later ratified by the requisite number of states on the 27th of February in 1951.

The 22nd Amendment states that no personal shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice and no person who has already held office—or acted as the president of the United States—for more than two years of a term shall be elected President more than once.

The primary motive of this amendment was to establish term limits; the 22nd Amendment to the United States Constitution states that no US President shall be elected to more than two terms. Furthermore, the 22nd Amendment limits the maximum time an individual may be serve as President to 10 years, if the person should succeed to the office.

Original Text of the 22nd Amendment to the United States Constitution:

Section 1. No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once. But this article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this article was proposed by the Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term.

Section 2. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its submission to the States by the Congress.

History of the 22nd Amendment:

Historians cite George Washington’s unwillingness to seek office for a third term as evidence that the founding fathers saw the two-term limit as conventional. The constraint was instituted to impede the development of pseudo monarchy.

In addition to Washington, Thomas Jefferson also contributed to the two-term limit by suggesting an office without restraints could yield a “a President for life”, which would obfuscate the premise of a democratic government.

<|begin_of_text|>Hi there folks. It’s been a long time since I last published a post. I have been busy. However in this post I am going to share some really informative tips and tricks which you might not have known about. So without wasting any time lets get straight to them:

Enumerate

Instead of doing:

i = 0 for item in iterable: print i, item i += 1

We can do:

for i, item in enumerate(iterable): print i, item

Enumerate can also take a second argument. Here is an example:

>>> list(enumerate('abc')) [(0, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (2, 'c')] >>> list(enumerate('abc', 1)) [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]

Dict/Set comprehensions

You might know about list comprehensions but you might not be aware of dict/set comprehensions. They are simple to use and just as effective. Here is an example:

my_dict = {i: i * i for i in xrange(100)} my_set = {i * 15 for i in xrange(100)} # There is only a difference of ':' in both

Forcing float division:

If we divide whole numbers Python gives us the result as a whole number even if the result was a float. In order to circumvent this issue we have to do something like this:

result = 1.0/2

But there is another way to solve this problem which even I wasn’t aware of. You can do:

from __future__ import division result = 1/2 # print(result) # 0.5

Voila! Now you don’t need to append.0 in order to get an accurate answer. Do note that this trick is for Python 2 only. In Python 3 there is no need to do the import as it handles this case by default.

Simple Server

Do you want to quickly and easily share files from a directory? You can simply do:

# Python2 python -m SimpleHTTPServer # Python 3 python3 -m http.server

This would start up a server.

Evaluating Python expressions

We all know about eval but do we all know about literal_eval? Perhaps not. You can do:

import ast my_list = ast.literal_eval(expr)

Instead of:

expr = "[1, 2, 3]" my_list = eval(expr)

I am sure that it’s something new for most of us

You can’t be what you can’t see, and I see a lack of women leaders in my industry.

Despite good intentions from most people, unconscious bias and structural inequality still leads us to a world where women and minorities are extremely underrepresented in Silicon Valley. We can do better.

After being in this industry for almost a decade, I’ve learned that given the existing inequalities, the only way to make real change is to go out of your way to do so. It’s important to acknowledge that there is already bias in your criteria, whether for hiring, promoting, or investing. So you must go out of your way to champion women and underrepresented minorities.

I don’t tweet about it a lot, but I’m an active angel investor. In the last three years, I’ve made nine investments, and three of them were in companies with women CEOs. 33% doesn’t feel good enough, though sadly this is likely higher than the ratio for most venture firms and angels. So I’ve decided to take it one step further.

I’m committing that the next nine angel investments I make will only be in companies run by women CEOs, without exception.

Recently, I’ve become a Sequoia Scout, so some of my investments will involve Sequoia’s capital. But my promise to only invest in women stands whether or not the funds are from my personal capital or Sequoia’s.

When learning A-level maths, much time is devoted to learning how to differentiate and integrate. For this week’s blog post, I have collected some puzzles based on these skills. They should be fun to solve, present a few surprises and maybe even provide a teacher or two with an extra challenge for capable students.

The answers to these puzzles will appear here from Sunday at 8am.

Let’s start with an integral:

An Integral Source: mscroggs.co.uk

What is

$$\int_0^{\frac\pi2}\frac1{1+\tan^ax}\,dx?$$

This might look difficult to you. You might first start by substituting in some specific values for $a$, and this would be a good way to start, but solving the integral in general is difficult. However, considering the second integral $$\int_0^{\frac\pi2}\frac1{1+\cot^ax}\,dx$$ along with the integral in the question should help.

Before I say too much, I’m going to stop and leave any further discussion of this puzzle for the answers [available from Sunday 8am].

Next, let’s have a go at a few derivatives:

$x$ to the power of $x$ to the power of $x$ to the power of … Source: mscroggs.co.uk

Let $\displaystyle y=x^{x^{x^{x^{.^{.^.}}}}}$ (with an infinite chain of powers of $x$).What is $\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}$?

Formula and value [ edit ]

Planck acceleration may be stated as

a P = c t P = 299792458 m / s 5.39116 × 10 − 44 s {\displaystyle a_{\text{P}}={\frac {c}{t_{\text{P}}}}={\frac {299792458\ m/s}{5.39116\times 10^{-44}\ s}}}

≈ 5.560815 × 10 51 m / s 2 {\displaystyle \approx 5.560815\times 10^{51}\ m/s^{2}}

≈ 5.670453 × 10 50 g {\displaystyle \approx 5.670453\times 10^{50}\ g}

where a P is the Planck acceleration, c is the speed of light, t P is the Planck time[1] and g is the standard acceleration of gravity.[2]

Meaning [ edit ]

The Planck acceleration is the highest acceleration conceivable in the Universe, as the speed of light is the highest possible speed and the Planck time is the shortest possible duration of any meaningful physical process. This limitation does assume that relativity has natural units. However, it is not clear whether any object in the Universe actually reaches or can reach the Planck acceleration. One event where the Planck acceleration was possibly reached was the Big Bang, in regard to the acceleration of the expanding Universe during the Planck epoch. Also, within a black hole, such acceleration might be possible beyond its horizon, but that is certainly unknown (and what lies beyond a horizon is beyond the reach of physical observation).

In a classical description, photons emanating from their subluminal source (for example, a particle-antiparticle collision) experience zero acceleration, as they always travel at the speed of light. However, since the Planck time is the least conceivable delay, the "instantaneous" production of a photon pair can not be distinguished from the acceleration of a photon from zero to the speed of light in a Planck time, thereby achieving a Planck acceleration. In other words, nothing higher than the Planck acceleration can be measured, since that would imply measuring a time interval shorter than the Planck time.

As with other quantities at the Planck scale, the physics of

Below is a list of each of the accepted disk drive space values. It is important to realize that not all manufacturers and developers list their value using binary, which is base 2. For example, a manufacturer may list a product's capacity as one gigabyte (1,000,000,000 bytes, a metric value) and not 1,073,741,824 bytes (gibibyte) that it actually is. For this page, we are using the "common names" and listing all values in base 2.

Note: All values are listed as whole numbers, which means a GB shows it can only contain one 650 MB CD. Technically, 1 GB could hold 1.5753 CDs worth of data, but this document isn't meant to show you how many "parts" of an object a value can hold. Therefore, we are omitting decimal values. More plainly, you can only fit one complete 650 MB CD on a 1 GB drive since two full 650 MB discs exceed 1 GB.

Tip: Except for a bit and a nibble, all values explained below are in bytes and not bits. For example, a kilobyte (KB) is different than a kilobit (Kb). When referring to storage, bytes are used whereas data transmission speeds are measured in bits.

Bit

A bit is a value of either a 1 or 0 (on or off).

Nibble

A nibble is 4 bits.

Byte

Today, a byte is 8 bits.

1 character, e.g., "a", is one byte.

Kilobyte (KB)

A kilobyte is 1,024 bytes.

Fresh grime styles.

On the cover for his new album, Safe, Louis Carnell looks like he's just awoken from a cryogenic freeze. It's an appropriate image. His tracks as Visionist sound as if they were made in an icy cave. Carnell uses wordless vocal samples and glassy synths to create an ethereal, almost choral take on grime. The South Londoner has been honing his style for the last few years, releasing on respected, boundary-pushing labels like Lit City Trax, Diskotopia, Leisure System and Left Blank. He's been a key name in the recent wave of creativity that's swept instrumental grime, but instead of focusing on rhythmic innovation or experimental sonics like many of his peers, Carnell's channelled emotions. On the two-part I'm Fine series he explored the five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. "The sharply honed dance music motifs that swim in the vast space seem untethered from any club context, instead pointing in on themselves," said Maya Kalev in her review of Part II. Similarly, Safe, which is released this week through PAN, sees Carnell confronting his struggles with anxiety. "I needed to make it a challenging listen to reflect this," he says below. The album's 15 tracks push Carnell's template further than ever before—the beats are tougher, the vocals more dense, the atmospheres chillier.

Along with his own work, Carnell is doing plenty to keep grime and its offshoots moving forward. His Lost Codes label gave early releases to trailblazers like Filter Dread, Sd Laika, Bloom and Acre, and the imprint was recently reborn as CODES, with PAN's Bill Kouligas coming on board. On RA.488 Carnell showcases plenty of artists in this ilk alongside cuts from Safe, resulting in a 42-minute, 27-track sonic blast.

What have you been up to recently?

Since the album finished, I have been working hard on my upcoming live shows. The first one is premiering at Unsound festival next week. Also keeping it busy with a lot of upcoming releases and new artists we're working with for our new label CODES, which I co-run with Bill from PAN.

How and where was the mix recorded?

It was recorded live straight in Logic, on CDJs and Serato in my flatmate's room.

Can you tell us about the idea behind the mix?

As recent graduate Pieter Smakman explained in a guest post in Sparkisan, “body parts are still very hard to scan due to their agile nature.” Whereas static objects are relatively straightforward and simple, a human limb has many nuances that make them considerably more difficult to fully process and understand (from a machine’s point of view, that is). So to address this issue, Smakman “developed the first dedicated and low-cost 3D Hand Scanner.”

With Raspberry Pis, laser pointers, and a total of 32 cameras, Smakman claims that his scanner “is able to create a precise surface model of the hand,” which in turn “opens a new world of possibilities: think of 3D printed braces, personalized medical instruments, and a long-awaited tool for everyone who designs products that interact with the human hand.”

For now, this world is one that only exists in hypotheticals — Smakman’s design is one of a kind and has yet to be reproduced, much less made available to the general public. But if it ever does come to fruition, it’s sure to have a major impact on the way our hands (and the rest of our bodies) are able to interact with the world.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>In my experience, the default libRblas gives horrible performance across all of the platforms that I regularly use (Windows, Mac OS & Linux). The R package that I’m currently developing uses RcppEigen, which is not dependent on an efficient BLAS or LAPACK library. However, many other R packages do have this dependency. Therefore, I would recommend following the instructions in the R Installation and Administration guide to switch over to a more efficient implementation. Avraham Adler, Tony Fischetti and Zachary Mayer have written similar blog posts on this topic. I use the Accelerate Umbrella Framework (vecLib) on OS X and Intel MKL with icc on Linux. The following instructions describe how (and why) to install GotoBLAS for R on Microsoft Windows.

As described in pp. 191-192 of “Seamless R and C++ Integration with Rcpp” (DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4614-6868-4), the lmBenchmark script can be used as a rough performance measurement for dense matrix algebra on any system. You need to install the packages RcppEigen and rbenchmark, then run:

Rscript -e "source(system.file(\"examples\", \"lmBenchmark.R\", package = \"RcppEigen\"))"

The output should look something like this (with default Rblas.dll):

As some of you reading this may or may not already know; over the past day or so I went from having the idea of creating a computer program that would essentially be able to play the popular arcade game Bejeweled Blitz on Facebook, to actually developing it. Now as hard as this problem sounds, it was surprisingly easy and fairly swift to solve. I broke it down in to 3 main steps: Identify the area in which the bejeweled game was being played. Identify what colour was in what square. Check for the possible directions you could move a colour to successfully make a line of 3. The first step was probably the most time consuming of them all as everything from there was just colour management. The Solution I came up with in the end for that was to take a screenshot of the entire screen, and then scan the image from top to bottom using a nested for loop until I found a funny shade of brown that only appears along the Top Edge of the bejeweled grid (for anyone wondering that colour is Color.FromArgb(255, 39, 19, 5)). Once this colour had been found using the bitmap.GetPixel(x, y) function, I broke out of both for loops and knew that was the point where the top left corner of the grid was. I could then use this to construct a rectangle which would extract the bejeweled grid from the full screenshot. The size of the rectangle was calculated using the size of the grid cells (40px², found that out using trusty old paint) multiplied by the amount of rows/columns there were (8, found that out using my eye balls). This resulted in the Rectangle size coming out at 320px².

Obtaining the playable grid.

So the next step from here was to identify what colour resides in what square. To do that I started off by creating a 2 dimensional array of colours (Or Color’s to be politically correct) that was 8 rows and 8 columns to match that of the playable grid. I then systematically looped through the 2 dimensional array of colours in a nested for of x and y values assigning the array the colour of the pixel at the Location (x * 40) + 20, (y * 40) + 22. The x value was decided as it

<|begin_of_text|>In the land of “broken windows” policing, it’s tinted windows that may land you in trouble.

The New York City Police Department issued 74,345 tickets for tinted windows in 2014, an average of 204 per day, according to a recent analysis by the Police Reform Organizing Project, an advocacy group that focuses on what it sees as excessive policing.

That number is higher than the number of stop-and-frisks, which totaled 47,345 over the same period.

State law dictates that car windows must allow at least 70 percent of sunlight through, measured by a “tint meter” that officers carry. The maximum penalty for a violation is $150 or 30 days in jail. Ignorance of the law is no excuse: buying a car with too-dark windows can still lead to a ticket.

“A driver needs unobstructed views of the roadway and other motorists,” said Stacy Wood, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Motor Vehicles.

We Are Witnesses A portrait of the U.S. immigration system in 12 short films

Critics see a law that disproportionately targets people of color and provides a pretext to churn revenue and fish for other violations or crimes. “It represents a form of heavy-handed and intrusive policing,” said Robert Gangi, founder of the Police Reform Organizing Project.

Broken windows policing, promoted by NYPD Commissioner William Bratton, theorizes that rooting out low-level, quality-of-life violations, such as graffiti, prevents more serious crime. “Bratton has said ‘broken windows’ policing is driven by 911 and 311 calls. But people don’t call the cops about tinted windows,” said Gangi.

NYPD spokesman Lt. John Grimpel said tinted windows can be dangerous to officers. “You can’t see into the car, so we would have no idea what’s going on inside when the windows are tinted,” he said, noting that people found guilty of having their windows too dark “aren’t going to get jail time.”

As of this June, there were 37,974 violations doled out for tinted windows in 2015.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Back in the Immutability section, we wrote a function in JavaScript that doubled the highest scores from regular season games in NBA history.

var multiplier = 2 ; var scores = [ 316, 320, 312, 370, 337, 318, 314 ]; function doubleScores ( scores ) { var newScores = []; for ( var i = 0 ; i < scores. length ; i ++ ) { newScores [ i ] = scores [ i ] * multiplier ; } return newScores ; }

When we gave it a list of numbers as an input, it produced an expected output.

> scores [ 316, 320, 312, 370, 337, 318, 314 ] > doubleScores ( scores ) [ 632, 640, 624, 740, 674, 636, 628 ]

What happens if we give it an input of a different type — one that’s not a list of numbers?

> var string = "scores" > doubleScores ( string ) [ NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN ]

> var undefinedValue = undefined > doubleScores ( undefinedValue ) Uncaught TypeError : Cannot read property 'length' of undefined at doubleScores ( experiment. js : 7 ) at < anonymous > : 1 : 1

> var object = { "key" : "value" } > doubleScores ( object ) []

It accepts the input no matter what its type is and gives us an unexpected output. When the input is a string, it generates an array of NaN (Not-a-number) values. JavaScript doesn’t have a data type called List. It only has an array, which is like an Elm list and Elm array combined.

When the input is an undefined value, the doubleScores function throws an error. Finally, when the input is an object, it returns an empty list. An object in JavaScript is similar to a record in Elm. It’s a collection of key value pairs.

We want our functions to be reliable. We want them to reject inputs that don’t belong to their input sets. Can we put up some guardrails around our functions so that they can reject invalid inputs? Let’s find out. Modify the doubleScores function in experiment.js located in the beginning-elm directory like this:

function doubleScores ( scores ) { // Reject non-list type inputs if ( Array. isArray ( scores ) === false ) { throw new Error ( "Input must be of type array" ); }

Description [ edit ]

The Infested Terran is a light, ground Zerg unit that is spawned by an Infestor using its Infested Terran spell. The Infestor throws an Infested Swarm Egg, which has 70 HP and takes three seconds to hatch. When it hatches, an Infested Terran emerges with health proportional to the percentage health of the egg, i.e. an egg that's at 50% health hatches an Infested Terran with only 50% health. The Infested Terran lasts for 21 seconds; it can attack up to 34 times during its duration, resulting in a maximum of 204 damage dealt (without armor or upgrades being taken into account).

Use [ edit ]

Infested Terrans are generally used in conjunction with Fungal Growth to pick off enemy drops, or deal extra damage to an army as an energy dump. Infested Terrans can be used as a form of worker harassment. As of Patch 16, Infested Terrans can be cast while the Infestor is burrowed and therefore hidden. Infestors in groups of 6 or more can tunnel into an enemy base and spawn multiple Infested Terrans to snipe key buildings like Robotics Bays or Command Centers.

Protoss units are fairly resistant to Infested Terran; however, they can be used to add anti-air damage for a Zerg player who opted not to go for Hydralisks. They are especially effective against Interceptors as well as Phoenixes.

Versus biomech builds, Infestors can cast Infested Terran on top of an infantry ball, and sieged Siege Tanks will splash their own units. Infested Terrans are also very useful to shoot down incoming or retreating Medivac dropships, commonly with the help of Fungal Growth to keep them in place.

At the core of this talk is the concept that every CPU cycle matters. This post is the first in a series exploring this idea as it pertains to data platform performance.

Every CPU Cycle Matters

Let’s start with a simple math exercise. In our equation we have CPU power on one end and a big dataset on the other.

In terms of CPU power, the fastest enterprise-grade hardware runs at 3.7 GHz. Currently there is no numerical definition for “Big Data”, but my peers and I concede that you have “Big Data” once you cross 100 billion records.

Now we’re ready to calculate how much time we can save if we eliminate 1 CPU cycle from each iteration. In these calculations I assume that we run on one core and eliminate one CPU cycle from the operation, which will touch each record in the dataset.

We calculate one CPU cycle operation at 1 / 3,700,000,000 of a sec and multiply it by 100 Billion records.

1 / 3,700,000,000 sec X 100,000,000,000 = 27 sec

That is an oustanding result! You can clearly see that one CPU cycle can represent tens of seconds of processing time. Think about the potential here! One tiny tweak, one CPU cycle saved, and a great reduction of processing times. Let’s see how this tweak effects the real world.

Removing CPU Cycles in the Real World

Different data types will force Vertica to use a different number of CPU cycles to process a data point. To illustrate the concept above, we’ll choose a data type for numeric values (as numeric values generally have a very high cardinality so the database engine will need to touch many different values to produce the final result).

The art of choosing data types

The fiscal irresponsibility is pervasive, appearing not only in the party’s national leadership, but also among state legislators. prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" / Oh, sure. Republicans have put up a good front recently, objecting strenuously to the flood of spending by Democratic lawmakers. Some of their horror is doubtless genuine. Spending during Obama/Pelosi/Reid’s (as yet short) reign has increased at unprecedented levels. The nation is facing record spending and deficits—and OPR have only just begun. But it is easy for Republicans to take a purely partisan stance against Democratic spending. If they want to regain the trust of voters, they must do more. They must demonstrate their ability (and willingness) to do better. They must not only reverse recent Democratic excesses, but they must also reverse their own recent excesses. Unfortunately, it does not seem that many in the current Republican leadership have the will to take such a stand. Consider the fact that Republican National Chairman Michael Steele has spent twice as much as his predecessors, as recently reported by Politico. It would be one thing if he were spending all that money on campaign ads and get-out-the-vote efforts. But he’s not. He’s paying for limousines, world-class caterers, private airplanes—even an annual RNC meeting in Hawaii. The exodus of Republican donors during his tenure emphasizes the recklessness of his spending—and the irresponsibility of anyone in Republican leadership who is not taking action against such lack of discipline. Why should voters trust leaders like Steele with federal tax dollars when these leaders are so thoughtless with private donations? But the problem does not stop with a few spendthrift national leaders. This fiscal irresponsibility extends even to conservative states like Texas. Naturally, the election year has prompted some Republican officials to make big, splashy, headline-grabbing displays of fiscal conservatism. Well, terrific, but these same officials also made many terrible, fiscally irresponsible decisions earlier, during non-election years. Voters are thus being asked to take a leap of faith: Trust that the conservative, election-year version of these officials remain. Hope that the big government, spendthrift version of these officials will not return after the election. In general, Texas has received much praise for being fiscally conservative, but let’s face it. Texas is being graded on a

Junkrat

TL;DR HP buff good, damage with Taste for Explosions is nerfed

If you’re curious about Junkrat as a whole, check out my previous article introducing him

Change 1

Stats

Base Maximum Health increased from 1273 to 1350

Health Regeneration increased from 2.7 to 2.8

Analysis

This 6% buff to Junkrat’s HP moves him from being equal to Valla to equal to Nova, moving him above Chromie and Raynor. As usual, the HP regen buff is simply to maintain that a hero regenerates 100% of their max HP every 480 seconds (8 minutes).

Change 2

Abilities

Frag Launcher (Q)

Damage increased from 117 to 128

Analysis

A much needed buff to Junkrat’s damage, this increases his primary damage output by 9.4%. This increases the damage for a full clip from 468 to 512.

Change 3

Talents

Level 4

Taste for Explosions (Q)

Damage decreased from.75 to.5 per hit, maximum damage decreased from 150 to 100

Bonzer Hits (W)

Bonus damage increased from 30 to 40%

Gotta Trap 'Em All (E)

Heroes hit requirement reduced from 8 to 7

Level 7

Sticky Wicket (E)

Slow duration increased from 3 to 3.5 seconds

Analysis

Taste for Explosions sees a net nerf, even accounting for the base Q damage buff. Even with only 100 stacks by level 20, the base damage buff is only 24.1 while Taste for Explosions sees a 25 damage nerf.

Bonzer Hits now adds 72 damage to Concussion Mine, up from 54. Given the difficulty of stacking this quest relative to Taste for Explosions, this is still much less added damage, but the damage does help keep it competitive when combined with the increase in push distance.

Gotta Trap ‘Em All is a powerful talent with a powerful reward, but features an extraordinarily difficult quest. Making

‘Awkward’ is a great word to describe the public relationship between President Donald Trump and his beautiful wife Melania. Over the last 8 months or so, the American people have been given a front row seat into a relationship which seems to be filled with strife. After all, what marriage wouldn’t have its issues when one of the two people involved were caught on camera saying they like to grab women by the ‘pussy’, right?

We have seen Melania make faces of disgust behind her husband’s back, refuse to hold his hand on numerous occasions, and only show affection when it seems like she almost has to. With all that said, yesterday’s antics at military facility Joint Base Andrews, may take the cake for the most awkward moment yet, since Trump’s presidency began nearly eight months ago.

Melania Trump was on hand to introduce her husband to the service men and women at the base in Maryland.

“It’s my great pleasure to introduce my husband, the President of the United States, Donald Trump,” stated Melania.

As she concluded her remarks, the President slowly stepped towards her, shook her hand and then appeared to almost push or guide her off stage. Such actions would appear to be normal, had the person introducing him been another male politician or statesman, however it almost appeared as if President Trump had forgotten that this was his wife he was dealing with. A kiss, or a long hug certainly would not have been out of the ordinary in this situation.

While rumors have surfaced that Melania had prepared to divorce the President prior to him unexpectedly winning the 2016 election, the event witnessed yesterday appears to show that there is a clear lack of affection within this marriage. Let’s hear your thoughts on yet another awkward moment between these two, in the comments section below.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Which state has the most forest land in the US, and which have made protecting evergreen wildlife a priority? Interestingly, there’s a pretty big gap between the two! The most forested state by far is Maine at 89% forest coverage, whereas the home to the largest national park in the US is Alaska. The Last Frontier is home to seven of the 10 largest US national park areas in size, with the largest being Wrangell-St. Elias. Which state has the most trees? It’s hard to say, since all trees have different sizes, but Maine is the most likely contender, with its relatively smaller pines. Its nickname is the Pine Tree State, after all, and its forest cover may relate to the fact that it’s the least densely populated state on the East Coast. While Maine is the state with the most trees, many others low on the list, like California, have made forest protection a priority. Check out our map to see more info besides which state has the largest area under forest.

Which state has the most national parks? What is the largest national park? If you find yourself asking these questions about the national parks in the United States, check out the map below! Surprisingly the majority of the largest parks are in Alaska. This is most likely due to the fact that it was one of the last territories to become a state and its low population. How many state parks and national parks have you visited?

India invented the Number System. Zero was invented by Aryabhatta. India never invaded any country in her last 10000 years of history. Sanskrit is the mother of all the European languages. Sanskrit is the most suitable language for computer software, according to a report in Forbes magazine, July 1987. The World's first university was established in Takshila in 700BC. More than 10,500 students from all over the world studied more than 60 subjects there. The University of Nalanda built in the 4th century BC was one of the greatest achievements of ancient India in the field of education. Ayurveda is the earliest school of medicine known to humans. Charaka, the father of medicine consolidated Ayurveda 2500 years ago. Today Ayurveda is fast regaining its rightful place in our civilization.India was the richest country on earth until the British invaded in the early 17th Century. Christopher Columbus was attracted by India's wealth. Bhaskaracharya calculated the time taken by the earth to orbit the sun hundreds of years before the astronomer Smart. Time taken by earth to orbit the sun in the 5th century - 365.258756484 days. The art of navigation was born in the river Sindh 6000 years ago. The very word Navigation is derived from the Sanskrit word NAVGATIH. The word navy is also derived from Sanskrit 'Nou'. The value of "pi" was first calculated by Budhayana, and he explained the concept of what is known as the Pythagorean Theorem. He discovered this in the 6th century long before the European mathematicians. According to the Gemological Institute of America, up until 1896, India was the only source for diamonds to the world. Algebra, trigonometry and calculus came from India. Quadratic equations were by Sridharacharya in the 11th century. The largest numbers the Greeks and the Romans used were 106 whereas Hindus used numbers as big as 10**53(10 to the power of 53) with specific names as early as 5000 BCE during the Vedic period. Even today, the largest used number is Tera 10**12(10 to the power of 12). Usage of anesthesia was well known in ancient India medicine.

The 13 largest multi-channel video providers in the U.S. (Comcast, DirecTV and Verizon FiOS, to name three), who make up roughly 94 percent of the market share, lost about 105,000 video subscribers in 2013 — a wide 280,000-subscriber swing from 2012’s addition of 175,000. Perhaps most directly responsible for this first-ever net loss is the increasingly out-of-control hemorrhaging of subscribers on the part of top cable companies: about 1.7 million customers cut their cords in 2013.

Despite the loss equaling only 0.1 percent of all subscribers, 2013 nonetheless marks the first year in which pay-TV giants actually came out with an overall year-end loss, according to a recent report by Leichtman Research Group. Cord-cutters the world over are muttering, “You have to start somewhere.”

Specifically, cable companies took the biggest hit — technically, the only hit to actually result in a net loss.

Top telephone service providers AT&T U-verse and Verizon FiOS, along with top satellite TV companies DirecTV and DISH, added a total of roughly 1.6 million new video subscribers in 2013; a total that counteracts the 1.7 million lost cable video subscribers. Thus, the total amount of subscribers among all top multi-channel video providers fell for the first time, by about 105,000, which, in the grand scheme of things, isn’t all that much. There are about 94.6 million total subscribers currently at stake with the aforementioned multi-channel video providers.

While the loss is far from monumental, it could be interpreted as a sign of the times. Those that are wary of the recent moves by big pay-TV players, such as the Comcast-Time Warner merge, may find solace in this report. Though it should be expected that any big changes will be incremental, It’s like trying to make a 180-degree turn with the Titanic: there might not appear to be any considerable progress at any one time, but it’s turning — slowly but surely.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Put all that upbeat news about Apple Pay usage on hold for a moment. A new report says that 85 percent of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus owners still haven’t used Apple’s mobile payments service.

As of this month, 6 percent of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus owners use Apple Pay, up from 5 percent in November 2014, according to “Apple Pay By The Numbers: Adoption And Behavior,” a report presented at Innovation Project 2015 by payments-focused company PYMNTS.com and shopper insights company InfoScout. Meanwhile, 9 percent of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus owners have tried Apple Pay but aren’t currently using it, up from 4 percent in November.

This means 85 percent of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus owners have never touched Apple Pay. This is down from 91 percent in November, but it still spotlights an uphill battle for adoption.

“The main reason those who had tried Apple Pay in the past, but didn’t on some transactions where it was available, seems to be forgetfulness – almost a third (32 percent) said they just forgot it was an option,” according to PYMNTS.com.

Apple should be “dead-focused” on point-of-sale and make sure there’s a trigger to compel users to use their phone instead of their card to pay, according to Jared Schrieber, co-founder and CEO of InfoScout.

“Apple Pay is not yet salient. When it comes up, it has not registered with the [consumer] that they should use Apple Pay,” Schrieber said. “There’s something lacking there in the habit-forming action at checkout.”

The report also notes that 31 percent of surveyed users didn’t know whether the Apple Pay-friendly merchant they were shopping at accepted the mobile payments option. Meanwhile, 20 percent of respondents said they prefer a different payment method.

The 6 percent of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus owners who regularly use Apple Pay have positive impressions of the service, as 79 percent said it was more convenient, 77 percent said it was faster, 73 percent said it was easier to use and 70 percent said it was more secure.

Despite the hype and eagerness of some users to make six-month-old Apple Pay a mainstream success, the current approach “doesn’t look promising,” according to David Evans, founder of management consulting firm Market Platform Dynamics.

As long as you haven’t been living under a rock for the past several months, then you have probably heard at least something about the sudden rise in value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These are the two most popular cryptocurrencies, both of which have seen gains of over 300% in just about 3 month’s time.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two most popular cryptocurrencies available, there are literally dozens upon dozens of others as well, and these cryptos trade on an open market daily. One such example is the Swarm City Cryptocurrency (SWT). In reality Swarm City is a “token” based on the aforementioned Ethereum cryptocurrency, and by viewing the technical analysis of recent trades, I am led to believe that now is a tremendous time to buy in. You see, technical analysis views trends, resistance, moving averages, etc. of an investment vehicle. This analysis is considered daily when trading stocks and foreign exchange currency, and now is being increasingly used in the trading of various cryptocurrencies and tokens.

Today, Swarm City (SWT) appears to have met resistance (see photo to the right). It’s a level that the trading value of the cryptocurrency broke toward the end of last month and then shot up nearly 200% before falling back down just recently. Currently Swarm City is again at this level, this time from above, so I expect to see it bounce off this level and shoot up once again.

If you then take a look at the daily chart (below), you will see that there is another level of resistance where Swarm City has bounced off of in the past. I expect the last red candle on this chart to drop back and for it to be followed by multiple green candles, representing a surge forward in the crypto.

It’s possible that it will ultimately break this resistance level, and fall to the next level of resistance at 0.00075, but my guess is that we will see the bounce now at around 0.11600. If this bounce occurs, I expect to see Swarm City shoot up at least to the 0.002 level but perhaps past the 0.0025 level.

(note: This article is my opinion only, and I am a trader of Swarm City.

The number of dimples on a golf ball varies, depending on the manufacturer and may even be different for different models made by the same manufacturer. The dimples are usually the same size as one another, but some golf balls have several different sizes of dimple on the same ball. Any number between 300 and 500 dimples is reasonable, and 336 is a common number. Not just any number will do. Golf balls are usually covered with dimples in a highly symmetrical way, and for many values of N, it is impossible to cover the golf ball uniformly without gaps. Symmetry is important or the ball will wobble or its flight will depend on which part of the ball is forwards or sideways as the ball spins. You can get an idea of how to space dimples uniformly around a sphere by thinking about the "platonic solids" -- the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron, and placing a dimple at the corners of an inscribed platonic solid. Variations on this theme give the corners of Buckminster Fuller’s geodesic domes, and also the possible symmetrical locations of dimples on a golf ball.

If you’re curious about why the dimples are there in the first place, see.

<|begin_of_text|>Hey everyone! This is the second post in my new node.js modules you should know about article series.

The first post was about dnode - the freestyle rpc library for node.

This time I'll introduce you to node-optimist - the lightweight options parser library. This library is also written by James Halliday (SubStack), my co-founder of Browserling and Testling.

Wonder how lightweight an options parser can be? Check this out:

var argv = require('optimist').argv;

And you're done! All options have been parsed for you and have been put in argv.

Here are various use cases. First off, it supports long arguments:

#!/usr/bin/env node var argv = require('optimist').argv; if (argv.rif - 5 * argv.xup > 7.138) { console.log('Buy more riffiwobbles'); } else { console.log('Sell the xupptumblers'); }

Now you can run this script with --rif and --xup arguments like this:

$./xup.js --rif=55 --xup=9.52 Buy more riffiwobbles $./xup.js --rif 12 --xup 8.1 Sell the xupptumblers

I know you want to buy more riffiwobbles and sell your xupptumblers.

Next, it supports short args:

#!/usr/bin/env node var argv = require('optimist').argv; console.log('(%d,%d)', argv.x, argv.y);

You can use -x and -y as arguments:

$./short.js -x 10 -y 21 (10,21)

Then node-optimist supports boolean arguments, both short, long and grouped:

#!/usr/bin/env node var argv = require('optimist').argv; if (argv.s) { console.log(argv.fr? 'Le chat dit:': 'The cat says: '); } console.log( (argv.fr?'miaou' :'meow') + (argv.p? '.' : '') );

And now you can invoke the script with various options:

$./bool.js -s The cat says: meow $./bool.js -sp The cat says: meow. $./bool.js -sp --fr Le chat dit: miaou.

Next, you can easily get to non-hypenated options via argv._ :

#!/usr/bin/env node var argv = require('optimist').argv; console.log('(%d,%d

<|begin_of_text|>How to Calculate Punching Force (Formula & Tonnage Calculator)

Punching Force Calculation Formula

If you punch round holes or square holes, or some other forms of holes through a given thickness of metal, you just want to know the force required to punch a hole in steel.

You can calculate the punching tonnage been required with the help of the following punching force calculation formula (blanking force formula):

Punching Force (KN) = Perimeter (mm) * Plate Thickness (mm) * Shear Strength (kn / mm2)

Converted into metric tons: dividing the result of KN by 9.81

Perimeter: add up the continuous line forming the boundary of a closed geometric figure.

Thickness: the thickness which will be piecing through by the punching mold.

the thickness which will be piecing through by the punching mold. Shear Strength: The physical properties of the plate, determined by the material of the sheet and can be found in the material manual.

Common materials’ shear strength are as follows: unit: KN/mm2

Aluminum Brass Low Carbon Steel Stainless Steel 0.1724 0.2413 0.3447 0.5171

e.g: If punching one square hole in the 3mm thickness low-carbon steel plate, side length 20mm, you will get:

Perimeter = 20×4 = 80mm

Thickness = 3mm

Shear Strength = 0.3447kn/mm2

Punch Force (KN) = 80 x 3 x 0.3447 = 82.728 KN Convert into tonnage: 82.728 KN ÷ 9.81 = 8.43 Ton

Punching Force Calculator

P.S: If you want to calculate hydraulic press tonnage, you can use our hydraulic press tonnage calculator.

Punch And Die Clearance

The clearance between punch and dies is represented by the total difference, which is one of the critical factors in the punching process.

For example, when using ø12 upper die and ø 12.25 lower die, the optimal clearance is 0.25mm.

Improper clearance will reduce the die service life, or burrs and lead to secondary cutting, the irregular opening will increase the demounting force, etc.

Besides, the die clearance is subject to the material and thickness, generally, for carbon steel plate, 12%-18% of the thickness is best.

<|begin_of_text|>Question: How many teachers still need to be hired at B.C. schools?

a) A lot, considering students are already one month into the school year.

b) Officially, 400, according to the number of postings on the B.C. Public School Employers’ website.

c) Far more than that, given that some postings are for multiple specialist positions and on-call teachers.

d) All of the above.

The correct answer is d. And the reason is as complicated as the start of this school year has been.

The Supreme Court of Canada ruling that reduced class sizes and required B.C. to hire 3,500 new teachers sparked unprecedented movement of teachers between education districts and a wave of new hires — which continues today.

“It’s challenging to pinpoint exact numbers, because the posting process right now is very fluid,” said Janet Stewart, chief administrative officer of the Public School Employers’ Association. “It’s quite a bit of a domino effect. So, to be looking at the posting numbers tells a more complex story.”

Stewart’s organization, which negotiates on behalf of school boards to get new teachers hired, said there are 400 postings for new teachers in B.C. right now. But each of those postings can represent multiple vacancies, and those vacancies can be for full-time, part-time or on-call work.

ON-CALL TEACHERS IN HIGH DEMAND

A Postmedia analysis of the postings on the website from early this week reveals vacancies for more than 900 full- or part-time jobs, in addition to 1,000 schools looking for on-call teachers.

Stewart said some of those postings are technically filled because in some cases the temporary teacher currently in the classroom will be officially hired once the paperwork is completed. In other cases, the person temporarily filling the role doesn’t want the job permanently so new teachers still need to be found — often in specialist roles.

Multiple school boards, including Burnaby, Coquitlam and the all-French Conseil Scolaire Francophone, have indicated multiple vacancies for bilingual teachers or librarians, which are always hard to find in B.C.

“We definitely have higher volumes this year and we definitely have pressure points around those highly specialized positions in particular,” Stewart said. “I’m hopeful it will calm down (this month).”

She also said that the data doesn’t mean 1,000 additional on-call teachers necessarily need to be hired in B.C., because schools share a pool of on-call teachers run by the district, and some work

all premises of the NGO had been sealed in view of NIA raids +

NEW DELHI: Controversial preacher Zakir Naik’s NGO Islamic Research Foundation (IRF) had allegedly offered a second donation of Rs 25 lakh to Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust (RGCT) in December 2011, months afterthat is already in the public realm.Documents seized during raids onshow that it had wanted the Rs 25 lakh donation to RGCT to be routed via Mumbai-based M H Saboo Siddique Maternity and General Hospital, but the hospital ended up utilizing the money itself after IRF kept vacillating on who should be the end beneficiary. Besides RGCT, it had also recommended Allahabad-based Kamla Nehru Memorial Hospital Society, and KARM, an NGO in Mumbai.Significantly, according to resolutions passed by IRF in June-July and November 2011, the two donations of Rs 50 lakh and Rs 25 lakh were extended to RGCT on the basis of applications received from the trust which has Congress president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi on its board of trustees. This contrasts with Congress’s claim, made when the Rs 50 lakh donation became public, that it never solicited donation from IRF. RGCT did not respond to TOI’s queries based on the documents in its possession.When contacted, IRF spokesperson Arif Malik said that given that“IRF does not have access to its records and hence cannot check donations made in the past”.As per documents with TOI, in case of both the donations, applications were received from RGCT, New Delhi, and placed before IRF’s board of trustees.The papers show that IRF, at a meeting of its trustees in November 2011, passed a resolution stating that applications for medical and educational aid was received from M H Saboo Siddique Hospital, RGCT and Bandra Education Society.The meeting resolved to donate Rs 5 lakh to the hospital as medical aid and Rs 5 lakh to the society as educational aid. It “further resolved that Rs 30,00,000 be donated to M H Saboo Siddique... hospital out of which they should retain Rs 5,00,000 and further donate Rs 25,00,000 to RGCT.” According to the documents, Rs 30 lakh was given to the hospital vide cheque No.964635 dated December 19, 2011.While RGCT did not respond

<|begin_of_text|>My son, Matthew, commented to me this afternoon (August 20, 2005) that there aren't very many Friday-the-13ths. He said that for some reason it is unlikely for the 13th to fall on a Friday. He flipped through the calendar and noted that there are no more months this year in which the 13th falls on a Friday.

The Frequency of Friday the 13th

I said that, in fact, Friday is the most frequent day on which the 13th falls. He was very doubtful. That launched me into a lengthy discussion of the calendar, and how wonderful it is that there is an exact multiple of 7 days in 400 years. For your edification, here's a summary of it.

Every fourth year is a leap year, so in 400 years there are about 300 years that have 365 days, and 100 years that have 366 days.

Except...

Every 100th year is not a leap year, so that makes 304 regular years and 96 leap years.

Except...

Every 400th year is a leap year (that's why 2000 was a leap year), so we have 303 regular years, and 97 leap years. We're done with the exceptions. Now here's the beauty part: 303 times 365 plus 97 times 366 is 146,097, which is an exact multiple of 7. That means the calendar repeats itself exactly, leap years and all, every 400 years.

Spreadsheet Calculation

It's not hard to write an Excel spreadsheet that calculates the frequency of the days of the week on which the 13th falls over the next 400 years. Here's how to do it. Start with the 13th of this month. Put that date in cell A1. (I put 8/13/2005 in that cell.) Then in cell A2, put the following formula:

=DATE(YEAR(A1+30),MONTH(A1+30),13)

Copy the contents of cell A2 down to all the cells from A3 through A4800. Now you have a table of the dates of all the 13ths of every month for the next 400 years.

Next, in cell B1, put this formula:

=MOD(A1,7)

Copy that formula from B1 down to all the cells from B2 through B4800. Here, numbers from 0 to 6 represent the days of the week

Are Germaine Greer and Richard Dawkins being transphobic? Johanna argues that their perspective is wrong because they both dehumanify gender and empty it of its subjectivity.

Beyond calling transphobia “transphobia”, we have very few ways of describing what is specifically wrong with bigotism directed towards transgender people (or people perceived to be transgender). It’s a truism that trans-conversations take about six times as long as a normal conversation because we have to use and often explain so much jargon that is unfamiliar to most people and even may transpeople themselves. We need better, more concise and descriptively intuitive terms to describe the kinds of abuse we face to help educate others why they are wrong.

For instance calling Greer’s words an assault would be disingenuous. They’re a presumably an honest opinion, and not really directed at any specific individuals, but rather are a discriminatory attitude and mode of thinking that she broadcast to the world.

So what was she doing? Why was what she said so vile and objectionable?

Simply put, she was attempting to take gender away from transpeople. We are labelled as (trans-)eunuchs by “de-gendering” us. Gender is a fundamental human characteristic. Everyone has one, and though most people have conventional binary genders, they are still within the spectrum of possible genders. No one tries to take cisgendered people’s gender away without an outcry!

Hence, “degendering”. Adjective: to literally or figuratively attempt to remove a person’s self-determined gender and/or the act of physically removing gender characteristics from a person.

So this is what Greer did wrong: “she degendered us”, and compare that idea to things like being “emasculated” or the kind of misogyny that insidiously devalues women. Because it really is the same thing just with a different target.

We can also describe potential social-consequences of ‘degendering’ by comparing it to ‘outing’ someone, or stigmatising a skin colour, a religion or even being cis-gendered. “Degendering”, we argue, is what Richard Dawkins demonstrated with his tweet dated 5:34 am, 26th October, 2015.

“Is a trans-woman a woman? Purely semantic. If you define by chromosomes, no. If by self-identification, yes. I call her ‘she’ out of courtesy.”

This is not transphobia

A 13-year-old boy fended off two hardened felons who were attempting to break into his house by using his mother’s gun to protect himself while home alone.

The boy saw the men breaking into the back of his home, “at which time he feared for his safety,” and grabbed his mother’s gun, the document states. He began firing at them, and the Sheriff’s office reported that they returned fire.

In a heated shootout, the boy shot Brown three times, and Bennett drove him to the hospital where he later died. The gray Chevy Sonic they were driving had bullet holes in it from the boy chasing them, the affidavit states.

Where was the media coverage of this brave young man’s heroic act, how about a Tweet from President Obama commending his bravery. Without the protection of his mothers gun the boy, and his mother, who was due home later that afternoon, would both be dead.

According to reports the young boy, who is not being identified, was home alone when he grew suspicious of a car that pulled up outside around 1:30 p.m. Moments later, the two suspects went to the back of the house and attempted to break in, at such time, the boy, fearing for his safety, grabbed his mother’s handgun.

In patch 2.0.5, Rend´s ability to crit was removed. Instead, crit chance and crit damage were directly included in calculating its damage.

Expected Mutilate damage per tick based on patch 2.0.5 changes = 1694 * 76.45 * (1 + 0.35*4.5) * 0.4 = 133,391.489

Actual ingame values in patch 2.0.6:

> damage tick reflected on monster health bar numbers = 133,392 (12 frames, non-crit)

> damage tick reflected on monster health bar numbers = 733,656 (12 frames, crit)

> damage tick displayed above monster = 533,566 (48 frames, crit)

>damage tick displayed above monster = 2,934,613 (48 frames, crit)

Conclusion: Rend is now able to crit again on top of crit mod*** being included in its damage calculation. This means that a crit Rend benefits from crit damage twice (squared). A similar behavior was confirmed in the past for certain weapon procs like Odyn Son, Bul-Kathos´s Oath and Maximus fire chain. The difference between these calculations is that Rend doesn´t benefit from attack speed at all while the aforementioned item procs do (aps is also directly included in their damage calculation instead of affecting their tick frequency). On the other hand, the weapon procs don´t benefit from elemental skill bonuses while Rend does (from physical).

***crit mod = 1 + crit chance/100 * crit damage/100

It is unclear whether this is an intended change to make the skill competitive again or just a "bug" byproduct of making the Rend damage bonus on gear work again.

1. Furious Charge alternates hands to deal damage. Had to retest because some people were doubting this. Next time simply equip a white weapon in your OH and use a skill twice in a row. If there´s a huge damage difference, the skill alternates damage.

2. Rend:

> displays a white damage number above monsters 53 frames after fury globe response (skill cost) / hitting the target.

> subsquent displayed ticks occur in 48 frame intervals and you always get 7 ticks total.

> the last displayed tick is logically always smaller than the others

> displayed tick sequence: 160%-160%-160%-160%-160%-160%-40% weapon damage

For Season 3, American Horror Story: Coven has told the secret history of witches and witchcraft in America, with a cast of talented actresses that included Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates, Angela Bassett, Patti LuPone, Sarah Paulson, Frances Conroy, Lily Rabe, Taissa Farmiga, Emma Roberts, Gabourey Sidibe and even Stevie Nicks.

During this exclusive phone interview with Collider, actress Angela Bassett talked about how she came to be a part of the show this season, how it was the best of all worlds, bringing the history of the real woman to her portrayal in the present day, talking to actual voodouns, how invaluable it was to really get to shoot in New Orleans, and that she would absolutely be willing to entertain the idea of returning to the series, for a future season. Check out what she had to say after the jump.

Collider: How did you come to be a part of the show, this season?

ANGELA BASSETT: My agent reached out to Ryan [Murphy] and said, “What about Angela, for American Horror Story?” And he was like, “Yes, because she’s who I’m thinking of for Marie Laveau.” So, they reached out to me and said that I should go in and take a meeting with him for the character. I didn’t know that I was his choice for that. I was familiar with the show, but I hadn’t watched it because I don’t really like horror shows, horror movies, or any of that. I’m really a lightweight, in terms of that. But, I watched both seasons before going in to meet him. And I’m definitely a fan of Marie Laveau and New Orleans. What I saw, in addition to the horror, was that the writing was so wonderful and the characters were so realized. It wasn’t just fright night, so I could appreciate that. So, I went in to meet him and he told me what he wanted to do. New Orleans is one of my favorite cities, and I knew something about the historical figure of Marie Laveau, so I was excited about that, and I think he could see that in me. I don’t think the country, as a whole,

So how big is it, exactly? Well, according to our best estimates, the supermassive black hole is roughly 21 billion times the size of the Sun, and its event horizon (an area so dense and powerful that light can’t escape its gravity) measures 130 billion kilometers in diameter. That’s about 15 times the diameter of Neptune’s orbit around the Sun, according to scientists at the Hubble Space Telescope. At one point, the black hole was fueling itself on a process called hot accretion. Space stuff like gases, dust, and galactic debris fell towards the black hole and created an accretion disk. Then that spinning disk of space junk, accelerated by the strong gravitational pull of the largest known black hole, emitted huge jets of energy out into the galaxy.

During that active period, NGC 4889 would have classified as a quasar (quasi-stellar radio source) thanks to the black hole’s emissions of up to a thousand times more energy than our Milky Way galaxy. But the black hole is now in dormant mode because there isn’t any more sustenance stored in the orbiting accretion disk. “The accretion disk sustained the supermassive black hole’s appetite until the nearby supply of galactic material was exhausted. Now, napping quietly as it waits for its next celestial snack, the supermassive black hole is dormant”, says the Hubble Space Telescope website.

Of course, the announcement posted with new photos of the NGC 4889 galaxy is quick to point out that the pictures don’t exactly capture the likeness of the supermassive black hole. It is impossible to observe a black hole directly, but scientists have been able to identify the implied presence of a black hole by analyzing the way celestial objects interact with some invisible force. For this particular black hole in the NGC 4889 galaxy, scientists used instruments on the Keck II Observatory and the Gemini North Telescope to measure the velocity of stars moving around the center point of the galaxy. The stars’ specific velocities re what allowed scientists to calculate the incredible size of NGC 4889’s black hole.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Apple is known for its crazy patents, but some of them are much more realistic. On Tuesday, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted the company a patent for a special construction process that involves LiquidMetal and sapphire glass displays. The patent approval occurred right after Apple announced that it has exclusive rights to LiquidMetal’s unique alloy until 2015.

In scientific terms, LiquidMetal is a bulk amorphous alloy and is considered an exotic metal. It may look like a metal in liquid form, but it moves like molten plastic. So far, LiquidMetal has only been used to make a SIM card ejector, some military equipment, and medical devices. The technology has been put to the test, but it has never been used to create a consumer smartphone or tablet. Nonetheless, it seems that Apple may have plans to forge its future iPhones and iPads using the LiquidMetal technology.

Apple’s patent describes the new use it has in mind for LiquidMetal and how it will aid in stabilizing the sapphire glass displays in future iDevices. Stabilization is necessary, so that when you inevitably drop your iPhone, the glass doesn’t shatter or simply pop off. Back in 2007, Apple used a plastic chassis and a rubberized gasket to protect the display from sudden impacts. This technology is still used in all other iPhone models up to the iPhone 5S.

The new patent aims to avoid all these annoying in-between steps and go directly from the metal chassis to the display, using LiquidMetal in a new metal injection molding process. That way, Apple can form sapphire glass directly into the iPhone or iPad’s metal bezel. The patent indicates that plastic can also be used, but the emphasis is on the idea of using LiquidMetal to ensure the strongest bond and protection between the glass display and metal chassis.

Clearly, this technology is very cutting edge, but its application is untested in mobile devices, so don’t get too pumped up, thinking LiquidMetal will debut with the iPhone 6 this September (or August, depending on which rumors you believe. Read our roundup here). However, given Apple’s agreement with GT Technologies to manufacture enormous amounts of sapphire glass, it’s probably safe to assume that a sapphire glass display is forthcoming on the long-awaited iPhone 6.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

GREENVILLE, N.C. --- Maurice Kemp scored 20 points and Robert Sampson posted a double-double to lead East Carolina past Loyola (Md.) in a CIT quarterfinal Tuesday inside Williams Arena at Minges Coliseum.

The Pirates (21-12) will host Evansville in the final four round of the CIT Saturday at 5 p.m. The Purple Aces advanced to this weekend's semifinal with an 84-83 win over Cansisius on Tuesday in Buffalo.

Kemp posted his seventh consecutive 20-point game, scoring 10 points in each half. Sampson finished with 13 points and 11 rebounds for this sixth double-double of the season with Miguel Paul adding 12 points and nine assists.

Dylon Cormier led the Greyhounds (23-12) with 12 points, while Robert Olson added 11 off the bench. Anthony Winbush had 10 points.

Coming out of halftime, Loyola scored the first six points and caused ECU to take an early timeout. The Pirates scored six straight points out of the timeout, tying the game at 38.

The two teams traded baskets for the next several minutes and when the under-12 media timeout came Loyola held a 45-44 lead but then Kemp took the lead back for ECU for good.

Kemp scored seven of the next nine points, including the first five, and the Pirates went ahead 53-45 on a one-handed dunk from the Miami, Fla. senior.

$328.00 in dividends

Added $1,400 to dividend portfolio

It’s been a great month for my dividend portfolio as I have added $1,400 to the investment account and received $328.00 in dividend payments for the month of June. This is a staggering amount and it’s the first time I can realize the power of dividend income and it’s ability to truly help someone live the passive income lifestyle. While I’m far off from achieving that goal it’s enough to keep the dream alive.

Account Deposits

I had some unexpected purchases this month so I was unable to put a large amount into my account like I did last month. That didn’t stop me from adding $1,400 this month though.

I automatically pull out $200 per paycheck with automatic deposit and at the end of the month, I throw whatever is left into the account. This time it happened to be a spare $1k.

$200 + $200 + $1000 = $1400

Dividend Payouts

This has been an amazing month for my dividend producing portfolio. Twenty three companies paid me a piece of their profits just for holding a few shares of their stock.

There was one surprise this month:

NGG – They paid out a special dividend of $5.42/share this month that somehow got past my radar. They are a European based company so their dividend fluctuates quite a bit. They have their normal dividend coming in August as well. Their current yield is 10% with a PE ratio of just over 13.

The rest of my dividends are broken down as follows:

PSX $11.20 SBSI $11.20 PFE $5.12 F $11.40 BA $4.26 V $1.65 SO $12.76 NGG $54.22 XOM $6.93 TGT $12.00 IBM $9.00 SDIV $12.17 CVX $4.32 JNJ $8.40 MAIN $0.93 DUK $25.65 QCOM $18.24 FLO $25.50 MAIN $1.38 GILD $10.40 TROW $26.22 ARCC $38.00 CLDT $17.05

Monthly Total: $328.00

Stock Purchases

I didn’t buy a whole lot this month but I did manage to add to a few positions on some dips.

A Florida restaurateur who operates roughly 40 Denny’s locations and five Hurricane Grill & Wings franchises in Florida, Virginia and Georgia intends to add a 5 percent surcharge to customers’ bills to offset costs from ObamaCare beginning in January 2014 when the Affordable Care Act is fully implemented.

“People are trying to find ways to avoid the penalties and to avoid having to pay for ObamaCare,” John Metz told FoxNews.com. “Everyone’s looking for a way to not have to provide insurance for their employees. It’s essentially a huge tax on all us business people.”

To further offset the costs, Metz, who oversees roughly 1,200 employees as president and CEO of RREMC Restaurants, LLC, said he also will slash most of the staff's time to fewer than 30 hours per week. That change will be announced to employees next month, he said.

“I want to explain it to everybody, to let them know what’s coming down the pike,” he said. “We like to keep our employees informed.”

The changes will force some front-of-the-house employees to look for second jobs, Metz said, but he simply cannot afford the penalties associated with ObamaCare.

[pullquote]

“It’s a great concept,” he said. “We want to have everyone insured. The problem is, who is going to pay for it and how are we going to accomplish this?”

Under the current law, employers with more than 50 full-time (or equivalent) workers will be charged a penalty for the number of employees exceeding 30 full-time staffers who are not covered. With an average of 35 full-time employees per location, Metz said the $2,000 penalty would total roughly $70,000 per restaurant. Current coverage costs Metz up to $6,000 annually per full-time employee, he said. He currently provides coverage to about 250 employees.

“It’s going to be a big issue for all of us — for my employees and for me,” said Metz, who has been in the industry since 1975. “The ones that are working more than 28 hours, they’re going to act as if I’m cutting their hours and they’ll have to find another job.”

At Denny’s restaurants operated by Metz, the average check is $9, he said, meaning the ObamaCare surcharge if implemented would be 45 cents on that bill. At Hurricane Grill & Wings locations, where the average bill

<|begin_of_text|>How many atoms are there in a kilogram of silicon? This number is Avogadro’s constant and working out its value is one of the more important tasks that materials scientists face.

Today, a group of physicists reveal the answer. They say there are 6.02214084(18) × 10^23 atoms in a single crystal of silicon weighing about a kilogram. And they say they know this is right because they’ve counted them. Yep, counted them.

Actually, they counted the number of atoms in a unit volume of silicon and measured the size of this volume. The number of times this fits into a lump of exactly 1 mole of near perfect single crystal sphere of silicon is Avogadro’s number.

To have established this number to such accuracy is clearly an important piece of work but just how impressive is put in perspective by the monumental efforts of the international consortium behind it.

The work began in 2004 when a Russian group created a sample of silicon flouride with a specific isotopic content at the Central Design Bureau of Machine Building in St. Petersburg. A team at the Institute of Chemistry of High-Purity Substances of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Nizhny-Novgorod then turned this into a polycrystal of silicon hydride which a group at the Leibniz-Institut fur Kristallzuchtung in Berlin used to grow a 5kg lump of pure monocrystalline silicon in 2007.

The Australian Centre for Precision Optics then took samples from this lump and shaped them into quasi-perfect spheres. They then made an x-ray interferometer from the left over silicon to determine its crystal structure. They also measured crystals’ surfaces to see what kind of crud had built up there and would therefore have to be taken into account in the final calculations. (Various copper, nickel and silicon oxides had built up on the surface.)

Various groups then measured the mass of the spheres by comparing them to the platinum-iridium test kilograms owned by the PTB (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt) in Germany, the National Metrology Institute of Japan in Tskuba and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures in France.

The team then measured the volume of the spheres using optical interferometry. And the isotope content was measured by teams at the University of Warsaw, the Institute of Mineral Resources of the Chinese Academy of Science and Institute for Physics of Microstructures of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Bucharest City Hall has a large apparatus compared to other big cities in Europe.

It has 860 employees, and 10 mayor’s personal advisers for a population of 1.88 million people on a surface of 228 square kilometers. By comparison, Berlin has 207 employees, at a population of 3.46 million on an area of 891 sq km, according to data from the National Council of Small and Medium-Sized Companies in Romania (CNIPMMR).

The council has been critical of the Bucharest City Hall’s plan to create 19 public service companies that will be controlled by the municipality.

CNIPMMR representatives explained that in other EU member states the local authorities normally set up a small number of companies in uncompetitive, subsidized areas. In Vienna, for example, there are three municipal companies, at a number of 2.26 million inhabitants on an area of 414 sq km. Madrid has seven municipal companies at a population of 3.16 million on an area of 605 sq km.

One week ago, the General Council of Bucharest City Hall approved the creation of 19 companies managed by the City Hall that will provide services in energy, public lighting, hospital administration, sports facilities, tourist attractions.

5120x2880 at 27 inches comes out at 218 PPI for a total of 14.7 million pixels.

What could be better then pancakes? 2 Ingredient Banana Pancakes. These 2 ingredient banana pancakes are so simple and delicious. You’ve probably seen this recipe floating around the internet for quite some time now, I figured I better jump on the pancake bandwagon. I’m glad I did, and you’ll be glad too!

Directions for 2 Ingredient Banana Pancakes

All you need to make these amazing, delicious pancakes is a very ripe banana and 2 eggs. Throw it all in a blender (minus the shells and peel of course) and give it a whiz. Cook your pancakes just like a regular pancake! When they start to bubble it’s time to flip them!

The beautiful thing about these 2 ingredient banana pancakes is that they are so versatile. You can top them with butter and syrup, peanut butter, chocolate chips, berries – the pancakes are your oyster. Wait, gross. You know what I mean.

I chose to top mine with banana coins and melted peanut butter. These pancakes taste so delicious it’s hard to believe they aren’t loaded with sugar.

How about dem photography skills? I’m getting better! I finally discovered what those fancy symbols on my camera do. It’s a work in progress, but I absolutely love my camera. If anyone is interested I use this camera: Nikon D3100 14.2MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens

<|begin_of_text|>A 31 year old file-sharer escaped prison this morning when he received a heavy fine and a suspended sentence for uploading music and movies. The court refrained from putting the defendant in prison, saying that the music industry needs to take some responsibility for the current situation.

After a retrial, a 31 year old man from LinkÃ¶ping, Sweden, was found guilty this morning in the District Court.

The court decided that for uploading 4,500 music tracks and 30 movies with the filesharing application Direct Connect, the defendant should receive a heavy fine and a suspended prison sentence. Initially the file-sharer had been accused of uploading around 23,000 music tracks, but Sweden’s Anti-Piracy Agency’s (APB) use of questionable investigative techniques forced the prosecutor to withdraw some of the charges.

In its verdict, the LinkÃ¶ping District Court decided that due to the large number of files involved in the case, handing out just fines wasn’t enough, hence the suspended sentence. This situation of sharing many thousands of files at once affects the BitTorrent user a lot less than those using other methods of sharing, which is probably why the music industry prefers to target users using ‘folder sharing’ clients, such as DirectConnect, LimeWire and KaZaA.

Thankfully, the court denied the prosecutor’s request to have the man thrown in prison and said that this is “a task for the government, that by legislative means or in other ways take the necessary actions” to come to a solution to the problem. In fact, the court implied that the reason it issued only a suspended sentence was because the copyright industry has to take some responsibility for the situation it finds itself in.

Although escaping prison would’ve been his number one aim, the fine received by the file-sharer will hurt. In Sweden there is a system of “day fines” that is regulated by how large an income the guilty party has. In the case of day fines, two figures are given, for example ’40 day fines of 50 kronor’ (that is to say, 2000 kronor). The first figure shows how seriously the court considers the offense (culpability) and the latter figure is determined depending on the accused’s financial situation.

He was given 40 day fines, amounting to some 10000 kronor ($1650) and must also pay the court costs of 44670 kronor ($7360).

Hmm, if we look at $g(x) = f(f(x)) = x^2-2$ and find the fixpoints $t_0=-1,t_1=2$ then we might assume a solution $h(x)$ for $g(x) = h(x-2)+2 $ and then from this we search for the half-iterate of $h(x)$ defining $h(x-2)+2 = w(w(x-2))+2$ and shall have a solution of the problem by $f(x)=w(x+2)-2$, hopefully having nonzero range of convergence at least in the vicinity of the fixpoint $t_1$.

With this ansatz we find that $$h(x) = g(x+2)-2 = (x+2)^2-4 = 4x+1x^2$$ could be a replacement for $g(x)$ and from this we get the leading terms for the power series of its half-iterate $$w(x) = 2 x + 1/6 x^2 - 1/90 x^3 + 1/720 x^4 - 7/32400 x^5 \\ + 161/4276800 x^6 - 391/55598400 x^7 + O(x^8) $$ by standard algebraic manipulations. (To check this insert $w(x)$ for $x$ in that leading terms)

Thus $f(x)$ can be written as a power series around (fixpoint) $2$: $$f(x) = 2+ 2 (x-2) + 1/6 (x-2)^2 - 1/90 (x-2)^3 + 1/720 (x-2)^4 - 7/32400 (x-2)^5 \\ + 161/4276800 (x-2)^6 - 391/55598400 (x-2)^7 + O(x^8) $$ (The link gives a confirmation using WolframAlpha and a $\cosh()$ /$\text{arccosh}()$-formula, see my other answer)

By the first $64$ terms it looks as if $w(x)$ has a positive range of convergence; and computing a couple of examples gives $$ \begin{array} {c|c|c|c} x &g(x)=h(1-t_1)+t_1 & f(x) = w

<|begin_of_text|>In fiscal year 2015, BC Hydro paid $1.064 billion to independent power producers (IPPs), an average of 7.9¢ a KWh.

In fiscal year 2016, BC Hydro paid $1.229 billion to independent power producers and, in the quarter ended March 31 2016, it paid 9.8¢ a KWh, a 23% increase of the unit cost in the preceding fiscal year.

In fiscal year 2015, BC Hydro sold electricity to Alberta and Western USA for $775 million, netting an average of 3.5¢ a KWh.

In fiscal year 2016, BC Hydro sold electricity to Alberta and Western USA for $460 million, netting an average of 3.1¢ a KWh, a 14% decrease in the unit cost in the preceding fiscal year.

Had IPP’s sold their power for the same price that BC Hydro realized in trade markets, they would have realized:

In FY 2015, $591 million less ;

; In FY 2016, $782 million less.

The deals will get better for IPPs. BC Hydro’s website now announces that it has contracted for 19,290 GWh from these private producers. That is 35% more than purchases in the just completed fiscal year and follows an established trend.

The chart is prepared from annual sales reports issued by BC Hydro. This shows the total sales to the utility’s three main customers groups: residential, commercial and heavy industrial.

This entire subject is not one that BC Liberals like to discuss. I’m told they have BC Hydro working on a revised demand forecast and have had major problems trying to force square pegs into round holes. Even without Site C, it would be impossible to justify further purchases from private power producers. If BC Hydro continues dumping power on external trade markets, prices will be reduced to even lower levels.

That outcome will make expensive Site C power an even bigger financial disaster.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

's new Engel Weisse hit shelves in late July, the German-style brew will have the lowest alcohol content of any Colorado beer sold in a liquor store -- 4 percent ABV, or 3.2 percent alcohol by weight.

And it would have been much lower, between 2.5 and 3.4 percent ABV, if Elevation hadn't received a couple of reminders about a controversial rule that forbids liquor stores from selling low-alcohol beers, those that weigh in at under 4 percent ABV.

"We took a deeper look into the law and talked to some of our distributors and some retail outlets...and decided to change the recipe a little bit," says Elevation spokesman Xandy Bustamante. "The difference in taste is very, very minimal."

The beer is a traditional German-style Berliner weisse, meaning it has crisp, sour notes that make it good for hot-weather drinking. Elevation aged its version in second-use whiskey barrels that have been washed so that they impart more of the oak flavors.

In Germany, these unfiltered wheat-based beers are served with sweet syrups, like raspberry and woodruff; Elevation will do the same in its Poncha Springs taproom.

"We wanted to do something sour for a long time, and we decided that we specifically wanted to make a Berliner weisse because it's an everyday sour, and one that you can have a couple of because it's low in alcohol," Bustamante says.

Originally, Elevation planned to brew the beer at 2.5 percent ABV, which would have made it around the same alcohol content as similar beers in Germany, and then it moved it up to 3.4 percent. The brewery even made a batch of Engel Weisse at that ABV -- before realizing that the alcohol content was still too low to be legally sold in liquor stores.

"We were disappointed when we had to change it," Bustamante says. "But since draft accounts and liquor stores are 100 percent of our business, we adjusted the recipe."

The change was forced by a Colorado Department of Revenue rule that received a lot of attention in 2010 and 2011 amid the ongoing

Friday the 13th is considered an unlucky day in Western superstition. It occurs when the 13th day of the month in the Gregorian calendar falls on a Friday, which happens at least once every year but can occur up to three times in the same year, for example in 2015, on 13 February, 13 March and 13 November. In 2017, it occurred twice, on 13 January and 13 October. In 2018, it also occurred twice, on 13 April and 13 July. There will be two Friday the 13ths every year until 2020; 2021 and 2022 will have just one occurrence each.

A Friday the 13th occurs during any month that begins on a Sunday.

History

The fear of the number 13 has been given a scientific name: "triskaidekaphobia"; and on analogy to this the fear of Friday the 13th is called paraskevidekatriaphobia, from the Greek words Paraskeví (Παρασκευή, meaning "Friday"), and dekatreís (δεκατρείς, meaning "thirteen").[3]

The Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci by Leonardo da Vinci

The superstition surrounding this day may have arisen in the Middle Ages, "originating from the story of Jesus' last supper and crucifixion" in which there were 13 individuals present in the Upper Room on the 13th of Nisan Maundy Thursday, the night before his death on Good Friday.[4][5] While there is evidence of both Friday[6] and the number 13 being considered unlucky, there is no record of the two items being referred to as especially unlucky in conjunction before the 19th century.[7][8][9]

An early documented reference in English occurs in Henry Sutherland Edwards' 1869 biography of Gioachino Rossini, who died on a Friday 13th:

He [Rossini] was surrounded to the last by admiring friends; and if it be true that, like so many Italians, he regarded Fridays as an unlucky day and thirteen as an unlucky number, it is remarkable that on Friday 13th of November he passed away.[10]

It is possible that the publication in 1907 of Thomas W. Lawson's popular novel Friday, the Thirteenth,[11] contributed to disseminating the superstition. In the novel, an unscrupulous broker
