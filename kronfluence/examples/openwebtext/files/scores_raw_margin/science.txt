<|begin_of_text|>A few weeks ago I spoke on a panel at Middle of the Map Fest called “Home Grown Tech for Social Good.” One of the questions I was asked was “How do you prepare girls for sexism in the tech industry?” I tend to treat panels like Twitter, with short, succinct responses so other panelists have time to weigh in. My <= 140 character response to this question was “We don’t, we empower them.”

But that’s not nearly enough information to cover this issue.

I wanted to share the two stories above to demonstrate a common theme: In the workplace we often encounter awful people and terrible bosses. It’s a fact of life. Anna and Tiffany had very similar experiences with unpleasant coworkers and bosses setting them up to fail, so why were their reactions and faith in their skills so different?

It’s because society has told Anna that styling hair is an acceptable profession for a woman. She’s never had to convince someone that she is, in fact, a hair stylist. She went to school with classes full of women. She’s never worried about her ability to mix colors correctly or leave a toner on for just the right amount of time due to her possession of ovaries.

When she had enough of a hostile work environment, she simply moved on to a new place. Anna takes awful people and terrible bosses in her workplace in stride, because society hasn’t told her she deserves to be treated poorly in her particular workplace because of her gender.

Society has not been so encouraging for Tiffany. She was told that computers and electronics were for boys, she attended school as an obvious and glaring minority, she had to convince people every step of the way that she is, in fact, a programmer. When her boss criticized her, yet provided no advice for improvement, she wondered if she had what it takes to be a programmer. Society has told her as a woman she lacks the ability to think logically and critically, key factors in writing code.

Tiffany’s story is not unique. I can’t count the number of times I’ve had to convince a professional, a new acquaintance, a loan officer or another programmer that I am, in fact, a programmer. I can’t remember all the times I’ve walked into a technology meet-up or group and had the room fall silent at the arrival of a woman. I do remember feeling the pain and rejection of peers for my excitement of computers and technology, because society didn’t support girls liking those things.

So why don’t we “prepare girls for sexism?” When a doctor

<|begin_of_text|>Ever since my university days I have observed that be it college, open source communities or the workplace, the ratio of men to women is significantly skewed. There are a couple of factors that contribute to this. Apart from lack of awareness about the opportunities available and how to make best use of them, cultural fabrics and mindsets also play an important role. All these and much more were the centre of discussion at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in computing conference held in Phoenix, Arizyyona from 4th to 10 October this year. As a speaker and an attendee, I consider myself fortunate to be able to see perspectives from a much closer level and do my bit to improve the situation.

The Conference started off on the sunny morning of the 8th October 2014. It saw a variety of talks ranging from technical topics like Molecular Biophysics, Data Science, DevOps, Networks to more generic skill-building ones like Parenting in the tech world, Interview Strategies, how to make your resume stand out and many that delved into the everyday lives of a developer, quality analyst, business analyst etc.

As a mentor in the student opportunity lab, I met many enthusiastic young women. Being a follower of the Free Software Movement and the Open Source world, I wanted to share my learning with the larger community out there. The format of my talk was different from the usual style presentation, with an intimate audience of ten people at a time. We did multiple such sessions, each spanning about 20 minutes or so.

Initial butterflies were soon taken over by healthy discussions at my table as i told attendees about the concept of FOSS, its importance, community structure and how it was relevant for them to know about it and contribute as a student. Having so many energetic women around with a zeal to make a change and listening to their stories definitely filled me up with a lot of positive energy!

Among the multiple sessions that happened on that day, I got a plethora of questions.. Ranging from “what exactly is open source?”, “Oh! I thought its something on github!” to “Do we need to pay for getting an open source licence?”. Answering these and clearing many similar mind blocks regarding the specifics of open source world was a very rewarding experience.

The rest of the conference was mostly spent at the ThoughtWorks booth. We talked to a huge number of people, telling them about ThoughtWorks, what we do and what are our practices. Our “I am the next grace hopper” frame was the centre of attraction

But the two policy issues could not be further apart in terms of legislative remedies. Though both are complex and thorny matters, their respective roadblocks to resolution are diametrically opposite.

The constitutional right to bear arms is nearly as old as our country but America’s mental health policy dates only from post-World War II. The 2nd amendment was ratified in 1791. Harry Truman signed the “National Mental Health Act,” into law in 1946.

Though both issues are driven by unique interests, one constituency needs enormous investments of medical and psychological diagnostic research and a commitment to providing national and local support for overmatched families and schools educating thousands of children with special needs. On the other side of the checkbook, the gun owning citizenry is led by a well-informed private industry with seemingly limitless wealth — much of it dedicated to discouraging government legislators from authorizing restrictions.

In the aftermath of the Newtown, Conn., massacre, a number of traditionally pro-gun-rights legislators have come out in support of a ban on assault rifles, or otherwise signaled they may be willing to budge on new gun laws. The NRA gives lawmakers a grade on their gun stance, which can be influential in their elections. The scale ranges from an A-plus rating (the legislator consistently votes with the NRA and makes a “vigorous effort to promote and defend the Second Amendment”) to an F, (a “true enemy of gun owners’ rights”).

<|begin_of_text|>It’s been relatively quiet around here lately so how about a rousing debate on race in America?

Iraqi war veteran Colby Bohannon has founded a group called the Former Majority Association For Equality and plans to offer five scholarships for qualified male students – the only catch, they have to be at least one quarter Caucasian. When interviewed by the American Statesmen Bohannon, who says his group doesn’t take a stand for or against Affirmative Action, said he’s just not sure that white men are the majority anymore.

Okay, NO ONE should be denied an opportunity for an education, regardless of race, religion or color. But opportunities are not equal and fair is a concept that really works best when forecasting the weather. I wonder if Bohannon has any idea of the numbers of very smart students of color who couldn’t afford to go to college or were denied admission for various reasons. Reading this story brought me right back to the discussions I had at points in my career in various newsrooms where someone told me I was ‘lucky” I was black because my resume tape would stand out. Forget the fact that I was typically one of only two people of color working in the newsroom.

I’m not exactly certain this plan of his wasn’t hatched on a bar napkin somewhere over a pitcher of margaritas because it doesn’t seem to be real well thought-out.

Bohannon says he’s not sure white men are the majority anymore, which, for the life of me, I can’t figure out why that’s such an earth-shattering concept. I guess because I’m not a white man. Bohannon would do himself well by snagging one of those scholarships and take a class on how to use the Internet because a quick Google search will tell you according to the latest figures, white people (not Hispanic) make up over 65 percent of the population. If we assume half of them are men, that’s still more than double the nearest group, African Americans (nearly 13 percent). I’m not even going to go into the history of race in this country and how people of color have long been discriminated against. Something tells me it would be lost on him.

Se let’s start today’s GEM Debate…

Should there be a scholarship for white men only? If so why? If not, why not?

When two students asked Eric Anderson, a sociology lecturer at Bath University's department of education, if he had heard of the game "gay chicken", he shook his head. "I had no clue what it was," he says. "So they showed me." The students – both men – went in to kiss each other.

"The challenge was that whoever pulled out first was the loser," Anderson explains. "But because men are no longer afraid of this, they ended up kissing." Anderson was inspired to carry out a new research project.

Growing up in the US, Anderson did his PhD on "the intersection of sport, masculinities and declining homophobia" after coming out at 25.

His research subjects caught the interest of students at Bath, hence the question about "gay chicken". Anderson discovered that the game had almost died out in the UK in the last few years "because nobody ever loses", and began to consider heterosexual university students' views of kissing other men. "I started going through my students' Facebook profiles, with their permission, and was inundated with hundreds of photos of men kissing on their nights out," Anderson reports.

He was intrigued, and decided to investigate further via formal research. He interviewed 145 students, a mixture of men studying sports-related subjects and every third man who left the library on a particular day, from two different universities, plus other male students from a sixth-form college. The results of his survey showed 89% of the polled men saying they were happy to kiss another man on the lips through friendship. And almost 40% added that they had engaged in "sustained kissing, initially for shock value, but now just for 'a laugh'."

"I started telling people about it, but found that a lot of academics literally did not believe me," Anderson explains. "One professor excused it as'something in the water at Bath' – even though the research covered three different educational establishments. Others flatly told me that they did not believe me. From their 'adult' perspective, this action was unfathomable. They have been stamped with attitudes of acceptable behaviour as a part of their entry into adulthood, and kissing was not permitted between men when they were young. So although they had not been in students' clubs or pubs in 20 or more years, they assumed that nothing had changed. This is known as human plasticity theory; people are stamped with a belief system

She is not allowed to compete.

Olympic ski jumping is a men's-only domain. Since the first winter Games in 1924, men have been swooping down snowy ramps at 55 m.p.h. and springing into flight – human rockets hurtling chin-first, hands thrown behind, and skis angled forward. With nothing but speed and their skis to aid them, they fly the length of a football field or farther – a feat of technical genius disguised in balletic grace.

But women can do it, too – the best often flying as far as men.

With women now included in such formerly all-male Olympic events as boxing, wrestling, bobsleigh, and luge, the last Olympic door closed to women is ski jumping.

But American ski jumper Lindsey Van – who set the record on the 90-meter jump when the Olympic venue opened in Vancouver, British Columbia, last year and is the reigning world champion – hasn't given up on prying that door open. It's a logical step for the 24-year-old, who, since age 7, has been soaring over Earth's mundane limits on what is possible.

She and more than a dozen other women jumpers from Slovenia to Norway hope to legally force the addition of women's jumping before the Games open Feb. 12. Their lawsuit against the Vancouver Organizing Committee (VANOC) contends that not allowing women to jump for gold is a form of discrimination under Canadian laws that prohibit gender discrimination in government activities.

A Canadian judge, last summer, agreed: It is discrimination.

But her ruling concluded that while VANOC is subject to those antidiscrimination laws, it can't control the events – that's the domain of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The IOC voted in 2006 against including women's ski jumping in 2010 because it deemed there weren't enough high-level women to create competition worthy of the Olympics. Because the IOC isn't bound by Canadian law, the judge ruled, Canada is powerless to change the program.

So the jumpers' appeal asks Canada to refuse to hold the men's event unless both genders can compete.

When the appeal is heard Nov. 12 and 13, it will highlight not just women's battle to wipe out the last vestige of an old-boys-club Olympic culture, but also competing demands on the Olympic ideal:

A member of the seven-strong Backbench Business Committee burst out laughing at the suggestion that MPs should be allowed to debate a range of gender issues including domestic violence, suicide and premature mortality rates.

In an age when offending the sensibilities of anti-sexism campaigners can cause Nobel laureates to be sacked and drive astrophysicists with unfortunate dress sense to tears of redemption, it’s a miracle there hasn’t been another hysterical lynching in the court of public opinion.

At least it would be if it were a male politician caught on camera chortling at the suggestion that parliament should discuss issues like violence against women, breast cancer screening and eating disorders.

The reason the media hasn’t grabbed hold of SniggerGate yet, is that the sniggering MP is female and the gendered problems she appears to find funny are issues that disproportionately affect men and boys.

(You can watch the debate in full on Parliamentlive.tv's archive. Fast forward to 14:54:10.)

On the day that Jess Phillips MP sniggered at the suggestion that men’s issues should be discussed in Parliament on International Men’s Day, another 13 men died from suicide.

It’s not funny. Not for the men whose lives were lost and not for their friends and family. Suicide is a men’s issue and if we don’t talk about the problem, we can’t solve it.

On the day the Labour member for Birmingham Yardley clapped her hands over her mouth to stop herself guffawing at Philip Davies MP’s request for a debate on men’s issues, more than 200 men died of cancer.

As a nation we spend more time, money and energy trying to prevent, detect and cure female cancers in the UK – and yet men are 58pc more likely to die of cancer before the age of 65 than women.

I don’t think that’s hilarious. Not for the men who die before their time and not for the loved ones they leave behind. Men of all classes have a lower life expectancy than women of the same background. It’s a men’s issue and like all men’s issues, we can’t solve it if we don’t discuss it.

NBER Working Paper No. 23735

Issued in August 2017

NBER Program(s):Economics of Education, Labor Studies

Recent work suggests that women are more responsive to negative feedback than men in certain environments. We examine whether negative feedback in the form of relatively low grades in major-related classes explains gender differences in the final majors undergraduates choose. We use unique administrative data from a large private university on the East Coast from 2009-2016 to test whether women are more sensitive to grades than men, and whether the gender composition of major-related classes affects major changes. We also control for other factors that may affect a student's final major including: high school student performance, gender of faculty, and economic returns of majors. Finally, we examine how students' decisions are affected by external cues that signal STEM fields as masculine. The results show that high school academic preparation, faculty gender composition, and major returns have little effect on major switching behaviors, and that women and men are equally likely to change their major in response to poor grades in major-related courses. Moreover, women in male-dominated majors do not exhibit different patterns of switching behaviors relative to their male colleagues. Women are, however, more likely to switch out of male-dominated STEM majors in response to poor performance compared to men. Therefore, we find that it takes multiple signals of lack of fit into a major (low grades, gender composition of class, and external stereotyping signals) to impel female students to switch majors.

<|begin_of_text|>Next month, yet another version of Charlotte Bronte’s novel Jane Eyre will be adapted for the screen, this time as a major motion picture by director Cary Fukunaga. While there have already been many film and TV versions of the book, Fukunaga’s take promises a sharp departure from the mild, romantic presentations of the past, taking on a much darker and menacing tone. (Watch the trailer.)

This new look at Jane Eyre has got me wondering about the appeal the novel has today. The classic is often construed as a girls’ novel, the mother of the romance genre. As I remember it, girls usually choose it in school, while boys preferred something more brash, like Hemingway’s A Farewell to Arms. It’s often organized as “women’s fiction” (a bizarre and seemingly arbitrary term that apparently includes both Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird, and Snooki’s A Shore Thing).

I’ll admit, I’ve avoided Jane Eyre, as well as Pride and Prejudice and other similarly categorized novels, based purely on the way they’ve been marketed to the genders. Because I’m a guy, it never seemed like these books were for me to read. But I now find myself anticipating the new Jane Eyre film, which will star Mia Wasikowska and Dame Judi Dench. It actually makes the book look, well, cool.

If Fukunaga’s adaptation of Jane Eyre brings out the strength in Jane’s character, it also seems like it will appeal to more men. It appears to tell the tale in a more traditionally masculine way: the trailer conveys a sense of imminent danger, spiritual conflict, and brooding mystery. Perhaps it will inspire more men to pick up the zombie-free version of the novel. I’ll be among them.

In the wake of Jane Slayer, which re-imagines Jane as a zombie-slaying heroine (part of a trend that also includes Pride and Prejudice and Zombies), people are beginning to recognize Bronte’s gothic influences. The story of Jane Eyre, it turns out, is a complicated and nuanced tale not merely of love gone bad. At its core is a story about character, morality, and independence.

The movie also appears to emphasize Jane as a heroine—an essential part of the story, and a designation Jane doesn’t often receive. There has been some recent debate over this: last week,

Rod Meade Sperry: You are the president of the Buddhist Recovery Network. What is the BRN’s role?

Valerie Mason-John: The BRN was started so people involved in different Buddhist-inspired recovery programs could pool ideas and work together. I think its role is to popularize Buddhist recovery so people see it as a mainstream complement— or alternative —to programs like 12-step recovery. I’m in touch with some recovery houses and they say the Buddhist-inspired approach is great. They want to know about alternatives, because not everybody wants to do 12 steps.

One of the things the Buddhist Recovery Network emphasizes is the need for more diversity in the recovery movement.

I’ve been in recovery for a long while. Many years ago, when I went along to help at meetings, I was freaked out because it was just practically all men and practically all white. It didn’t reflect me at all. I was at a recovery conference and there was only one other person there of African descent! Yet we know that the war on drugs in the United States has often been a war on Black people, a war on Hispanic people.

Even in the Buddhist recovery community, it has been dominantly male and there’s a real gap as far as women and people of color are concerned. We teach Buddhism through the lens of the Western gaze, unless you came from an Asian–American community. Buddhism was brought to the West by the Sharon Salzbergs, the Jack Kornfields, people like that. They brought it here, which was brilliant, but it’s seen through that Western gaze. But it’s not so accessible to certain people or communities.

Do you have to be Buddhist to do Buddhist recovery?

No. We’re using the teachings to help people with recovery. We do use Buddhist principles like the five precepts, which are recited at the meeting. But Buddhist recovery can be helpful to someone who’s a Christian, who’s a Hindu, who’s a Muslim.

What makes the Buddhist-based approach to recovery different from the 12-step program or other forms of recovery?

Twelve steps comes out of the Christian community and Buddhist recovery is based on the Buddhist teachings, which are all about coming out of suffering. In a way, it’s interesting we call it Buddhist recovery, because we could say that the whole path of dharma is about recovery, whether you’re an addict

<|begin_of_text|>Emergent attitudes toward brilliance The distribution of women and men across academic disciplines seems to be affected by perceptions of intellectual brilliance. Bian et al. studied young children to assess when those differential perceptions emerge. At age 5, children seemed not to differentiate between boys and girls in expectations of “really, really smart”—childhood's version of adult brilliance. But by age 6, girls were prepared to lump more boys into the “really, really smart” category and to steer themselves away from games intended for the “really, really smart.” Science, this issue p. 389

Abstract Common stereotypes associate high-level intellectual ability (brilliance, genius, etc.) with men more than women. These stereotypes discourage women’s pursuit of many prestigious careers; that is, women are underrepresented in fields whose members cherish brilliance (such as physics and philosophy). Here we show that these stereotypes are endorsed by, and influence the interests of, children as young as 6. Specifically, 6-year-old girls are less likely than boys to believe that members of their gender are “really, really smart.” Also at age 6, girls begin to avoid activities said to be for children who are “really, really smart.” These findings suggest that gendered notions of brilliance are acquired early and have an immediate effect on children’s interests.

The career aspirations of young men and women are shaped by societal stereotypes about gender (1, 2). For example, the stereotype that men are better than women at mathematics (3) impairs women’s performance in this domain (4, 5) and undermines their interest in mathematics-intensive fields (6, 7). However, popular beliefs about ability associate not only specific cognitive processes (e.g., mathematical reasoning) with a particular gender but also the overall amount of cognitive ability. It is commonly assumed that high-level cognitive ability (brilliance, genius, giftedness, etc.) is present more often in men than in women (8–11). This “brilliance = males” stereotype has been invoked to explain the gender gaps in many prestigious occupations (12–15). However, little is known about the acquisition of this stereotype. The earlier children acquire the notion that brilliance is a male quality, the stronger its influence may be on their aspirations. The four studies reported here (N = 400 children) show that, by the age of 6, girls are less likely than boys to believe that members of their gender are “really, really smart”—a child-friendly way of referring to brilliance.

"Stop interrupting me."

"I just said that."

"No explanation needed."

In fifth grade, I won the school courtesy prize. In other words, I won an award for being polite. My brother, on the other hand, was considered the class comedian. We were very typically socialized as a "young lady" and a "boy being a boy." Globally, childhood politeness lessons are gender asymmetrical. We socialize girls to take turns, listen more carefully, not curse and resist interrupting in ways we do not expect boys to. Put another way, we generally teach girls subservient habits and boys to exercise dominance.

I routinely find myself in mixed-gender environments (life) where men interrupt me. Now that I've decided to try and keep track, just out of curiosity, it's quite amazing how often it happens. It's particularly pronounced when other men are around.

This irksome reality goes along with another -- men who make no eye contact. For example, a waiter who only directs information and questions to men at a table, or the man last week who simply pretended I wasn't part of a circle of five people (I was the only woman). We'd never met before and barely exchanged 10 words, so it couldn't have been my not-so-shrinking-violet opinions.

These two ways of establishing dominance in conversation, frequently based on gender, go hand-in-hand with this last one: A woman, speaking clearly and out loud, can say something that no one appears to hear, only to have a man repeat it minutes, maybe seconds later, to accolades and group discussion.

After I wrote about the gender confidence gap recently, of the 10 items on a list, the one that resonated the most was the issue of whose speech is considered important. In sympathetic response to what I wrote, a person on Twitter sent me a cartoon in which one woman and five men sit around a conference table. The caption reads, "That's an excellent suggestion, Miss Triggs. Perhaps one of the men here would like to make it." I don't think there is a woman alive who has not had this happen.

The cartoon may seem funny, until you realize exactly how often it seriously happens. And -- as in the cases of Elizabeth Warren or say, Brooksley Born -- how broadly consequential the impact can be. When you add race and class to the equation the incidence of this marginalization is even higher.

It's no longer "a guy thing". Growing up I often heard "What, you play video games?!

Updated about 2 hours ago Fri 6 Nov 2015, 1:04am

Computing never used to be seen as a masculine pursuit, but since the 80s we have witnessed a fascinating recalibration of tech and gender, as the beta males became alpha, writes Jeff Sparrow.

The first 'computers' had names. They were Kay McNulty, Marlyn Wescoff, Fran Bilas, Ruth Lichterman, Adele Goldstine and Betty Snyder.

In the 1940s, these women programmed the US Army's Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer (ENIAC), known to the press at the time as "the giant brain" and recognised today as the first electronic general-purpose computer.

ENIAC's operators were chosen from the clerks - known as 'computers' - who had previously been working out ballistic tables with desk calculators. Most were women, and because the job entailed crawling within ENIAC to manipulate its switches and cables, they came to understand the machine better than anyone.

That's just one example of the important role women played in pioneering today's high technology.

Famously, the very first piece of computer programming was performed by Ada Lovelace, who, in the 1840s, wrote an algorithm designed to be employed by Charles Babbage's "difference engine". Grace Hopper came up with the first computer compiler in 1952 and then established the programming language COBOL. Mary Keller helped develop BASIC; Radia Perlman built some of the protocols of the early internet.

As Brendan Keogh explains in his fascinating essay about the development of computer gaming, many of these advances took place in male-dominated institutions such as military facilities and engineering laboratories. Nevertheless, during the postwar decades, the proportion of women studying computer science was growing rapidly, faster than in any professional fields.

And then something happened.

In a piece for NPR, Steve Henn notes that the participation rates for women in computer science began to fall in the mid-80s: that is, at about the same time as personal computers entered the home.

At first, the association seems completely counter-intuitive. You'd think home access to computing would increase gender parity.

But as Henn says:

These early personal computers weren't much more than toys. You could play pong or simple shooting games, maybe do some word processing. And these toys were marketed almost entirely to men and boys. This idea that computers

<|begin_of_text|>WASHINGTON — Several Democratic members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) agreed Thursday that racism is behind African Americans serving prison sentences at a disproportionate rate, but none of them thought systemic sexism was a factor in men being over 90 percent of federal prisoners.

The disparity between men and women is much larger then the one between whites and blacks when it comes to criminal justice. In 2011, black people in America were 2.5 times more likely to be stopped on the street by the police than white folk. That same year, men were 8.3 times to face a street stop then women.

Likewise, the disparity between men and women serving sentences in state and federal penitentiaries was much larger than it was for black people and white people in 2011. That year, African Americans were 5.8 times more likely than whites to be in a federal or state prison and men were 15.8 times more likely to be those same prisons than women.

The Daily Caller spoke to five Democratic CBC members who believed that a racist system was to blame for the disparity between whites and blacks in the justice system. When asked about how sexism could then play a role in that same system, they gave various different answers. None agreed with the premise that “systemic sexism” could be at play.

Congressional Black Caucus chairman Rep. G.K. Butterfield said, “I’m not going to say that men commit crimes at a higher frequency then women because I don’t know that to be true. I don’t really know the answer to it.”

Two other lawmakers — Texas Democratic Rep. Marc Veasey and Mississippi Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson — refused to entertain the question. New York Democratic Rep. Charlie Rangel and Washington, D.C Democratic Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton believed that men and women had distinct differences leading to the different crime statistics.

“Men and women aren’t comparable groups to compare when it comes to crime,” Norton told TheDC. She described differences between men and women as being “old as the millennia.”

Rangel was more direct and suggested men are genetically predisposed to violence.

“Men generally, which has nothing to do with racism, have a tendency to be disorderly more than women, that goes without saying. There’s more goddamn [male] prizefighters than women,” Rangel said. He added, “Men are built differently, men play football, they’re boxers, they do things that require strength, they’re more disorderly, they get into more trouble.”

Before Magpie went live on Product Hunt, everyone told us that Product Hunt was not necessarily the best place for us, since our product is developed exclusively for the use of female users and most Product Hunters are men. Just for some context about what Magpie does — we’re a female travelers club, designed to help women easily find local friends sharing common interests, wherever they go.

The companies featured on Product Hunt are mostly started by men, and female hunters and makers are in the minority. But that did not deter us from giving it a try. Throughout the day, we watched in awe as the support came streaming in. Starting the day at the bottom, we steadily climbed to where we ended the day, solidly in the top 3 and with the highest number of upvotes and comments.

It’s never too late to vote for us, by the way, if you’d like to share us some love :-) We ended the day with over 600 upvotes as supporters continued to vote for us all over the world. We also saw very encouraging results: our sign-ups increased 20 times, and our site traffic increased 10 times. We also received a lot of press interview requests, partnership opportunities, and insightful user feedback. One fun fact: almost half of our upvotes came from women, making us probably the most upvoted product by PH women voters, woohoo!!!

We had so much fun on Product Hunt on the auspicious Mag(Pi)e day ;-) and would love to share what we learn in case helpful to other startups going to launch on Product Hunt.

Though we ended the day with the highest number of upvotes (over 500!) and comments, we still ranked second on the site. We found out that this was due to Product Hunt’s intriguing ranking methods that take in factors like organic search and how active your voters are on Product Hunt.

He says violence toward women affects men, too. Yet culture ignores, propagates it

He says campaign "One million men. One million promises," to draw attention to it

McPherson: Men can help in many small ways. Set example in treatment of women

Dallas Cowboys tight end Jason Witten is the 2012 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year. Why? In large part because of Witten's tireless commitment to ending domestic violence. As a former professional football player and longtime domestic violence prevention advocate, I understand how gratifying it is to receive this honor from the NFL. For the men engaged in this critical issue, it can be a lonely road.

But now Witten has company in Dallas. Moved to action by a series of recent slayings, Mayor Mike Rawlings announced the launch of a citywide awareness campaign to show that domestic violence — and the culture that ignores or perpetuates it — has no home in his city. He's hoping at least 10,000 men show up to rally with that message on Dallas' City Hall Plaza later this month.

A drive to end domestic violence, led by men. It's an idea whose time has come, again and again; some men have been pushing it for decades. But now many are hearing the call.

As Rawlings said in a recent press conference: "In the past this has been viewed as a women's issue, but it ain't. It's our problem." The problem is not confined to a shocking spate of killings in Dallas, or to one major U.S. city. The New York Police Department reportedly receives 700 domestic violence calls every day. Domestic violence costs the United States more than $9 billion a year. More than 603 million women live in countries where domestic violence is not a crime. Globally, at least one in three women and girls are beaten or sexually abused in their lifetimes, usually at the hands of men.

What can men do?

Men do not just need to stop being violent. The vast majority of men are not violent. But men do need to stop being silent. Calling violence against women, whether street harassment or sexual harassment or rape or murder, a "women's issue" allows men to ignore it as if we have no responsibility for it or stake in ending it.

Young female students in the Indian capital, Delhi, are fighting to assert their right to public spaces with a campaign called Pinjra Tod (Break The Cage). The BBC's Geeta Pandey joins them for a night as they go out to "claim the streets" and fill them with their "dreams and desires".

Just as night falls, about 60 young women and men begin marching through some of Delhi university's premier colleges.

Many are carrying posters, they shout slogans, halt outside women's hostels, recite poems and break out into impromptu dances.

"We don't need no false protection, you can't cage half the nation," they sing.

One young man plays a drum hanging around his neck, while a woman wearing a red sari gives a lively speech.

Image caption We are saying this is not about women's safety really, this is about moral policing"

At regular intervals, the participants - Delhi university students past and present - whistle and clap in approval or chant "shame, shame".

The issue that has brought all these men and women out on to the streets is what is called the "curfew hour" in women's hostels - the deadline by which residents must return to their rooms.

"It is discriminatory," says Devangana Kalita, a 26-year-old researcher and co-founder of the Pinjra Tod movement.

"Curfews and deadlines in the name of providing protection and safety are actually mechanisms of reproducing patriarchy. We are saying this is not about women's safety really, this is about moral policing."

Image caption Protesters say the march to claim the streets by female students is "unprecedented" and "historic".

Students say most women's hostels - whether run by the university or privately-owned - follow curfew hours. Some lock their gates as early as 6:30pm or 7:30pm while a few allow students to remain out until a little later.

They say while curfew times are stringently enforced in women's hostels and those who break them run the risk of being expelled, hostels for men, which also have curfew hours on paper, rarely enforce them.

Libraries and laboratories in the university are open until much later - till midnight or in some places, even until 2am - and curfew hours mean women have no access to them.

<|begin_of_text|>Pakistan is preparing for its first census in 19 years. Here are some facts about the upcoming enumeration exercise of the sixth most populous nation in the world.

Read: All set for country’s biggest census exercise

A third sex

For the first time, transsexual people will be counted separately, according to representatives of this historically recognised but often persecuted community in the country.

The forms had been printed well in advance of court decisions to include them in the count. Now enumerators have been informed that those surveyed will have three numeric choices for their gender: 1 for men, 2 for women, 3 for those who declare themselves transsexuals.

Only nine languages

Language is considered an essential tool in evaluating the makeup of multi-ethnic Pakistan — but only nine of the country's estimated 70 will be listed, to the dismay of many communities.

No regional languages from sparsely populated Gilgit-Baltistan will be included nor will Gujrati — spoken by some Muslim immigrants from India who believe the lack of recognition will drive their mother-tongue towards oblivion.

Examine: The future of Gujarati language in Pakistan

Faith matters

The census will provide an insight into the true number of religious minorities, especially Christians and Hindus. Estimates are approximate and disputed, ranging from 2 to 10 million for the former and 2.5 to 4.5m for the latter.

Citizens can declare themselves Muslim, Christian, Hindu or Ahmadi.

Otherwise, they can be “members of scheduled castes” — members of marginalised Hindu families, or “other”. There are no separate options for Sikhs, Parsis or Baha'i.

Feeling flush

One box asks households how many toilets they have — a particularly salient question in Pakistan, where the United Nations estimates up to 40 per cent of people defecate in the open air with dramatic health consequences, especially for children.

Nationality

The census gives two nationality options: Pakistani or foreign.

But the army, which will conduct a parallel count, plans to be more precise mainly because of the country's Afghan refugees who are accused of everything from terrorism to trafficking.

Many local officials fear Afghans could be counted as local and skew demography in favour of ethnic Pashtuns, whose political parties would benefit as a result.

On the other hand, the estimated six million Pakistanis working abroad will not be counted. No information will be collected on internal migration — necessary to assess the political weight of a province where many people

Elizabeth Drumm, the head of the programme, made some introductory remarks, her voice quavering. As some faculty members moved to take their places at a panel discussion, three demonstrators emerged from the wings of the auditorium. “We’re protesting Hum 110 because it’s Eurocentric,” one began. “I’m sorry, this is a classroom space and this is not appropriate,” Ms Drumm said, immediately cancelling the lecture. Thus began another academic year at Reed College, a liberal arts college in Portland, Oregon.

Last academic year, a dozen or so students continuously occupied the three-day-a-week lecture series by sitting in front of the auditorium with cardboard signs, sometimes taping their mouths in protest at the absence of non-white voices in the syllabus. One even took to lecturing the freshman class on the podium from an alternate curriculum before the start of each session. But this year, the college’s president sent out an e-mail outlining the school’s dissent policy 16 minutes before the lecture began, warning that the administration would act against potential violations. Reed College students were ranked as the most liberal and the second most studious in Princeton Review’s survey of its top 382 liberal arts colleges. That compound of leftist politics and serious scholarship proved unstable last year as activists managed to cow the college’s administration, students and faculty alike.

The protesters argue that the Humanities programme is racist because it ignores many of the world’s great civilisations and because its authors are overwhelmingly male and white. They point out that black students represent less than 3% of the school’s 1,400 students and argue that the administration has not done enough to support them. A good portion of the student body appear to support their goals and tactics.

Assistant professor Lucia Martinez Valdivia, who describes herself as mixed-race and queer, asked protesters not to demonstrate during her lecture on Sappho last November. Ms Valdivia said she suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and doubted her ability to deliver the lecture in the face of their opposition. At first, demonstrators announced they would change tactics and sit quietly in the audience, wearing black. After her speech, a number of them berated her, bringing her to tears.

Despite representing a tiny percentage of Americans, white males from the Lone Star state will occupy six of the 21 committee chairmanships. Not bad, considering white Texan men account for only 3.35% of the U.S. population.

The half dozen committee chairmanships will also represent the largest number for a state delegation since at least 1979, according to The New York Times.

The six Texas chairmen will be K. Michael Conaway (Agriculture), Mac Thornberry (Armed Services), Jeb Hensarling (Financial Services), Michael McCaul (Homeland Security), Pete Sessions (Rules), and Lamar Smith (Science, Space and Technology).

Four of them—Hensarling, McCaul, Sessions and Smith—were chairmen of their committees during the last Congress.

“The six committees that will be run by Texans starting in January all have sway over large federal programs and commercial interests, and over the operation of the House itself,” the Times’ Derek Willis wrote. “The Rules Committee is essentially an arm of the leadership; it determines the rules of debate for legislation on the House floor.”

But Texas won’t have as much sway in the House as it once did. “The Republicans having six committee chairs is certainly unprecedented, but it probably won’t mean that the Texas delegation is as powerful as it was when it had the majority leader and majority whip,” Sean M. Theriault, a professor in the Department of Government at the University of Texas, referring to the years 1995-2003, said in an email to the Times.

BAMAKO, Mali — In a country where two-thirds of the adults are illiterate, it is a privileged few who have the chance to study at the Mustafa International School.

Located in the western suburbs of Bamako, a few blocks from the U.S. Embassy, the college-level seminary has just 180 students — 150 men and 30 women. They engage in an intensive curriculum that encompasses theology, history, philosophy, Arabic, Farsi, and world religions. They work in the school’s computer suite, equipped with 12 desktop computers, and get three meals a day at the seminary’s expense. And they do it all under the watchful eyes of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, former supreme leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, whose likeness gazes down on them from his portrait, which hangs above the bookshelves of the school’s library.

These young students are part of Mali’s tiny Shiite community: a group of about 10,000 families nationally, in a country where the Sunni majority makes up an estimated 95 percent of the population of 15 million.

They’re also the stuff of Saudi nightmares.

Historically, West Africa has had a tolerant approach to religious differences, shunning — at least until recently — the sort of Sunni-Shiite sectarian rivalries that have plagued the Middle East in favor of a patchwork of beliefs that incorporate Sufism, Maliki Islam, and traditional animist practices. But Mali — home to seminaries with ties to Iran, like the Mustafa International School, and where diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks this summer reveal that Saudi Arabia is scrambling to fund its own competing schools, mosques, and cultural projects — provides a case study in how the enmity between Sunni Islam and Shiite Islam may be being spread, via Iranian and Saudi proxies, to places thousands of miles from the Middle East.

Unlike most of Mali’s private schools and universities, which charge hefty fees, the Mustafa International School selects students from outside the capital and gives them free room and board. Few of the students hail from Mali’s elite families; rather, they are selected via tests administered to Shiite youth across the country. The highest achievers are offered the chance to continue their study in Iran.

The school is able to afford such generous support for its students because it is backed by an Iranian university in Qom, a city considered holy by Shiite Muslims and famed for its Islamic learning. The state-run University of

Allie Rubin Blocked Unblock Follow Following Jun 13, 2015

Nobel Prize winner Sir Tim Hunt recently caused a stir when he argued that male and female scientists should work independently, because women are a distraction to men in the lab. At a conference, he was quoted as saying, “Let me tell you about my trouble with girls… three things happen when they are in the lab… You fall in love with them, they fall in love with you and when you criticize them, they cry.”

As improbable as it might sound, I am a female scientist, and I agree with Tim Hunt.

First of all, Sir Tim’s comments are based on his personal experiences, and are therefore incontrovertible. Three hundred and fifty years ago, Isaac Newton saw an apple fall and decided that gravity existed. Three weeks ago, Tim Hunt saw a woman cry and decided that all women are unfit to be scientists. Science is based on observations, which are the same thing as universal proof. Even I know that, and I’m just a woman whose brain is filled to capacity with yoga poses and recipes for gluten-free organic soap. Once, I was lured into a trap in the woods because I followed a trail of Sex and the City DVDs for three miles into a covered pit. Do you really think I could do something as complicated as thinking about science?

Second, Tim Hunt is correct in asserting that women are distracting to men in a lab setting, which greatly affects their productivity. Last month, my labmates and I had to burn our female coworker at the stake for witchcraft because we saw her holding an unwrapped tampon. Between building the stake, lighting an adequate fire, and waiting for her to die, we lost an entire day that we could otherwise have spent working. I make every effort to not distract my male colleagues; sometimes I have to work on my astrology charts from home when I’m menstruating or have leprosy, just so I can let the men in my lab focus on doing real science. It’s a small sacrifice I make that keeps morale in the lab way up.

Tim Hunt also mentions that men and women are constantly falling in love with each other within the lab. This is true; I used to identify as homosexual before working with a group of bearded men and a set of phallic pipettes turned me straight. Once that happened, I couldn’t stop falling in love with every man I met. One time I fell

He was a hero of the Men's Rights movement. Three years ago, Earl Silverman, a self-described long-term survivor of violence at the hands of an abusive wife, turned his own home into the Men's Alternative Safe House, Canada's first domestic abuse shelter for men and their children. On Friday, he was found hanging in its garage, an apparent suicide.

Silverman had been going through a period of intense personal stress lately – his death came just one day after he packed up his recently sold home. Just last month, he'd closed the shelter because he could no longer afford to maintain it. He had said he was struggling to keep up with his heat and grocery bills.

Advertisement:

In his dogged efforts to help men and to raise public awareness, Silverman worked to remove the stigma that can often prevent men from speaking out because of pride and fear and misunderstanding. Yet where Silverman came up short was in perpetuating the Men's Rights movement's fiction that there's any gender equity as far as violence and victims. The Calgary Herald recalled, in its coverage of his death, Silverman's oft-repeated insistence that "men are about as likely as women to say they have been the victims of domestic abuse."

Despite the jokey, knee-jerk assumption that male abuse either isn't real or is only reserved for the henpecked and weak, there is no question that female abusers exist. There are male victims. Whether we're talking about violence or sexual abuse, we need to understand that, and to treat men who have been the victims of abuse with respect and compassion.

Yet the truth isn't as tit-for-tat as Silverman made it out to be. The American Bar Association, for example, notes that the statistics bear out that "nearly 25 percent of women and 7.6 percent of men" have been raped and/or physically assaulted by a partner. Partner violence makes up roughly 20 percent of the violent crime against women, and 3 percent of it against men." These statistics don't distinguish partner gender. The ABA notes that "Most perpetrators of sexual violence are men" and that "Sexual violence against men is also mainly male violence." But tell that to Silverman's MRA fans, who are currently lamenting that he was a victim of "misandrist bullshit" and

Results show that certain aspects of neural development could affect a person’s risk for pedophilic tendencies.

"Evidence is steadily accumulating to support a neurodevelopmental basis of pedophilia," lead researcher Fiona Dyshniku said in a statement. "If we find that pedophilia has a biological basis, with a very early, even prenatal onset, this will influence and hopefully improve methods of treatment for this group.”

Dyshniku and her colleagues recruited 140 adult men referred to the Kurt Freund Laboratory of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, who were evaluated for certain physical anomalies and right or left handedness. Each participant was assessed for their distressing or illegal sexual behavior using a forensic and medical file review, an interview regarding sexual history, and phallometric testing for erotic preference.

Men from the study who researchers identified as pedophiles were more likely to have minor facial and head flaws compared to men who were not considered pedophiles. Men with facial and head deviations scored highest on indicators of pedophilia. These facial and head anomalies included non-detached earlobes, malformed ears, and a high or steepled palate.

Facial malformations tend to develop due to the same primary embryonic tissue layer that forms the central nervous system during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. These facial flaws, which are more prevalent among men, are usually caused by prenatal exposure to viruses, alcohol or drugs, obstetric complications, or nutritional deficiencies.

"If we know more about the etiology of an injurious behavior, we can create more effective treatments and look toward prevention," added Rachel Fazio, clinical neuropsychologist and co-author of the study. "For years, it was thought that child molestation was somewhat of a learned behavior, potentially from the abusers having been sexually abused themselves as children. While this may be a factor in some cases, this is not the case in those with genuine pedophilia."

Findings from the study also revealed that most pedophiles are left-handed, which is on par with similar studies in the past. Left- or right-handedness is decided very early in life and is a direct result of prenatal cognitive development. Between eight to 12 percent of the population

There's something about money and men.

Researchers have long shown a link between men's identities and their income: Men tend to work more hours if faced with the threat of their wife earning as much as they do. When men make less money than their wives, they tend to do less housework, not more. And when men are out-earned in their marriages, they're even more likely to use erectile dysfunction medicine or show greater rates of depression.

Now, a new study, currently under review by an academic journal but published last week by the Harvard Business Review, finds that when a man's contribution to his household's total income drops over time, it affects his political views, too. Republican men tend to grow more conservative, and guys who say they're Democrats become more liberal.

[America’s manliest industries are all competing for women]

To do the research, Dan Cassino wanted to look at the effect lower incomes have on men's political views, but knew that comparing men's relative income, marriages and politics is hard because of something known as “selection bias.” For example, it could simply be that different kinds of men marry women who earn more than them — in other words, there's no random application of people to spouses.

So he looked at the General Social Survey, a panel study that asks the same individuals about demographic data and views on issues over time, pulling data on 854 men from 2006, 2008 and 2010. About 60 percent of those men saw their income drop relative to their spouses during one of those two-year periods, giving Cassino a look at how men's views evolved during a period when, thanks to the recession and financial crisis, men were disproportionately likely to lose their jobs or take pay cuts, compared with women, who have increasingly become the family breadwinners.

“That's a huge opportunity to look at what happened to those men's individual attitudes,” he said. For men, in particular, income is tied to their gender identity and status. “The reason you're anxious about … less money is not just, 'oh, I have less money.' It's that my masculinity is being called into question by the fact that [I] make less money,” Cassino said.

This viewpoint is no surprise in light of research by psychologists Kate Ratliff of the University of Florida and Shigehiro Oishi of the University of Virginia reported in a recent issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. In one experiment conducted with 32 male/female dating couples, the participants were given a test they were told measured their intelligence. The test was not graded, but each participant was informed that his or her partner scored in either the top 12% or bottom 12%. The men who had been told they had high-scoring partners measured lower on a self-esteem test than the men who thought their female partners scored low.

Other studies have also shown that men often regard their female partners’ success as a reflection on them; if she succeeds more, it means he has failed. Women, on the other hand, are more likely to see the man’s success as good for the relationship overall.[/pullquote]In another experiment with 122 men and women who were involved in heterosexual relationships but weren’t couples, the males scored higher on a measure of self-esteem when recalling a time when their partner had failed at an intellectual or social endeavor. The result was quite different for women. “Unlike men, even when women were explicitly asked to think of [a] time when their partner succeeded and they themselves failed, their implicit self-esteem was not decreased,” stated the researchers.

Other studies have also shown that men often regard their female partners’ success as a reflection on them; if she succeeds more, it means he has failed. Women, on the other hand, are more likely to see the man’s success as good for the relationship overall. They also tend to view their own success in terms of its value for the relationship, rather than just being about “me.” These differences in perspective are not surprising, considering traditional gender roles. “Because men and women have different social roles, different expectations for their close relationships, and different responses to competition, it is likely that men and women’s self-esteem is differentially impacted by a romantic partner’s success or failure,” Drs. Ratliff and Oishi wrote in their published report.

One explanation for men’s reaction is that they fear their mate might seek out a more appealing man, according to Mark White, Ph.D., chair of the philosophy department at the College of Staten Island/CUNY. “[The man’s

<|begin_of_text|>For more than three decades evolutionary psychologists have advanced a simple theory of human sexuality: because men invest less reproductive effort in sperm than women do in eggs, men's and women's brains have been shaped differently by evolution. As a result, men are eager for sex whereas women are relatively choosy. But a steady stream of recent evidence suggests this paradigm could be in need of a makeover.

"The science is now getting to a point where there is good data to question some of the assumptions of evolutionary psychology," says social psychologist Wendy Wood of the University of Southern California (U.S.C.).

The eager males–choosy females paradigm doesn't imply that men and women literally make conscious decisions about how much effort they should put into short- and long-term mating relative to their costs of reproduction—minutes versus months. Instead the idea is that during human history, men and women who happened to have the right biochemical makeup to be easy and choosy, respectively, would leave more offspring than their counterparts.

In 1993 psychologists David Buss and David Schmitt, then at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, used that idea to generate a series of predictions about men's and women's sexual behavior. As part of their study, Buss and Schmitt surveyed college students about their desire for short- and long-term mates (that is, one-night stands versus marriage partners), their ideal number of mates, how long they would have to know someone before being willing to have sex, and what standards a one-night stand would have to meet. In all categories the men opted for more sex than the women.

Although the study has been cited some 1,200 times, according to Google Scholar, there were "huge gaps from what I'm used to as a scientist," says Lynn Carol Miller of U.S.C. Miller says that in order to evaluate the relative proportion of mating effort devoted to short- and long-term mating in the two sexes, the proper method is to use a scale such as time or money, which has the same interval between units, not the seven-point rating scale that Buss and Schmitt used.

In a study to be published in the journal Sex Roles: A Journal of Research, Miller and her colleagues carried out their own version of Buss and Schmitt's work, asking how much time and money college students spent in a typical week pursuing short-, intermediate- or long-term relationships. The proportion of mating effort dedicated to short-term mating was the same for men and women. Similarly, both men and women showed an equivalent tendency to lower

The Wolf Conservation Center‘s youngest Ambassador has been an inspiration from his adorable start. Within a month of joining the WCC family the little beast huffed, puffed, and hiccuped his way into the hearts and minds of a global audience. His viral video “Wolf Pup Hiccups” almost broke the internet!

Today the stunning ambassador continues to awe and help open the door to understanding wolves by forging a connection between the public and his wild kin. Although he remains a “ladies man,” having yet to completely outgrow his uneasiness around men, his trepidation is natural and his behavior offers WCC guests a glimpse of how elusive wolves naturally are.

Physically Nikai is no longer the baby of the family; he has become equal in stature to older siblings Alawa and Zephyr. He does, however, remain the “child” within the family hierarchy. Zephyr is the self-appointed leader of the family – expressing his status with erect posture and tail carried high. Most of the time Nikai exhibits his lower position through submissive/puppy-like behavior. With lowered tail and posture, he acknowledges his role and rank in the family order. He is often pawing, tucking his tail, and licking the muzzles of his siblings – some of the natural submissive gestures expressed by less dominant wolves. However, during the winter months Nikai did test Zephyr. He incessantly egged on his older brother until the two had it out while Alawa wisely steered clear of the mayhem. Thankfully it took only a few bumps and scratches to return peace and order to the pack with Zephyr at the helm once again.

So a new chapter opens for our Ambassador trio. And what an honor to watch the family transition into such powerful players in the fight to preserve wolves’ rightful place in the environment.

Help support the Wolf Conservation Center‘s efforts to protect and preserve wolf populations in North America by adopting the birthday boy! We offer several adoption levels. No matter what the level, each adoption kit includes an 8×10 wolf photo, wolf biography, adoption certificate and a subscription to our newsletter. Learn more.

Three whole decades passed from its 1971 release and no one bested it, not even Guns N' Roses' "November Rain" or Journey's "Don't Stop Believing" or, uh, Live's "Lightning Crashes." It was only in the 2000s that rock bands got their shit together and produced several candidates that lived up to "Stairway." But like the Highlander, there can be only one. Friends, today we're going to discover which of these 00s alt-rock slammers is the millennial successor to this classic rock not-slammer (the live versions are the true gospel).

Now, it's not like we're in an anthem-deficient time in music. The new lighter-wavers are just rap and trap and pop singles, which is great! But the nature of, say, "Black Beatles" is wholly different from a "Stairway" or its imitators, the likes of which we may never see again. These largely straight and white men made these songs because they wanted you to feel their very important feelings, dammit, and they were going to use all the tools in the arsenal of rock to do so. There's a pure, innocent beauty in that kind of obliviousness, and it's that magic we're trying to remember and tediously rank today. Seeing as how sports and competition are the basis of everything now, we're going to do this as a bracket tournament.

So you may ask yourself, "what makes a song a 'Stairway'"? That's a great question, so let's define what a "Stairway" is.

A "Stairway to Heaven" is...

1. Almost always a rock song, typically a ballad

2. Recognizable within the first few seconds

3. Already emotional from the jump, but eventually reaches a point that has all living things weeping openly

While there are definitely many giant, cathartic rock songs from the last decade, very few of them are actually known by regular people, and that ubiquity is what's really needed (i.e. "All My Friends" and other indie classics are not eligible). And yes, this will pool from songs released mainly in the last decade, as this gives the minimum amount of time for nostalgia to ferment into uncritical adoration. Cool? Cool. Let's

COOK COUNTY CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE — A UIC freshman with a four-year swimming scholarship has been charged with illegally filming female teammates as they changed clothes in their locker room.

Joseph Dalesandro, 19, was ordered held on $50,000 bail Friday on allegations he filmed four women with an iPhone over the course of several hours Feb. 2.

According to prosecutors, locker rooms for men and women on the UIC swimming and diving teams are separated by a partition wall that has a gap between the top of the wall and the ceiling for a smoke detector.

Dalesandro is accused of perching his iPhone on the wall about 11 a.m. Feb. 2 and recording two women on the diving team, ages 19 and 20, as they changed clothes.

Dalesandro filmed the women for three minutes, prosecutors said, but later cropped the video to feature one minute of nudity.

About two hours later, Dalesandro filmed the women's locker room for 45 minutes — this time capturing two swimmers, ages 19 and 20, as they changed clothes, Assistant State's Attorney Joseph Carlson said during a bond hearing Friday.

One of the women heard laughter coming from the men's locker room and looked up, expecting the men to throw something over the wall, prosecutors said.

Instead, she spotted Dalesandro's phone, Carlson said. Two of the women retrieved the phone and brought it to their coach, who called campus police.

During the course of their investigation, officers learned the phone was registered to Dalesandro and his mother, prosecutors said. Dalesandro was one of five men who had access to the locker room at the time of filming; his phone was also logged into the UIC wireless network with his username when the videos were made.

Police on Thursday arrested Dalesandro, who lives on campus and comes from Naperville. He confessed to making the videos and "stated he knew what he had done was illegal," Carlson said.

In court Friday, Assistant Public Defender Marc Davidson noted that the videos Dalesandro recorded were never disseminated, and that Dalesandro has no prior criminal history.

"This was a prank," Davidson said. "A tasteless prank that went nowhere.... This will cost him dearly over the years."

Meanwhile, nearly two-thirds of Twitter is staffed by whites. Asians are also dominant, accounting for 29 percent of employees.

This matches a lot of what we've seen at other companies lately, from Google to Yahoo to Facebook to LinkedIn. The reports all speak clearly and transparently about the need to become more inclusive — not just when it comes to gender, but also to race. At Google, for instance, only 2 percent of employees are black and 3 percent Hispanic.

There is a another story in the data that's less apparent, though, and it's about class. We don't typically talk about class as it relates to tech companies, because tech tends to be a lucrative field in its own right and engineers make a lot of money. If anything, tech employees have borne the brunt of the criticism in connection with San Francisco's skyrocketing housing prices, or the exclusive corporate shuttle buses that wind their way through the city during rush hour.

Still, the data show that there's a big gap between the executives at the top of the pyramid and those who actually make the machines go.

This is true for Twitter, but also at Yahoo, where women account for 37 percent of the workforce but only 23 percent of leadership positions. Whites make up only 50 percent of Yahoo's U.S. employees, but as much as 78 percent of its U.S.-based leadership.

Asians make up more than a third of Facebook's overall workforce. Yet only 19 percent have made it into senior-level positions.

There appears to be a ceiling at many of these companies that transcends demography — though it's important to point out that some groups in leadership do match their level of representation in the rest of the company. Blacks account for 2 percent of Twitter's employees, and they also account for 2 percent of Twitter's leadership. Hispanics account for 4 percent of leadership employees at Facebook, and also 4 percent of the company's overall workforce.

Why should we care whether the top level leadership looks like the rest of the company? For the same reasons that people care about a company's diversity overall: Different experiences and value systems help counter groupthink.

All-male speaker lineups are so commonplace that there’s at least one Tumblr blog dedicated to mocking them (with a David Hasselhoff meme, no less). The endless stream of them can leave a thinking person overwhelmed and perhaps even convinced that they’re inevitable.

If you find yourself in this camp, help is on the way. Enter mathematician Greg Martin, who has presented an ingenious statistical probability analysis that even amateurs like me can(well, mostly) understand. Working with a “conservative” assumption that 24% of PhDs in mathematics have been granted to women over the last 25 years, he finds that it’s overwhelmingly improbable that a speakers’ lineup including one woman and 19 men could be random.

His explanation of the formula is a rollicking one involving marbles and a potentially suspicious roommate, and you which you can read here. The underrepresentation of women on speakers’ lists doesn’t “just happen,” despite many conference organizers’ claim that it does.

If you do the math, as Martin has, the argument that speakers are chosen without bias simply doesn’t hold up. In fact, when using the formula to analyze the speakers’ list for a mathematics conference—which featured just one woman and 19 men—he found that it would be eighteen times as likely for women to be overrepresented on the speakers’ list than to be so underrepresented.

The formula can just as easily be applied to other fields; all that’s needed is reliable data on the field’s gender distribution, which can usually be gathered by way of industry associations and/or government statistics (pdf).

I spoke with Martin about his analysis, its implications and whether it might finally convince conference organizers to stop making excuses for their underrepresentation of women.

What prompted you to calculate the statistical probability of all-male speakers’ lists?

While I’d love to claim it was my idea originally, that’s not the case—I came across a Conference Diversity Distribution Calculator by Aanand Prasad on the web. Prasad further credits inspiration for the idea to comments by Dave Wilkinson and Paul Battley.

As a side note, following Prasad’s links to those comments leads to two web pages—this one and this one—concerning tech conferences within the last three years that were criticized for inviting men almost exclusively; reading the rest of those comment threads reveals how truly dismissive and defensive people get when gender disparity is pointed out. Sadly, we still have a long way to go.

The lanky teenager shuffled into the vestibule wearing a short white crop top, exposing his taut midriff. Blots of black skin poked through hand-tattered jeans that were so tight he had to cut them up and safety-pin them back together to get them on. Shayne's outfit set him drastically apart from the men of the congregation, who wore boxy suits. He and his mother hadn't even taken seats in a pew before the preacher started spewing a diatribe of venomous, homophobic remarks from the pulpit. It took a moment before Shayne realized the preacher was attacking him. "Basically, the pastor ran me out of the church," he told me recently. "I stopped going after that."

Shayne's now 25 and the designer of menswear label Hood By Air, whose provocative styles—along with brands like Telfar and Third Floor—are carving out a new and empowering palette of masculinity for young black men to paint from. At Shayne's shows, it's not out of the ordinary to see his models stalk the runway in makeup and dresses. Their bellies are often exposed, and half the time you can't tell whether they're men or women. But far from sissiness, the looks exude the visceral power of a lineman crushing a quarterback, or two swords clashing in an action film. This time last year, at Shayne's debut New York Fashion Week runway show, the scene was so thick I had to stand on my tiptoes to catch a glimpse of his powerful vision of androgynous modern menswear. With macho gangster rapper A$AP Rocky on the catwalk, and stars like Kanye West and Waka Flocka Flame in the crowd offering up their adulation, the show was the birth of a new epoch in the evolution of black masculinity.

There have been others who've pushed similar boundaries in the past. Before Kanye and A$AP, black artists like Sly and the Family Stone in the 60s and Cameo in the 80s wore gear that looked like it was straight out of the Folsom Street Fair. In the 90s, Tupac walked in a Versace fashion show in a flamboyant gold suit.

But one of the things that sets this new wave apart from what came before is that straight men like Kanye and Rocky have no problem recognizing

If one of our own is shot down, still alive and not yet in enemy captivity, we will either come to get him or die trying. Among America’s fighting forces, the calm, sure knowledge that such an irrevocable bond exists is priceless. Along with individual faith and personal grit, it is a sacred trust that has often sustained hope in the face of terribly long odds.

The disgraceful abandonment of our Ambassador and those brave ex-SEALs who fought to their deaths to save others in that compound is nothing short of dereliction-of-duty. Additionally, the patently absurd cover-up scenario that was fabricated in the aftermath was an outright lie in attempt to shield the President and the Secretary of State from responsibility.

It has been over eight months since the attack on our compound in Benghazi. The White House strategy, with the aid of a “lap dog press” has been to run out the clock before the truth is forthcoming. The recent testimonies of the three “whistle blowers” have reopened the subject and hopefully will lead to exposure and disgrace of those responsible for this embarrassing debacle.

It would appear that the most recent firewall which the Administration is counting on is the contention that there were simply no military assets that could be brought to bear in time to make a difference… mainly due to the unavailability of tanker support for fighter aircraft. This is simply BS, regardless how many supposed “experts” the Administration trot out to make such an assertion. The bottom line is that even if the closest asset capable of response was half-way around the world, you don’t just sit on your penguin *** and do nothing. The fact is that the closest asset was not half-way around the world, but as near as Aviano Air Base, Italy where two squadrons of F-16Cs are based.

Consider the following scenario (all times Benghazi local):

When Hicks in Tripoli receives a call at 9:40 PM from Ambassador Stevens informing him “Greg, we are under attack!” (his last words), he immediately notifies all agencies and prepares for the immediate initiation of an existing “Emergency Response Plan.” At AFRICON, General Carter Ham attempts to mount a rescue effort, but is told to “stand down.” By 10:30 PM an unarmed drone is overhead the compound and streaming live feed to various Command

WARNING: this article involves feminism. Those offended by the idea of gender equality should STEP AWAY FROM THEIR COMPUTERS NOW and get back inside their caves. Not a misogynist? Then hey buddy, sit back and relax. I’d offer you a cup of tea but you’re miles away (and I don’t have any tea).

Sexism permeates our society, that’s a given, but you might not have realised just how much it occurs in gaming. There are three levels at which it exists: at an industry level, in games themselves, and from within gamers. It’s vital that we are aware of these problems but, more importantly, we have to do our best in tackling them. To do this, we must look at each problem in turn.

First: sexism in the industry. There is evidence that suggests women who work in gaming are under-represented and suffer some of the worst gender-based harassment. Female gamers make up 45% of the gaming population; yet male game designers make up 89% of the industry and earn 23.6% more than their female counterparts. What a kick in the balls vagina. There have also been many high-profile incidents of women being harassed by men in the workplace. One of the most recent stories involved Josh Mattingly, CEO and founder of Indiestatik, publicly apologising and “stepping down” after sending a female game developer inappropriate and unprovoked sexual messages on Facebook.

People have claimed that women should just stand up for themselves and that speaking up against those that harass them should be enough to stop the problem, but there is not always a clear cut solution. The #thatwoman hashtag shows that in speaking up, women are likely to be ostracised and have it limit their future career. Perhaps the risk would be worth the overall benefits, but it is understandable why women in gaming don’t always feel free to confront those that may oppress or belittle them. It would be like Yoshi trying to stand up to Mario – he’s just going to drop Yoshi mid-jump and carry on like nothing happened anyway.

Similarly, the #1reasonwhy hashtag asked women to speak out about why they don’t feel comfortable in the gaming industry. The results included stories of groping and being constantly mistaken for assistants and receptionists.

Visiting two VFW halls near St. Louis on Wednesday, McCaskill, the Democrat Akin is hoping to unseat here in Missouri, went through a list of Akin votes that took more than two minutes to recite.

Audiences were mostly male and senior citizen. Survivors of combat in Vietnam – and at least one World War II veteran – looked on beneath baseball caps decorated with military insignia as she accused Akin of blocking bonuses for troops stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan and voting against health care benefits for reservists and national guard members.

“So that’s kind of the list,” McCaskill said of Akin’s voting record. “Now, I don’t have a list like that."

The attack did not include any mention of the recent controversy embroiling Akin.

Sunday, Akin told a television interviewer that women could biologically prevent pregnancies resulting from what he called “legitimate rape.”

The remarks set off a firestorm, but Wednesday McCaskill only alluded to them broadly.

During a press conference outside a VFW home in nearby Overland, McCaskill brushed aside questions about Akin’s future.

“The voters have spoken, and he’s the nominee,” McCaskill said.

“We’re going to draw the contrasts that I think are necessary so that voters know that he’s outside the mainstream, he’s very extreme,” she added later.

Tuesday, Akin let a deadline for withdrawing from the Senate race pass.

Rep. Todd Akin, R-Mo., confirms with TODAY's Matt Lauer that vice presidential candidate and fellow congressman Paul Ryan advised him to step down amid the fallout of comments he made about rape and abortion.

He told NBC’s Matt Lauer during a Wednesday interview on the TODAY show that his nomination was a “decision made by the citizens of our state, not the party bosses.”

McCaskill’s VFW visits were part of a so-called “Vets for Claire” listening tour that the campaign says was arranged prior to the Akin controversy.

A VFW official in Overland asked reporters to hold McCaskill’s press conference outside the building, in order to keep the organization compliant with rules prohibiting political activity by 501(c)(3) charity groups

Humanity Should be 10% Male 90% Female (BC Prof Mary Daly)

Posted on by beckett

What Is Enlightenment (Susan Bridle): Which brings us to another question I wanted to ask you. Sally Miller Gearhart, in her article "The Future If There Is One Is Female" writes: "At least three further requirements supplement the strategies of environmentalists if we were to create and preserve a less violent world. 1) Every culture must begin to affirm the female future. 2) Species responsibility must be returned to women in every culture. 3) The proportion of men must be reduced to and maintained at approximately ten percent of the human race." What do you think about this statement?

Mary Daly: I think it's not a bad idea at all. If life is to survive on this planet, there must be a decontamination of the Earth. I think this will be accompanied by an evolutionary process that will result in a drastic reduction of the population of males. People are afraid to say that kind of stuff anymore.

WIE: Yes. I find myself now thinking that's a bit shocking.

MD: Well, it's shocking that it would be shocking.

WIE: So it doesn't sound like your vision of a separate nation for women is something you see as an interim stage that would eventually lead to men and women living together in true equality.

MD: No. That's a very old question. I answered that to audiences twenty-five, thirty years ago. I just don't think that way. See, right now, I would be totally joyous to have a great community of women whether men are somewhere out on the periphery or not. I don't have this goal of: "Oh, then we can all get together again!" That doesn't seem to be a very promising future. So why would I think about it? I think it's pretty evident that men are not central to my thought.

WIE: I have one last question. At the beginning of this interview, you spoke about the experience of being deeply at one with that which animates all of life. I wanted to ask you what you think about the possibility of becoming identified with that as who one ultimately is, having that as one's ultimate resting place, or ground, so to speak, and where one's gender would no longer be a primary reference point.

MD: I don't know if that has anything to do with my experience. I have my own experience of oneness.

Somewhere in some distant and undoubtedly frightening corner of the internet, there may already be a backlash against the backlash.

The basic premise is a simple, stupid, and unfortunately familiar one: a man decided to do something for women and finally do it RIGHT, dad gum it, ignoring that there were already women doing this thing, and despite his own total cluelessness about the topic at hand. The man in this case is Bryan Goldberg, founder of the also not-great media outlet Bleacher Report.

Goldberg decided it was time for a “women’s publication that puts world news and politics alongside beauty tips.” He managed to raise $6.5 million in venture capital to do this. (Bustle’s editorial team is entirely female [UPDATE: There are at least two men writing regularly for Bustle], and Goldberg has indicated an alleged lack of interest in editorial decisions with the statement, “Knowing the difference between mascara, concealer, and eye-liner is not my job,” but the company is very clearly headed by a man.) Maybe the reason Goldberg didn’t realize he was years behind the curve on this idea is that he thinks Vogue and Glamour are the frontrunners of online women’s media, theorizing that since Vogue had “fewer than 1 million unique visitors in June,” there was an obvious void for Bustle to step into. (Jezebel had 2.1 million unique visitors per month three years ago, and now has 5.1 million monthly visitors.) (And Glamour does include politics with its beauty tips.) Ironically, one of the publications Goldberg identified as being “aimed at men,” Business Insider, has even posted a piece covering women’s frustration with this move. All in all, it’s quickly become abundantly clear that Goldberg decided to execute a bad idea without deciding to learn anything about it first. And still got financing for it.

In this unbelievably misguided launch piece, Goldberg dares to assert the following:

“Women’s publishers have completely lost sight of which decade their readers are living in. This is a country where women out-graduate men. They are also closing the “income gap” quickly, and in many cities, they out-earn their male counterparts. But magazines like UsWeekly talk to women as though they were children, and they fail to connect popular culture with any form of social commentary.”

According to Breitbart:

“At the State of the Union address … when you are in the room what you can see is this real dichotomy. It’s a feeling of color almost. On one side of the room is literally gray and white. Literally, that is the color palette on one side of the room. On the other side of the room, there are yellows and blues and whites and greens.

The six women, aged between 19 and 24, will be the first female Taiwanese soldiers ever to serve on the Dongsha (Pratas) Islands and Taiping Island in the Spratly Islands, according to the administration.

They are among some 21 volunteer soldiers who are receiving training for service on the two South China Sea islands, a CGA official said.

"Three of them are preparing to work on the Dongsha Islands and the other three are going to Taiping Island," the official said.

At present, 100 soldiers and officers are serving on Taiping Island, the largest islet in the Spratlys, while 150 officers and enlisted men are working on the Dongsha Islands.

"All of them are men," the CGA official said.

The six women are scheduled to begin their service on the islands in late June, the official said, adding that relevant facilities, including female dormitories, have been set up in preparation for their arrival.

Taiping Island lies 1,600 km to the southwest of Kaohsiung, while the Dongsha islands are 450 km to the southwest of the southern port city.

As Taiwan has decided to move from a conscription to an all-volunteer military by the end of 2014, the CGA has been carrying out a recruitment drive since the beginning of this year.

HBO’s Silicon Valley captures a world you’ve rarely seen depicted with intelligence or care, populated by types that you didn’t know were types; it’s sometimes sweet but often brutal, but thanks to the keen satirical eye of its co-creator, Mike Judge (Office Space), you never feel that you’re watching unfair swipes. It’s about prospectors in what might be the last remaining gold rush, the world of tech in Northern California. That so many of the claims yield fool’s gold gives the characters’ grandiose pronouncements about their own talent a certain poignancy. Everybody on this show wants to be the next Steve Jobs, but a lot of them are lucky just to have jobs. “Do you know how sea turtles have, like, a shit-ton of babies?” asks a tech-industry-lawyer character. “Because most of them die on the way down to the water.”

Silicon Valley, which premieres Sunday, April 6, fuses the white-collar purgatory of Office Space with the Hollywood wonderland of knaves and fools depicted on Entourage, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and The Larry Sanders Show. The place is a human zoo filled with narcissists, most of whom would be insufferable if they weren’t so nakedly needy. The hero, Richard (Thomas Middleditch), is a classic Mike Judge everyman, with an added dose of brilliance and perhaps a mild case of Asperger’s. He lives and works in a ranch-style house known as an “incubator.” Its owner is Erlich (T. J. Miller), an arrogant pothead who sold his own start-up years ago and rolled the money over into this for-profit commune, where would-be entrepreneurs live in exchange for promising Erlich 10 percent of anything they sell. On Entourage, this setup would have yielded a nonstop series of deranged bacchanals, but here it seems about as randy as a meeting of a high-school yearbook committee, minus the girls. Like Silicon Valley the place, Silicon Valley the show is so male that it seems as if somebody dropped a bomb in Palo Alto that eliminated most of the women. The writers mock this borderline ­monoculture at every turn. The show kicks off at a private party at which Kid Rock sings but no one dances and the segregation of men and women is so drastic that a character likens it to “a Hasidic wedding.” The house’s lone non

When Gretchen Carlson sued Roger Ailes for sexual harassment earlier this month, I wasn’t shocked; my classmates and I had learned from an Emmy-winning producer just how common behavior like Carlson described was in newsrooms across the country.

While at this point, we simply don’t know if the allegations are true, we also learned that if we ever experienced harassment of any sort, we should go to our boss immediately. In fact, in the nine places I’ve worked, I was told to do that every time. At Barnes & Noble, my managers asked a man who was saying lewd things to me to leave the premises. At the spa where I worked reception in college, the owner believed me the moment I told her we were getting creepy phone calls. She helped me create a list of the phone numbers making the calls. When one of them called the next time, she picked up and let them have it. That gave me the impression I was valued. My safety was prioritized above a sale.

Since the second wave of feminism in the 1960s and ’70s, women have been infiltrating and dominating the workforce through nearly every field, but it’s no secret that walking into a well-established boys’ club can be a dangerous gamble. That doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be done. One of the important roles of a manager in the workplace is to provide support to employees who need it. Women who believe they were harassed on the job are employees who need it. Bosses should be the first line of defense against an alleged hostile work environment.

That’s why what Neil Cavuto did this week is so unconscionable. He defended Ailes against Carlson’s allegations and as someone who has a show on Fox News Channel, he joined ranks with a host of other employees of the network. Unlike Harris Faulkner or Greta Van Susteren or Geraldo Rivera, though, he isn’t just a host. According to the Fox website, he is also senior vice president and managing editor of not only Fox News Channel, but Fox Business, too.

And it’s not just men supporting their own gender: One in five men and women said they would rather work with a male colleague.

Perhaps this male confidence also stems from believing in their own success.

Most men in the MSN poll believed that the gender gap is an issue of the past. 40% of men surveyed said that women are treated “very fairly” in the workplace while only 17% of women believed the same. This reinforces a separate study that found 58% of U.S. men in the workforce believed that “all obstacles to gender equality are gone.”

That’s what researchers found in studies on confidence in the workplace: men are more confident —almost unquestioning— in their abilities and more confident that when things go wrong at work, it’s their gender, and not their performance, that’s to blame. As Ladders has previously reported, male leaders have an advantage and are better liked — across generations.

Millennial men believe men make better leaders

Multiples studies got the same result: men are very confident in their abilities—so confident that they suspect discrimination when they don’t get the job. Out of the 8,000 millennials aged between 18-34 that Qualtrics and Accel surveyed, 33% of millennial men believed that they had faced frequent gender discrimination at work, compared with the 21% of millennial women who felt the same way.

Moreover, millennial men were 50% more likely to believe that their gender was “affecting their career opportunities,” although Qualtrics didn’t say whether the men believed the effect was positive or negative, meaning whether the men believed they received better or worse opportunities because of their gender.

Meanwhile, women were more likely to believe in gender equality at work, with 41% believing that men and women are “judged by the same criteria in the workplace.”

The Qualtrics study also showed vastly different views between young men and women on what makes a good boss or leader.

For instance, millennial men are more likely than their female counterparts to believe that men are more effective leaders, with 38% of young men saying that compared to 14% of young women.

And, while millennial men and women both mostly had no preference for their boss’s gender, they tend to favor strictly gender-limited workplaces: Two-thirds of millennial women and 72% of men prefer to work

Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page

{sergey, page}@cs.stanford.edu

Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305

Abstract

In this paper, we present Google, a prototype of a large-scale search engine which makes heavy use of the structure present in hypertext. Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/

To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine -- the first such detailed public description we know of to date.

Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.

1.2. Google: Scaling with the Web

These tasks are becoming increasingly difficult as the Web grows. However, hardware performance and cost have improved dramatically to partially offset the difficulty. There are, however, several notable exceptions to this progress such as disk seek time and operating system robustness. In designing Google, we have considered both the rate of growth of the Web and technological changes. Google is designed to scale well to extremely large data sets. It makes efficient use of storage space to store the index. Its data structures are optimized for fast and efficient access (see section 4.2). Further, we expect that the cost to index and store text or HTML will eventually decline relative to the amount that will be available

The Breitbart editor and professional political agitator (recently banned from Twitter for harassment) came under fire this week as allegations surfaced that his charity, which would provide college scholarships exclusively to white men, has so far done no charity work with the money.

Yiannopoulos told The Daily Beast on Thursday that his lawyers are drafting paperwork that would establish it as a legal charity, but experts say that the way in which the “Yiannopoulos Privilege Grant” accepted donations was unethical and possibly illegal.

Yiannopoulos promised in January to create a college scholarship fund for “white men who wish to pursue their post-secondary education” that would be awarded in “early summer 2016.” The fund has raised somewhere between $100,000 and $250,000 to date, Yiannopoulos told The Daily Beast via email.

But the Yiannopoulos Privilege Grant has not filed any paperwork to become a charity in the United States. When asked if an application for tax-exempt status had been sent by his lawyers to the Internal Revenue Service, Yiannopoulos said, “I’ll check.”

No scholarships have been awarded and the charity’s website shows there isn’t even a way for prospective students to apply for them.

The grant program was announced with the self-congratulatory fanfare typical of many Breitbart articles written about its chief firebrand.

“In a move certain to infuriate the left, Breitbart Tech Editor Milo Yiannopoulos has created the Yiannopoulos Privilege Grant, a scholarship exclusively available to white men who wish to pursue their post-secondary education on equal footing with their female, queer and ethnic minority classmates,” staff writer William Bigelow wrote in Breitbart, providing a wide audience for the grant’s publicity, on Jan. 21 this year.

The promise at the time was that the fund would disburse 50 grants of $2,500 to poor, young white men, a move intended to rile the left and raise the profile of the website and the so-called alt-right, a movement whose ascendancy reached new heights this week when Breitbart News executive Steve Bannon was made chairman of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.

After the initial announcement in January, Yiannopoulos and several figures in the alt-right hosted a five-hour online telethon to collect money from donors. In the description for the video on Yiannopoulos’s account, there is a

In front of Calgary City Hall, a couple dozen of them stood shoulder-to-shoulder in an attempt to make an unbreakable human wall. Each of them wore a uniform consisting of a black T-shirt emblazoned with a Roman helmet—a look that wouldn't be out of place in a biker gang. It was a line filled with mostly men, and a few women, who you wouldn't want to go toe-to-toe with in a bar. All of them were white.

Some of the III% (the "three percent," as they call themselves) brought shock canes—a non-lethal weapon that can deliver up to a million volts to the person hit—while others had billy clubs or regular old canes. On many of the shirts was the III%'s credo, "NSA"—Never Standing Alone. Scattered throughout the rest of the square were small groups overseeing the proceedings from an elevated position, as well as III%er members dressed in plain clothes milling about the crowd gathering "intel" on what they considered to be the day's enemy—Antifa, the anti-fascist group.

In front of the line their leader, Beau Welling, the president of the Alberta chapter and national vice-president of the III%, stood calling commands quietly into a mobile phone he held like a walkie talkie.

A few hours earlier, the group had swept the perimeter checking the potted plants that surround the municipal building for any improvised explosive device. They were concerned that ISIS might target the event or that Antifa may have planted weapons beforehand.

The group of III%ers was attending the rally as "security detail" for a controversial anti-Islam speaker named Sandra Solomon, who was involved in a dust up with anti-fascists in Winnipeg a few days prior. Welling had made it clear to the group beforehand that attendance was mandatory, citing the Winnipeg incident and partisan violence south of the border.

This was effectively the III% Alberta's coming out party—a planned operation that they called "Operation Shock N Awe"—and a show of force by a far-right anti-Islamic organization that claims to be heavily armed and ready for "war" on Canadian soil.

We looked at several sources on the Internet and found that these are the main contributing factors:

Homesickness and feeling that you don’t fit in. It’s a whole new world out there, and you may not be ready to embrace it. Educational burnout. While college gives you control and flexibility over your schedule, the hard demanding schedule, challenging courses, and boatload of homework certainly has turned a lot of students away from the desire to continue. Academic unpreparedness. Sometimes, high school didn’t really prepare students for college. Other times, students slacked off in high school and paid the price during their post-secondary years. The high school goal was to pass (so that students could get into college); in college, it is to succeed. Personal or family issues. You may have had an unfortunate illness in the family or you yourself just got totally get stressed out from the workload. Financial constraints. Tuition costs continue to soar, and scholarships or grants are not always available. Additionally, financial situations can change from year to year. Too much fun — but not enough education. Some students take advantage of their friendships, which could put them on academic probation due to suffering grades or absence in classes. The school isn’t a good academic fit for the student. You’ve selected a great school that is very arts-centric. However, you realize that you like the sciences better. Similarly, you may hate the average class size of 100 and prefer much smaller classes for more individualized attention. Setting sights on the wrong major. You may have wanted to be a doctor but after taking several science classes, you decided that you’re rather go into marketing. Does your school have a marketing major? If not, you’re likely to go elsewhere. No guidance or mentors. In high school, teachers and counselors were there to guide you, as high school classes are typically smaller than the entering freshman class. It’s a lot harder to get the personalized attention that you’ve been used to and that could turn people off quickly. External demands, particularly within part time or full time employment. Can we say Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook? When the job puts too many demands on you, you may have to choose, and money usually wins out. Time to move out. If the cold winter just doesn’t suit you, you may decide to go elsewhere. You may want

What a difference a policy area makes.

In our nation’s social welfare programs, such as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, bad decisions are grounds for sanctions and a denial of assistance–not a helping hand or a cash infusion (Just imagine!). Certainly, our leaders have not treated poverty as an emergency or a reason for government action.

Other differences abound….

Corporate welfare: Corporate executives, mostly men, being bailed out.

Social welfare: Mostly low-income women with children, being given minimal assistance, and certainly not enough to help move them out of poverty.

Corporate welfare: Few restrictions on the money.

Social welfare: TANF beneficiaries face numerous restrictions, including having to sign a “personal responsibility” statement in some states (Something, personally, I’d like to see these corporate executive do).

Corporate welfare: It is a major “concession” not to cap compensation to the executives in the affected firms.

Social welfare: Under TANF, most states impose income and asset limits on eligibility. For assets, these limits are generally between $2,000 and $3,000. In some states, if your car is worth much more than this, you are not eligible. (States similarly limit eligibility for Food Stamps and Medicaid.)

So, how many of our corporate executives would be disqualified from the bailout if this were taken into account?

Corporate welfare: Few details about the accountability required under this bailout are available. Given the lobbying frenzy around the agreement, don’t expect much.

Social welfare: Significant oversight, including additional and burdensome requirements around supervision and documentation of program participation enacted in 2005 and codified in regulations earlier this year.

Corporate welfare: $700 billion.

Social welfare: $16 billion per year, which has not changed since 1996.

Just think what a $700 billion investment in poverty reduction could do. Bailouts to help low-income single mothers get job training to move them into careers with good pay and benefits, and a lifetime of economic independence. Bailouts to support access to quality child care so that single mothers could afford to leave their children in a safe environment while they go to work. Bailouts to support transportation vouchers that would get low-income parents to job training sites or works

“With equity and inclusion in mind, we have decided that residential fraternities must become fully co-educational over the next three years,” top university officials said in an email to the university community.

“If the organizations are to continue to be recognized as offering housing and social spaces for Wesleyan students, women as well as men must be full members and well-represented in the body and leadership of the organization,” said the email from Joshua Boger and Michael S. Roth, the chair and president of the Board of Trustees, respectively.

The move comes after a student filed a lawsuit saying she was raped in 2o13 at a fraternity party, and that multiple party attendees watched. The email said the school had been considering what to do about Greek life at Wesleyan for years, and received input over the summer from students, faculty and alumni.

Other schools like Trinity College have made similar changes in recent years (though not without student protest). The Wesleyan website reads, “Greek life is small at Wes.” There are a small number of fraternities on campus, some with houses and some without. There is only one sorority and it does not have a house. The school already has other co-ed societies.

<|begin_of_text|>An experimental Marine Corps study obtained by the Monitor has concluded that units with both men and women are less effective than all-male units.

The results of the experiment, known as the Ground Combat Element Integrated Task Force (GCEITF), could be used by the Marines as grounds to ask for an exemption to the combat exclusion policy, which currently bars women from taking part in direct combat.

The services have until January to open all jobs to women, or ask Pentagon leaders for an exemption by October.

The GCEITF included roughly 200 male and 75 female volunteers, who were evaluated on how they performed a series of physical combat tasks between March and May.

The results of the study come on the heels of news last month that two women passed the Army’s grueling Ranger School and earned their Ranger tabs.

The Marine Corps’ conclusions have sparked criticism from female Marines and others, who argue that the study was poorly conducted and biased toward a belief that men are biologically and psychologically built to be better fighters.

Indeed, efforts to integrate combat units constitute “social engineering,” Lt. Gen. Gregory Newbold, a former Marine infantryman who served as Director of Operations on the Pentagon’s Joint Staff before he retired, argued in an op-ed this week that was widely seen as laying the groundwork for the Marines’ experimental task force study release.

In introducing its conclusions, the Marine Corps cites the “the brutal and extremely physical nature of direct ground combat, often marked by close, interpersonal violence.”

It further argues that the nature of battle “remains largely unchanged throughout centuries of warfare, despite technological advancements.”

Mr. Newbold echoes similar points, citing “the burden of 30 to 80 pounds of personal equipment, mind-bending physical exertion, energy-sapping adrenaline highs, or the fact that the threadbare clothes you wore were unchanged for over three weeks and may have been'scented' by everything from food, to blood, dysentery, and whatever was in the dirt that constituted your bed. And don’t forget insects of legendary proportion and number,” he adds in his op-ed, published by the War on the Rocks, a highly-regarded military blog.

“More importantly,” Newbold argues, are the bonds with comrades who experienced the “shared duties of clearing the urinals, the pleasures of a several nights of hilarious debauchery, and multiple near-death experiences – a comrade in arms who has heard more about your personal thoughts than your most intimate friends or family.”

Though Newbold acknowledges that the two

In the case of Gabriele Köpp, that life has included a high-school education and a training program as a physical and technical assistant. It has also included an affinity for "pure mathematics," as Köpp calls it, and for physics.

She is fascinated with the power of the tiniest particles, or, quoting Goethe, with "what holds the world together in its innermost self." Because of her fascination for elementary particles, she went on to earn a doctorate in physics and eventually became a university professor.

Her life has also included many friendships, primarily with men, from doctoral students to colleagues to Nobel laureates. And there are also eight godchildren in her life.

Nevertheless, for Gabriele Köpp, what happened in the space of only 14 days was enough to cast a dark shadow over the rest of her life, the remainder of those 29,200 days.

No Home to Return To

Köpp is sitting in an armchair in her Berlin apartment, talking about those 14 days. She serves freshly brewed coffee with condensed milk out of a can. She smokes the long, thin Kim brand of cigarettes, which have become rare in Germany.

There are black-and-white photographs of her mother, her father and her sisters hanging on the walls. They are all dead. There are also photos of her parents' house, including exterior and interior views. The house was in Schneidemühl, a town in the former German region of Pomerania; today the town is called Pila and is located in northwestern Poland. Where the house stood is nothing but a meadow today.

Köpp describes the photos with German words from a distant era: the Salon with its chandelier, her father's Herrenzimmer ("study"). Her pronunciation also betrays her roots. She says "Tack" instead of "Tag" (the informal version of "Guten Tag," or "hello"), just like many others who originally come from regions that were once German and are now Polish.

Köpp's apartment is not one of those long-occupied flats that contain layer upon layer of the possessions its occupant has accumulated over the years. She only took the apartment about 10 years ago, when she retired from her position at the Technical University of Aachen in western Germany and moved to Berlin.

She will sound the alarm and the rest of the coven will arrive, ready to set fire to the wicker man.

The social justice warrior phenomenon is mostly a product of Facebook and Twitter, as these services made it easier for stupid people to get on-line and blast their idiocy worldwide. As a result, unhinged young women now have easy access to a megaphone. Whenever one of them gets the boo-hoos or feels slighted by a man, she can give a couple of blasts on the horn and before long we have #gamergate or some other nonsense controversy.

That’s the most striking feature of the social justice warrior phenomenon. It is young, unattached females. Put #gamegate into a google machine and the third hit is a blog run by a lonely, unstable female. In fact, feminism today is just that, lonely unattached females looking for a purpose to their lives. Instead of snagging a husband and having kids, they kit themselves out like extras from the freak show and scream at men for not loving them. Instead of tending to children, they talk endlessly about their unused female parts.

Much of what is going wrong in the West is some version of what we are seeing with the endless hashtag campaigns run by women. The female of our species has a biological purpose. That’s to find a suitable mate, bear children and raise them to sexual maturity. That’s nature’s assignment to women. Anything else is either in support of that purpose, frivolous or in opposition to biological necessity.

The result of a century of feminism is a society that works against the interests of women. Young men

Theresa May, Donald Trump, Brexit, an uptick of racism and hate crimes, rising inflation, increasing property prices and the floundering pound. A lot has happened this year that you probably want to forget about, and the traditional way to forget – of course – is to drown your memory in booze, and stifle any remaining thoughts with one or more of your favourite drugs.

But as you might have already surmised, that's not always the best course of action. Dr Sheri Jacobson, clinical director of Harley Therapy, points out that both drugs and alcohol actually provide a temporary high that, over a long-term basis, keeps the user in a cycle of low moods.

"Alcohol, for example, is a depressant, and it actually messes with the neurotransmitters in your brain, including the one needed to help you keep anxiety at bay," she says. So while drinking is often thought of as a way to "wind down" after a demanding day, in fact it can have quite the opposite effect.

"If you already had any kind of mental health issue, like anxiety or bipolar disorder, substances are likely to make your condition worse, not better," says Dr Jacobson. "And if you have a genetic risk for a mental disorder, drug or alcohol use gives you at a higher chance of developing it."

Drug and alcohol misuse is particularly prevalent in men. In 2014, men accounted for approximately 65 percent of all alcohol-related deaths in the UK, and in 2014-2015, 74 percent of hospital admissions with a primary diagnosis of drug-related mental and behavioural disorders were men. Depression and anxiety are common in individuals with a history of substance abuse, and the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry suggests that one in three adults who abuses drugs or alcohol is also affected by depression.

Male mental health might be more talked about than ever in the media, but last month the charities Mind and Rethink Mental Illness released a study from their campaign Time to Change showing that 54 percent of male teenagers suffering from mental health issues chose to keep their problems to themselves. Despite more and more celebrities outing themselves as sufferers of depression and anxiety, and media-run campaigns encouraging men to talk about what's troubling them, many are still keeping things to themselves.

There are, of course, many reasons why that might be. But I'm personally aware of a number of men whose mental health problems have been clouded by pints, drugs, hangovers and comedowns

<|begin_of_text|>There seems to be a widespread misconception in the Orthodox world that the upcoming holiday of Simchat Torah is a “men’s holiday.”

I can understand the confusion, stemming from what we celebrate and how we celebrate it. Simchat Torah has evolved as a celebration of the annual cycle of weekly Torah readings—readings which, in Orthodox shuls, occur purely on the men’s side of the mechitza (divider). And we celebrate it by taking all the Torah scrolls out of the ark—also on the men’s side—and dancing seven circuits, or hakafos, with them. There is much joyful singing, generally in a masculine timbre, and the dancing men take turns holding the heavy scrolls.

READ: This is the Torah

With so much action naturally taking place on the other side, I can understand—sort of—why things tend to be much less lively on my side of the mechitza. Depending on the community, the women might dance, but it is rarely as exuberant, as populated, or as sustained as the men’s dancing. My childhood memories of the holiday involve a core group of women who enjoyed dancing and would try to get things going, while most of the women might join for a few minutes in between their primary activities of chatting, chasing sugared-up children (did I mention excessive candy often plays a role in the celebrations?), and watching the men. From what I have experienced and heard since, my shul was fairly typical, though in many places the women don’t dance at all—or even show up.

My husband likes to tell of the girl he once dated who was surprised at the suggestion that she might go to shul on Simchat Torah. “Why would I go?” she asked. “I have no one to watch!” For her, I think, it was accepted as a matter of course that dancing on Simchat Torah is what men do, and she wouldn’t have ever imagined that she could—or should—have a part in it.

For others, the questions around women and Simchat Torah are more fraught—and many focus on the Torah scrolls themselves, arguing that if the women can’t dance with a Torah, then they feel excluded, like their dancing is pointless. Indeed, in more recent years, as this sort of discomfort with gender disparities has increased, many rabbis have concluded that there is no real halachic problem with a woman carrying a Torah scroll, and in some shuls a scroll or two will be passed to the women’s side for the dancing

Two female scientists have had their research paper rejected by a peer review journal because it wasn't co-authored by a male.

That's right.

Dr Fiona Ingleby from the University of Sussex and Dr Megan Head from ANU wrote a paper about how gender differences influence the experiences of PHD students transitioning to post-doctoral studies, and submitted it to PLoS One, a journal from the Public Library of Science.

In an incredible demonstration of their point and some amazing comedic use of irony (actually not funny though), the reviewer's response was that they should get a male (any male, really) to co-author the study, "to serve as a possible check against interpretations that may sometimes be drifting too far away from empirical evidence into ideologically-based assumptions". Just... wow.

It gets worse, though. The reviewer actually makes some rather helpful suggestions for answers to their hypothesis these doctors had obviously not considered, due to being women.

For example, perhaps male doctoral students co-author more papers on average than women because men can run faster than women.

Or perhaps these woman researchers hadn't considered that men get published in better journals than women because men work longer hours, because they have better stamina.

This is actually what the guy said. An incredulous Dr Fiona Ingleby tweeted screenshots, because empirical evidence.

Writer Kelly Sue DeConnick once noted that a disturbing number of female characters in modern stories (including movies) fail to pass The Sexy Lamp test. This means the majority of female characters in Hollywood can pretty much be replaced with a “sexy lamp”, as they don’t accomplish anything and only serve the purpose of being a good-looking prop for men to fight over.

CAPTION: Pictured: Hollywood’s idea of an empowered, independent woman.

What you might not know is that some of these women were far less lamp-like in the original stories that their movies were based on. A lot of times, a TV or movie adaptation of a story will go out of it’s way to make the leading lady more passive and give her accomplishments to a male character

There can be multiple reasons for this and generally all of them are dumb. It could be that the producers wanted to take away the lady’s screentime to give the male lead more time to flex his bulging biceps; it could be they felt they absolutely had to have a helpless woman to tug at the audience’s tender heartstrings or in some cases, they simply could not even fathom the idea of a woman actually accomplishing anything.

These seven examples explore all the weird and dumb ways women can go from an active characters in the original to alluring light fixtures in the film version.

The orphan siblings in question were Violet, who was basically MacGyver with a bow; Klaus, the character who tricks kids into buying up the series when they see him on the cover and think he’s Harry Potter, and Sunny, a baby with freaking shark teeth who will haunt your nightmares.

As it stands, having four- to five-times the amount of Asians represented in California’s premier school system isn’t necessarily a bad thing. But the breakdown is certainly telling in terms of where balance is needed. In a state funded education system where Asians make up only 12.4% of California’s population, Asians make up 40% of the university’s student body.

To address the imbalance, UC regents have decided to relax admission standards in order to expand the UC applicant pool.

As it stands, Fall 2008 admissions data from UC schools indicate the following breakdown:

University of California, Berkeley

Asian-American: 46%

White: 30.2%

Latino: 11.5%

African-American: 3.7%

University of California, Los Angeles

Asian-American: 38%

White: 34%

Latino: 15%

African-American: 3%

University of California, Davis

Asian-American: 42%

White: 36%

Latino: 12%

African-American: 3%

University of California, Irvine

Asian-American: 51%

White: 24%

Latino: 12%

African-American: 2%

University of California, Santa Barbara

Asian-American: 19%

White: 53%

Latino: 19%

African-American: 3%

Effective in 2012, UC Regents have changed the admissions requirements and process to drop the SAT subject test (SAT II) and to extend automatic admissions to the 91st percentile of California high school students.

Applicants are currently required to maintain a certain GPA and SAT composite score that combines SAT and SAT II scores in order to qualify for UC. The new requirements will lax the current standards. But UC estimates the new changes would qualify 1,800 more black, 7,500 more Latinos, 15,000 more whites, and 4,000 Asian-American students.

Although the test is aimed to increase UC’s applicant pool, Asian- and African-American students benefit the least. Especially since Asian-Americans perform better on the soon-to-be dropped SAT II subject test and other minority and white students perform better on the SAT (I) reasoning test, Asian American political pundits suggest the new requirements will greatly reduce the number of Asian Americans in UCs.

Further, the Asian-American community is most outraged in UC’s lack of outreach

So what is a Men’s Rights Activist? Well if you ask a feminist, it is anyone who is against feminism. They literally use this term to describe any anti-feminist- The Amazing Atheist, Thunderf00t, Sargon of Akkad, Milo Your banana is a police, Pick Up Artists, GamerGaters; really anyone disagrees with them. You see the headlines, such as Men’s Rights Activists boycott Star Wars and Men’s Rights Activists joined the Alt-Right.

Most people who get called MRAs are not actually MRAs- they don’t identify as such, and don’t advocate for men’s issues, or at least it’s not a primary focus of theirs. But there are self-described Men’s Rights Activists. I consider myself one for instance, and we generally believe in Men’s Equality- with Anti-Feminism as just a side focus. So how did all these other guys get lumped in?

It all really started in 2012, when the SPLC but a bunch of Websites on a watchlist. Most of them were not Men’s Rights sites, but a few were lumped in such as A Voice for Men. Despite these sites being vastly different from each other in what they stand for, the Leftist SPLC placed them together to smear them.

On March 2014, when the Isla Vista Shootings occurred. The perpetrator, Elliot Rogers, was a failed pick-up-artists who wanted revenge on women for not dating him, as well as the men who did get into relationships. Elliot had zero connection to the Men’s Rights Movement and wasn’t even involved in much anti-feminism. However shortly after this event, media outlets described him as a Men’s Rights Activist. My pal, Bane666au covers this greatly in his video series “The Propoganda of Toxic Feminism” named after feminists described “Toxic Masculinity” as the reason why Elliot went on his rampage.

But the short story is that it was originally covered by a DailyKos article written by Ollie Garkie which claims Elliot Rogers was influenced by the Men’s Rights Movement. Hundreds of media outlets and thousands of feminists took this as truth and used it as an opportunity to smear Men’s

Tasmania’s northwest coast city of Burnie has long suffered high unemployment. In 2015, however, residents were shocked to find that unemployment among young people in Burnie had topped the nation: 21% of young men aged between 15 and 25 were neither employed nor studying. Just under half of all young people did not finish high school. And between 2011 and 2015, the number of Newstart recipients had grown by 40%.

Hard hit by the shrinking manufacturing sector, youth unemployment in the region was forecast to swell even further in the years ahead, to 33%. For young Burnie residents, the future looked bleak indeed.

Alarmed by these findings, the leadership of Australian rules football in Tasmania surveyed Burnie AFL players. They wanted to know how many of its players were unemployed and not studying.

They feared the worst. With Burnie football players in the bullseye of the most at-risk demographic – men under the age of 30, some from the lowest socioeconomic ranks – football officials were worried about their own.

What they found surprised even them. Club officials reported that not one of their players was unemployed. All were either employed or in full-time education. The employment (or studying) rate for AFL players in a city with the nation’s highest unemployment rate was 100%.

Asked to explain this remarkable disparity between young footballers and the rest of the community, club officials pointed to two simple factors.

First, young men who play football gain vital skills that make them employable. They show up on time, every time; they’ve learned how to work in teams; they understand that hard work and self-discipline lead to improvement; they are confident; they can cope with pressure; and they are fit and healthy – they don’t allow alcohol, junk food or drugs to overtake their lives.

Second, they are part of a social network that supports them. When faced with a risk of losing their job, someone from the club would connect these young people to someone else looking for reliable and capable young employees. Club members could recommend the young player for employment and, because of the footballers’ basic skills, be confident in doing so. The club officials don’t get paid to help; they just do it, because they

This course is an introduction to digital integrated circuits. The material will cover CMOS devices and manufacturing technology along with CMOS inverters and gates. Other topics include propagation delay, noise margins, power dissipation, and regenerative logic circuits. We will look at various design styles and architectures as well as the issues that designers must face, such as technology scaling and the impact of interconnect. Examples presented in class include arithmetic circuits, semiconductor memories, and other novel circuits.

The course will start with a detailed description and analysis of the core digital design block, the inverter. Implementations in CMOS will be discussed. Next, the design of more complex combinational gates such as NAND, NOR and EXORs will be discussed, looking at optimizing the speed, area, or power. The learned techniques will be applied on more evolved designs such as adders and multipliers. The influence of interconnect parasitics on circuit performance and approaches to cope with them are treated in detail. Substantial attention will then be devoted to sequential circuits, clocking approaches and memories. The course will be concluded with an examination of design methodologies.

Regardless of what you think about the protesters, the cause has grown from one mid-September march to a bona fide movement in dozens of cities. With voices from the far right claiming that the people protesting abuse of power by white men are mostly other white men, how are women in the movement making sure their voices aren't drowned out?

The Occupy Wall Street movement seems, to the outsider, to be about almost every possible progressive pet issue, but at its core, it's about taking up physical space. Much of the actions of government and business now occur within the virtual realm— numbers flashing across a screen, computer-based algorithms performing transactions that pass billions of dollars from one organization to another in microseconds, human-designed formulas denying actual humans medical coverage based on medical history and risk factors. The 99% of people who are currently getting hosed by the country's wealthiest 1% can't reclaim the virtual space that was never theirs, but they can assert themselves in the physical space that's rapidly being taken from them, sort of like how female participants in this year's SlutWalk movement publicly reclaim their bodies.

The movement's white male bent has prompted some female activists to opt not to participate in Occupy Wall Street at all. Over at In These Times, Sady Doyle isn't so sure that OWS cares about women, noting that the same men who had poked fun at her activism before OWS were now imploring her to join them in protest. She resents the movement's ostentatious goals and overestimation of its importance. Further, they didn't support her and other women involved in Slutwalk, so why would she support them? She writes,

The men I knew who had been Occupying Wall Street were still not there with me at the year's most heavily promoted anti-rape protest. I still couldn't rationally expect them to be. The "next global feminist movement" still wasn't moving strongly enough to occupy the city for three weeks. Or even one whole day.

Other activists are choosing the participate in the movement as reluctant educators. Racialicious contributors Hena Ashraf and Manissa McCleve Maharawal dropped in on Occupy Wall Street in late September.

Threading happens when someone has a lot of thoughts or feelings on a particular topic, so many that they can’t fit them all into 140 characters. So, ostensibly to help readers follow along on their train of thought, they thread the tweets together by replying to themselves. Sometimes they even use numbers!

Yesterday, a man named Eric Garland, a “strategic analyst for businesses and government agencies” with around 30K followers, decided it was time for some “game theory” without consultation from the rest of the internet (it wasn’t time and will never be time). The ensuing political rant is so insane and prolific it took up almost 6 pages when posted into a Google doc, and included a map. I dare you to read his thread in full and try to still respect yourself.

These activities include production of conventional, alternative and renewable sources of energy, and for the recovery and reuse of energy that would otherwise be wasted. Energy conservation and efficiency measures reduce the demand for energy development, and can have benefits to society with improvements to environmental issues.

Societies use energy for transportation, manufacturing, illumination, heating and air conditioning, and communication, for industrial, commercial, and domestic purposes. Energy resources may be classified as primary resources, where the resource can be used in substantially its original form, or as secondary resources, where the energy source must be converted into a more conveniently usable form. Non-renewable resources are significantly depleted by human use, whereas renewable resources are produced by ongoing processes that can sustain indefinite human exploitation.

Thousands of people are employed in the energy industry. The conventional industry comprises the petroleum industry, the natural gas industry, the electrical power industry, and the nuclear industry. New energy industries include the renewable energy industry, comprising alternative and sustainable manufacture, distribution, and sale of alternative fuels.

Classification of resources [ edit ]

Open System Model (basics)

Energy resources may be classified as primary resources, suitable for end use without conversion to another form, or secondary resources, where the usable form of energy required substantial conversion from a primary source. Examples of primary energy resources are wind power, solar power, wood fuel, fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, and uranium. Secondary resources are those such as electricity, hydrogen, or other synthetic fuels.

Another important classification is based on the time required to regenerate an energy resource. "Renewable" resources are those that recover their capacity in a time significant by human needs. Examples are hydroelectric power or wind power, when the natural phenomena that are the primary source of energy are ongoing and not depleted by human demands. Non-renewable resources are those that are significantly depleted by human usage and that will not recover their potential significantly during human lifetimes. An example of a non-renewable energy source is coal, which does not form naturally at a rate that would support human use.

Fossil fuels [ edit ]

Fossil fuel (primary non-renewable fossil) sources burn coal or hydrocarbon fuels, which are the remains of the decomposition of plants and animals. There are three main types of fossil fuels: coal, petroleum, and natural gas. Another fossil fuel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), is principally derived from the production of natural gas. Heat

But a particularly powerful letter came from a collection of racial justice activists, including Black Lives Matter.

The letter focused on potential civil rights abuses, should the FBI gain the power to conscript a technology company into undermining its own users’ security.

“One need only look to the days of J. Edgar Hoover and wiretapping of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. to recognize the FBI has not always respected the right to privacy for groups it did not agree with,” wrote the signatories, including arts and music nonprofit Beats, Rhymes & Relief, the Center for Media Justice, the Gathering for Justice, Justice League NYC, activist and writer Shaun King, and Black Lives Matter co-founder and Black Alliance for Just Immigration executive director Opal Tometi.

Those tactics haven’t ended, they argue. “Many of us, as civil rights advocates, have become targets of government surveillance for no reason beyond our advocacy or provision of social services for the underrepresented.”

In Washington and Silicon Valley, the debate over unbreakable encryption has an aura of elite, educated, mostly male whiteness — from the government representatives who condemn it to the experts who explain why it’s necessary.

But the main targets of law enforcement surveillance have historically been African-American and Muslim communities.

Malkia Cyril, co-founder of the Center for Media Justice, one of the letter’s signatories, gave a speech at one of several nationwide protests outside Apple stores two weeks ago, supporting the tech giant and pointing out the FBI’s history of surveilling black activists. “In the context of white supremacy and police violence, Black people need encryption,” she wrote in a tweet.

Others representing Black Lives Matter attended protests across the country, including in front of the FBI headquarters itself — the J. Edgar Hoover building — in downtown Washington, D.C.

“I’ve been reviewing the Apple vs. FBI lawsuit and now realize how important it is that that Apple wins the lawsuit. #DontHackApple,” DeRay Mckesson, Baltimore mayoral candidate and prominent Black Lives Matter organizer, tweeted on February 22. “When I was arrested in protest, my iPhones were in police custody. They were secure. The police couldn’t access my info,” he added. “If Apple has to create an insecure iPhone iOS app, all of the private data that we store on our phones is at risk.”

<|begin_of_text|>Anorexia nervosa is a mental illness characterised by a distorted body image, an extremely low body weight, and a fear of gaining weight. While anorexia affects all people, it is significantly more prevalent among women. Even though it is relatively rare, its effects are devastating.

Anorexia is notoriously difficult to treat. Across all mental illnesses, it has the highest rate of mortality, so research in this area is crucial.

It is not possible to determine a single cause of anorexia. Nevertheless, risk factors associated with the disease are well known. These include genetics, psychological predisposition, and social or cultural factors.

Increasingly, our social and cultural interactions take place online. It is, therefore, not surprising that online interactions intersect with mental illnesses generally, and anorexia specifically. This is particularly when taking into account that the average person who suffers from anorexia tends to be relatively young.

“Pro-ana” websites endorse anorexia as a positive choice, as opposed to a mental illness. Other variants include “pro-mia” websites, which endorse bulimia. These sites predominantly target women.

They promote a very thin body as the type that women must have. They give advice about how to become anorexic, how to hide an eating disorder from others and how to diet. The websites contain images of extremely thin women, which are sometimes altered to make the women appear thinner.

These websites have a long history. In 2001, Time Magazine noted the existence of 400 such sites. Efforts to eradicate these sites are just as old. AOL and Yahoo tried to ban pro-ana material that same year.

These attempts have not been successful. Rather, the “survival” of such networks has required adaptation.

In practice, this involves these networks “turning inwards”, as “subgroups of ana-mia bloggers will exchange messages, links and images among themselves and exclude other information sources”. Present estimates suggest there may be millions of pro-ana websites.

Like other online interactions, pro-ana websites have become integrated with social media.

The present legal framework

In Australia, there is little regulation of pro-ana material. There are general criminal offences that relate to causing bodily harm. This includes causing a person to have a disease or disorder. It follows that anorexia, while a mental illness, might nevertheless constitute bodily harm.

However, it is not likely that these offences will criminalise the publication of pro-ana material. The causes of anorexia are complex

The wild young man dashing madly down the highways of experience, liberated from conventional restraints and searching for sex and salvation in the American night, sent chills of horror down the spine of respectable society in 1957, when Kerouac immortalized him as Dean Moriarty in On the Road. A few years later, just when America thought it was safe to drive again, he came roaring back, in the flesh this time and crazier than ever, as the pilot of the bus Ken Kesey and his "Merry Pranksters" took cross-country in the psychedelic 60s. His mad appetite for pleasure and his speed-crazed monologues, recounted faithfully by Tom Wolfe in The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, made him a counterculture folk hero. Survivors of that era still speak and write of him with reverence.

Cassady has insinuated himself into the popular imagination beyond the wildest dreams of even his most ardent admirers. Think of the mythologized passions and highway death of James Dean, the apocalyptic persona and imagery of Jim Morrison, and the more recent road-to-the-promised-land visions of Springsteen and his various clones. Several generations of movie and TV roadrunners, from the adventure seekers on Route 66 through the postapocalyptic mutants of Road Warrior, have gotten much of their fuel from Neal at the wheel of his endless succession of gas-guzzling chariots.

Yet the "real" Cassady has remained elusive. As powerful as his personality was, he's come to seem ephemeral, an empty mirror in which everyone saw images of his or her own choosing. Even Cassady's most devoted disciples remember him selectively. Allen Ginsberg has said that Ken Babbs, a Kesey associate and an editor at Kesey's journal Spit in the Ocean, once turned down a manuscript Ginsberg submitted describing the first time he and Cassady slept together. Babbs apparently wanted nothing to interfere with his cherished image of Cassady as heroic heterosexual.

Most of the Cassady legend has consisted of fictionalized or anecdotal accounts, set in a romanticized Beat or hippie era and usually related by adoring acolytes, mostly men. Women--whether Cassady's innumerable girlfriends and three wives or female critics unimpressed by his exploits as cocksman extraordinaire--have by and large remained pointedly silent.

This may come as no surprise, given that the bill was written by 13 men.

The Affordable Care Act made several changes to improve women’s access to health care in the US. The law expanded contraceptive access, required (at long last) private small-group insurers to cover maternity care, and broadened the number of people who could access Medicaid — which pays for half of all births in this country.

These advances mattered to public health when you think about how poorly American women fare compared with women in other rich countries when it comes to several health outcomes. (We have some of the worst maternal health and mortality outcomes in the developed world, and life expectancy for women is going down.) They also gave women some relief from worrying about the cost of accessing very basic health services.

Doctors and reproductive health advocates are saying the GOP’s Senate health care bill looks like a big step backward. On Thursday, the bill was released to the public after a secretive deliberation process, and the Senate is expected to cast a vote on it next week. Here are the four key ways this bill could undermine the health of American women.

1) The bill overhauls and dramatically cuts Medicaid — which covers half of all US births

Medicaid is incredibly important for reproductive health: The program for low-income Americans pays for half of all births, including two-thirds of unplanned births. Three-quarters of the public dollars spent on family planning are Medicaid dollars, and in 17 states, Medicaid programs also cover abortion with state dollars.

The core idea behind the Better Care Act is cutting spending on health care for the poor to finance tax cuts for the rich, as Vox’s Andrew Prokop explained. In practice, this means phasing out Medicaid expansion (which made more people eligible for the program) by 2021.

But that’s only the beginning. “Once the Medicaid expansion is repealed, Republicans get to work on Medicaid itself, tying the amount it can spend to an inflation index that lags behind how much health care actually costs,” Vox’s Ezra Klein explains. This will involve converting Medicaid to a “per capita cap” system, which means states would only allot a fixed sum of money to each enrollee, instead of covering all their medical bills. “The result is Medicaid will be able to cover fewer people and cover

Legal action has also been taken against the 60 men and 114 women who were acting as brokers in the 70 cases that have been recorded since January.

With only five male victims, women made up an overwhelming majority of the victims. Past reports show that female victims are forced to become sex workers, while men are used as laborers, and children as beggars.

Despite the good news, activists feel that simply rescuing individuals from these situations is just the first step, and that more should be done to break the terrible cycle.

Tun Tun, an anti-human trafficking activist currently working in China told 7Day: “To be honest, if these individuals did this [went to China] because they couldn’t find work here, then the government needs to help create jobs for them once they’re brought back [home]. Otherwise, these people will find another illegal way to go back to China, and when they go back, they’ll also take other women with them and act as their broker.”

The majority of Myanmar victims are women who come from low-income families in remote villages. These women are promised better paying jobs by brokers, only to be sold off to Chinese farmers once they make it across the border. According to police reports, victims are ‘priced’ based on their age; women who are virgins are also priced higher than those who are not.

When the one-child policy was still in place, Chinese men would take Myanmar brides and force them to get pregnant until they gave birth to a son. One victim who spoke to the Myanmar Times in 2013 said that the men would kill the child if it was a girl.

An anti-human trafficking law was only first introduced in Myanmar in 2005. Despite increased efforts to prosecute offenders, many cases still remain unsolved.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

The prognosis is poor: by 2030, 58 per cent of Irish men are expected to be obese, topping the scale of all European countries, according to a UK-based study published last year. If you add the projected number of overweight men to the Irish total, the figure is even worse, coming in at a gut-busting 90 per cent.

Now a new review of men’s food behaviour by Safefood, the all-Ireland health body, shows that we’re well on our way to fulfilling that frightening prediction. It points out that 70 per cent of men in the Republic are currently overweight or obese, compared with 50 per cent of women, as are 69 per cent of men in the North, against 57 per cent of women.

The big question, of course, is why. What is it about living on this island that makes Irish men, in particular, stuff themselves silly, with so little regard for the health consequences?

Many reasons – from simple greed or laziness, to more complex speculations about how men respond to stress, or marriage, or whether they are especially sensitive to the effects of chemicals such as phthalates, commonly found in household products – have been forwarded for male weight gain.

Dr Aileen McGloin, from Safefood, has a list of contributing factors as long as your arm, all of which, it seems, can be summed up by one single sentence. “Men,” she says, “live in a different food world.”

A different food world? Hang on, don’t we all occupy the same universe of choices, populated by temptations like fat-laden ready-meals and sneaky snacks under the desk at work? But McGloin says that men’s experience of eating, and all that goes with it – the shopping, the preparation, the amount they actually consume – is often markedly different to how women encounter their food.

Men are more likely to eat larger portions, they’re less likely to be aware of healthy eating guidelines, and many don’t regard eating well as an important factor in their long-term health.

Is it just about complacency then? Even ignorance? McGloin isn’t keen to be so judgmental. Rather, she says, it’s a matter of cultural conditioning, right from the start.

“You have to be careful about over-generalising, but men are less likely to learn about food in childhood, so they sometimes come into adulthood without

<|begin_of_text|>ESPN Events has announced that Atlanta, Georgia-based BitPay will serve as the new title sponsor of the annual St. Petersburg Bowl — an NCAA-sanctioned post-season college football game that has been taking place since 2008.

BitPay, renowned for its business of allowing merchants to easily accept bitcoin payments and convert them instantly to local currency, will have the game known as the Bitcoin St. Petersburg Bowl beginning with this year’s game, slated to be held on the 26th of December at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida.

“Our goal is to continue to move bitcoin into the mainstream and sponsoring the St. Petersburg Bowl offers us that opportunity,” noted Mr. Tony Gallippi, Executive Chairman at BitPay. “College football fans and the bitcoin community represent a similar target demographic – tech-savvy men between the ages of 18 and 40.”

BitPay has secured the game title sponsor opportunity for three years until the December game in 2016.

Aired nationally on ESPN — a major sports network — the St. Petersburg Bowl game is watched by many sports fans (particularly those interested in football, quite obviously), and BitPay’s hoping to use the opportunity to “further promote interest in the digital currency on a national scale.”

“We’re extremely excited to welcome BitPay to college football and our bowl home in St. Petersburg,” says Brett Dulaney, who heads the St. Petersburg Bowl. “We look forward to a long and mutually beneficial arrangement.”

Previous sponsors of the St. Petersburg bowl include magicJack (voice over IP service) and Beef ‘O’ Brady’s, a sports bar/restaurant franchise.

Tickets to the game will be available via traditional channels (such as TicketMaster), but also by paying with bitcoin (this includes merchandise, too).

Bitcoin in sports

This isn’t bitcoin’s first encounter with sports.

Earlier this year, NBA team Sacramento Kings announced they would be accepting bitcoin for game tickets and merchandise. And most recently, the San Jose Earthquakes (Major League Soccer) announced they too would be accepting bitcoin — even in-stadium at concession kiosks and in their gift store.

The St. Petersburg Bowl game kicks off at 8 p.m. local time on December 26th.

Services must open combat roles to women who qualify

One test: Carrying an 85-lb. pack for 10 kilometers or more

CAMP GEIGER, N.C. — Mist clings to the ground and the sun won't make an appearance for another three hours. The 263 Marines of Delta Company, Infantry Training Battalion, shoulder their bulky packs and set off.

The air is still cool, but 85-pound packs are heavy. Soon the Marines are sweating through their camouflage uniforms and noncommissioned officers are moving between the two files of Marines, shouting encouragement and encouraging stragglers to keep up.

The Marine Corps has been training infantrymen here since 1953. This year is different. Among Delta Company's 263 Marines are 13 women who have volunteered to participate in a closely watched experiment into the feasibility of integrating females into the infantry. The infantry is among a handful of military jobs that remain male-only preserves.

The women, who are shouldering the same packs and wearing the same combat uniforms as the men, are barely distinguishable from the men as they trudge in the darkness.

"We treat everyone the same," said Staff Sgt. Billy Shinault, a Marine instructor who chatted while working a bolt of chewing tobacco after the hike. "We would be doing them a disservice to lower the standards."

Shortly before he left office earlier this year, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta ordered the military to lift the ban on women serving in ground combat specialties, such as the infantry and special operations. He left it up to the services to figure out how to put the order into effect. The services have until January 2016 to do so. Exceptions would require approval of the defense secretary.

Women have been serving in plenty of jobs that have exposed them to combat over the past decade in Iraq and Afghanistan. But ground combat jobs have remained off-limits. These jobs require physical strength, feats of endurance and spending a long time in primitive field conditions.

The infantry is the leading edge of the ground combat specialties. Its mission is as basic as it is elemental. Infantrymen carry what they need on their backs

Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) criticized attendees of President Trump’s political rallies Sunday, claiming they represent ‘spasms of a dying party.’

“When you look at some of the audiences cheering for Republicans, sometimes, you look out there and you say, ‘those are the spasms of a dying party,’ ” Flake told ABC’s “This Week.”

“When you look at the lack of diversity, sometimes, and it depends on where you are, obviously, but by and large, we’re appealing to older white men and there are just a limited number of them, and anger and resentment are not a governing philosophy,” Flake added.

Hollywood star and conservative firebrand James Woods blasted the outgoing lawmaker over his comments.

“You mean the party that has the Presidency, the House, the Senate, the Supreme Court, the majority of State Legislatures, the majority of State Governors, and is poised the steamroll over the broke Democrats in 2018, 2020, and 2024? You mean THAT dying party? #NumbskullJeffFlake?”

Ouch.

Flake made headlines recently after cutting a check for Democrat Senate-elect Doug Jones. After making the political contribution, Flake taunted conservatives by tweeting “country over party”.

The Hill reports:

Flake, who has announced he will not seek reelection in 2018, has been a frequent critic of Trump, earning the president’s ire on Twitter. The Arizona senator refused to back Republican Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, calling him unfit for office. He wrote a $100 check to Democrat Doug Jones in the race, writing “Country over Party” in the memo line.

<|begin_of_text|>I keep seeing the word "meritocracy" pop up, mostly in discussions that seem to have stemmed from Faruk Ateş' "A primer on sexism in the tech industry". Do yourself a favor, don't go googling. It's the same shit: "Sexism isn't real because I'm a woman and no one did the sexism to me!" "Women resent being treated as women instead of being evaluated solely on their capabilities!" "You're a sexist moron!" "Some people called me a sexist moron after my moronic sexist blog post and it hurt my little feelings and I'm leaving the internet!" "You GUYS, remember this is supposed to be a meritocracy."

Except no. No it fucking isn't. Because a meritocracy is not a real thing. It is a joke.

The word meritocracy comes from a political satire. It was never meant to be something we should aspire to. It was the opposite, actually, a warning about how we rationalize what we believe we've "earned". If that sentence doesn't seem to you applicable to the tech industry and our cyclical discussions about sexism, racism, and even occasionally classism, go get yourself another cup of coffee.

There's some dumb bullshit in one of the current crop of reaction posts waxing poetic about "hacker culture," and its freedom of speech and lack of PC dogma. Hacker culture was a bunch of white dudes. Hacker culture is a great example of a meritocracy. Some of the most privileged of the privileged got together and formed a community around the idea that they were smarter than everyone else. They created an arbitrary set of metrics for membership and according to their metrics, they triumphed. This was the first time in the history of the world white men had experienced the elation of peer recognition.

A meritocracy is not a system for locating and rewarding the best of the best. If it were, the "best of the best" in almost every goddamned industry or group on the planet would not be a clump of white men. I'm having trouble finding good stats on this, but white men are something like 8% of the world's population. When you go to a fucking conference and you look around at all the white dudes, do you really honestly think, "Wow! What a bizarre fucking statistical anomaly it is that basically everyone with the special magic gift of computer programming happened to be born into a teeny tiny little demographic sliver of the population"? Of course you don't.

<|begin_of_text|>Whatever else is said about the murder of 20 elementary school children in Newtown, Conn. last year, let no one say – especially at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on gun control today – that those killings were “unimaginable.” Every day, mass killings are imagined, rehearsed, and enacted – virtually – by millions of children and young adults, mostly boys and men, in violent video games. One segment of Bioshock 2, for example, invites players to kill defenseless, cowering girls (called Little Sisters) or lure them into a trap where they are mowed down by a machine gun.

Adam Lanza didn’t have to imagine the Sandy Hook massacre on his own. Others had already imagined it for him.

When Wayne LaPierre, head of the National Rifle Association, pointed a finger at video games and media violence during a news conference after the shootings, it was a calculated effort to distract attention from the gun industry and its powerful lobby. As former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and her husband Mark Kelly wrote in their USA Today op-ed announcing the launch of their gun-control superPAC, "We saw from the NRA leadership's defiant and unsympathetic response to the Newtown, Conn., massacre that winning even the most common-sense reforms will require a fight."

But Mr. LaPierre was also half right. Glock and Bushmaster give troubled teens and young adults like Lanza the means to kill. But antisocial video games and a wider culture of militarism give them the script.

What LaPierre neglected to say is that the arms industry, the video game industry, and the military are deeply entwined with one another and even, one could argue, allied in values. In many ways, their work together is eroding the distinction between virtual and real killing.

During the Iraq War, Marines relaxed after conducting search and destroy missions by playing Call of Duty 4 and CounterStrike, fielding the same weapons and tactics. CIA agents and Air Force personnel today kill real people in distant countries using remotely piloted drones, on interfaces modeled on video games, while US soldiers hone tactical combat skills on video game simulators and use Xbox joysticks to control real machines in the battlefield.

Meanwhile, the video game industry works closely with the military and gun manufacturers to ensure that their virtual weaponry, from the PM-63 submachine gun to the C-130 gunship, behaves just like the real thing. Some game companies have direct contracts with the Department of Defense, manufacturing hardware

<|begin_of_text|>OREM — A group of Brigham Young University students recently used a popular dating application to perform a social experiment on unsuspecting fellow students in Utah Valley.

Tinder, a mobile dating application for iPhones, has exploded in popularity in recent months. Users swipe through profile pictures of people near them, indicating when they are interested in another person. If the interest is mutual, the two are able to contact one another.

The app has enough of a following at BYU to have garnered an article in the school's paper about it. Its success in Provo led three BYU students to ask a question: How many men would show up to meet a girl with whom they had had only the briefest of interactions?

"We weren't sure we'd be willing to do it … We didn't think that many people would. And we were proven wrong," Bowman Bagley, a junior at the school, told the Huffington Post.

Tinder requires a Facebook profile to log in, so Bagley and his roommates set up an account for a fake 21-year-old named Sammy. They uploaded a few photos taken from Miss Teen USA Kendall Fein's online profile and spent an hour "liking" every guy the app showed them.

About 250 people were matched with "Sammy," and the roommates messaged each of them about a potential date.

"I'm going to yogurt shop called yogurtland tonight at 9 in orem with some girl friends if you want to meet up ;)" Sammy wrote.

What happened was something no one expected: about six dozen men showed up at the frozen yogurt shop to meet the fictional young woman. What happened next was described on the blog of a student with a connection to Bagley:

"We walked toward the door to see groups and groups and groups of guys getting out of their cars, hustling into the building. I could not believe it! They were swarming! Literally swarming!" the blogger, who describes herself as a friend of a friend of Bagley's, wrote.

"Some were waiting outside, trying to look casual.... Some groups were standing together, looking around, looking cool… Picture a wall full of men standing in a yogurt shop on a Thursday night, with no intent of tasting the yogurt," she continued.

Bagley told the Huffington Post by the time he deleted the fake profile two days later, he had received multiple messages from those he had fooled — some who had missed out on Yogurtland and wanted to make it up on

Female graduates earn thousands of pounds less than their male counterparts, according to a report.

The pay gap persists even between men and women from the same types of university who studied the same subjects, suggests the study.

Researchers for the Higher Education Careers Services Unit (Hecsu) analysed how much students who applied to higher education in 2006, earned last year.

Jane Artess, of Hecsu, said pay distribution was "strikingly uneven".

This was despite laws designed to ensure equal access to jobs and pay, said Ms Artess,

The researchers analysed data from a longitudinal study of 17,000 recent graduates called Futuretrack. They found that the take-home pay of more than half of female graduates ranged between £15,000 and £23,999.

Male lead

Men were more likely to take home £24,000 and above, they found.

The analysis did not include part-time workers or the unemployed.

The data, published in the Hecsu journal Graduate Market Trends, suggested men earned more than women across all degree subject areas, even if more women took those subjects than men.

"When graduate earnings are examined by subject, it is clear that women earned less than men who studied the same subject," says the article.

The authors add this is the case across all subject areas, "even where women's participation is greater than men's".

"Equal opportunity to access jobs and pay has been enshrined in legislation for 40 years, yet Futuretrack found that being female can make a difference to a graduate's earning power", said Ms Artess.

"It is difficult to see why this is, for example, female graduates of media-related subjects are no more or less numerous than their male counterparts yet their earnings are typically lower.

"Of the Futuretrack respondents, there were fewer men than women in law, yet there is an even greater male lead on earnings.

"Since it would be unlawful for employers to pay males and females doing the same job differently, something else must be happening to female graduate earnings.

"If we look at wages by sector, the male lead is persistent in the public and private sectors, in graduate workplaces and also in graduate and non-graduate job roles.

"The only area where female pay is equal to males is in the not-for-profit sector," said Ms Artess.

Trades Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O'Grady described the findings as "very alarming."

Field Notes explores Honolulu’s vast and varied scenes and subcultures. This month we meet the guys who make money playing video games.

WHAT THEY DO

Last October, 40,000 people packed Sangam Stadium in Seoul to watch two teams compete for a $1 million prize. The event? The League of Legends world championship tournament, complete with rock bands, orchestra and fireworks. Multiplayer online gaming is huge worldwide, but nowhere bigger than South Korea, where Chung-Ang University even awards scholarships to top video gamers.

Honolulu’s equivalent scene lives primarily at a 2,100-square-foot storefront in ‘Aiea, run by Devin Wolery. With the help of a small, active core of employees, PC Gamerz puts on e-sport tournaments at his LAN Center. That’s LAN, as in local area network, which guarantees speedy gameplay by keeping the network small. That’s valuable in games where milliseconds mean the difference between winning and losing.

Tournaments are held at the ‘Aiea storefront, in the corner of the Ala Moana Microsoft Store and, twice a year, at Hot Import Nights. Teams of four or five sit next to each other, staring at high-definition computer monitors and shouting enemy positions in shorthand that is unintelligible to the uninitiated.

Wolery, 31 years old, with spiked hair and black-rimmed glasses, has been the driving force in building the local professional gaming scene. When he was 18, Wolery got kicked out of his charter school in Sacramento, Calif. for hacking into his school’s computers. He was unimpressed by their computer security. “The password was ‘charter’ spelled backwards,” he says. After moving to Hawai‘i, he started working 40 hours a week at Circuit City and spending another 40 hours a week playing video games. His father noticed, opened PC Gamerz and put Wolery in charge. Now, he’s running video-game tournaments that draw in a diverse group of 20-something-year-old men.

THE GAMES

The most popular game, by far, is League of Legends. Wolery says players log 9,000 hours of the game each month at his store (compared to 1,200 hours for the next three games combined). In the game, players control one of dozens of “champions,” characters with different attributes and attacks. Five-man teams battle each

Photograph by Paul Zimmerman/Getty Images.

One evening in the spring of 1999, Marissa Mayer got a recruiting email from a tiny search company. “I was in a long-distance relationship at the time, so I was pathetically eating a bad bowl of pasta in my dorm room by myself on a Friday night,” she once told me. Mayer was then a computer science graduate student at Stanford, and she’d been getting bombarded with offers from some of the world’s biggest tech firms. “I remember I’d told myself, ‘New emails from recruiters—just hit delete.’ ” But Mayer found Google interesting. She’d heard about the firm from one of her professors, and her graduate work—she’d been building a recommendation algorithm for Web pages—meshed with the company’s technological aims.

On the day Mayer interviewed at Google, the company only had seven employees. Most of them were software engineers, and all of the engineers were men. Google’s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, saw that Mayer would fit right in to the geeky boys’ club (during the interview, they all chatted about a data-analysis method known as k-means clustering), and they quickly offered her a job. Mayer, though, wasn’t instantly sold.

“I had to think really hard about how to choose between job offers,” she said. Mayer approached the choice analytically. Over spring break, she studied the most successful choices in her life to figure out what they had in common. “I looked across very diverse decisions—everything from deciding where to go to school, what to major in, how to spend your summers—and I realized that there were two things that were true about all of them,” she said. “One was, in each case, I’d chosen the scenario where I got to work with the smartest people I could find. … And the other thing was I always did something that I was a little not ready to do. In each of those cases, I felt a little overwhelmed by the option. I’d gotten myself in a little over my head.”

After weighing her options, Mayer chose Google. After an amazingly successful 13 years with the company, where she oversaw the look and feel of some of the company’s most high-profile products, she’s decided to move on. On Monday, Mayer announced that she’s going to become the new CEO of Yahoo. (She also revealed that she’s pregnant.)

<|begin_of_text|>Distraught that women are outpacing men in college enrollments, Eagle Forum founder Phyllis Schlafly took to WorldNetDaily this week to float the idea that colleges should enforce a gender quota to even out admissions to the benefit of men. Responding to a 2010 New York Times article, Schlafly wondered if colleges should set male admissions quotas to ensure that student bodies are “half women and half men.”

Another proposal Schlafly put in the mix is to “stop granting college loans, thereby forcing students to take jobs to pay for their tuition and eliminate time for parties, perhaps even wiping out time for fraternities and sororities.”

Schlafly also called for colleges to stop enforcing Title IX, which prevents sex discrimination in education, as a way to attract men, alleging that the anti-discrimination measure “removes a primary motivation for young men to go to college, many of whom want to try out for a sport even if they are not good enough to make the team.”

All of this, the right-wing activist insists, would actually benefit women because it would give them more available men to date.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Medieval sports were, for the most part, chances for men to practice their martial skills in less dangerous and destructive ways, and largely relegated women to the role of cheerleaders on the sidelines. There was one sport, however, that welcomed both men and women to the field (literally): falconry.

Rooted in the ancient world, falconry was used for necessary hunting in the Middle Ages – such as finding food and killing vermin – but it was also an extremely popular sport for the nobility. Falcons and hawks were usually trained to hunt small prey, like rabbits and other birds, as they do in the natural world, but their training was sometimes expanded to include attacking larger prey, like deer, in order to weaken and distract the animals so that hunters and their dogs could finish them off (Stuhmiller, p.701). Unlike boar and stag hunting, falconry did not involve a face-to-face encounter with a dangerous and panicked animal, so it was a much safer sport for respectable medieval ladies to participate in: less physically demanding, less rushed, and less bloody.

There was a wide range of birds for medieval people to train and use to hunt, including the gyrfalcon, goshawk, and sparrowhawk. A common bird for ladies to hunt with, though, was the peregrine falcon, and not just because grey goes with everything. Peregrines were a good choice for ladies because they are relatively small, therefore lighter to hold on the fist, and they are especially graceful in the air. Peregrines attack their prey by closing their talons into fists and diving, breaking the bones of other birds and knocking them out of the sky. This means that these falcons don’t often have the bloody, feather-shredding battles that some other raptors do (which could also be why some medieval men preferred the drama of hunting with bigger hawks). In order to accomplish this backbreaking feat, peregrines execute spectacular dives in excess of 300 kmph – they are the fastest creatures on the planet. Pretty awesome accessories for medieval ladies to wear on their arms, if you ask me.

Because falconry allowed for women and men to spend the day riding sedately out into nature and having picnic lunches in full view of dozens of chaperones, it was the perfect opportunity – and excuse – for them to flirt and get to know each other. Soon enough, falconry became inextricably linked to romance, and no

<|begin_of_text|>Bisexuality is the tendency to be sexually attracted to both men and women. To some, this may sound like a superpower doubling one's romantic options (and odds). But in real life, bisexuality can be an awkward to have, creating a challenge truly fitting in with either the “straight" or LGBT communities.

But most important, bisexuality tends to be quite misunderstood.

Myths and stereotypes about bisexuality abound, some even contradicting one another. Straight and LGBT people alike can hold such stereotypes, compounding the difficulties bisexual people can have fitting in. Luckily, an increasing number of researchers have been producing research improving our of bisexuality.

Here are three examples of how science has worked to combat misconceptions about bisexuality:

Myth 1: "There's no such thing as bisexuality."

This is especially laughable. How can you tell a group of individuals that they don’t exist? But the idea that all people have to be either straight or gay is pervasive and persistent, especially when it comes to men. Frustratingly, even within the most LGBT-friendly circles, you encounter the idea that “there’s no such thing as a bisexual man.”

Researchers have quite clearly laid this myth to rest with a study recently published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior(1). Researchers recruited straight, gay, and bisexual men, and exposed them to a variety of erotic film clips. Not only were participants asked to rate their subjective feelings of arousal in response to the clips, they were also connected to physiological equipment that measured changes in genital arousal. As would be expected, heterosexual men responded with much more subjective and genital arousal to films containing women rather than men, and vice versa for gay men. However, bisexual men were aroused relatively similarly by videos of both men and women. They were also more aroused by bisexual clips—for example, two men and one woman—than were the other two groups. Importantly, these differences were in both their reported arousal and the objective measurement of their genital arousal. It is clear from this study that these individuals were not “pretending” to be bisexual.

Myth 2: "Bisexuality is just a phase."

With this myth, bisexuality is represented as a state of experimentation or confusion—stereotypically experienced during the college years—that occurs before a person settles on their “true” identity.

Lisa Diamond has conducted some very sophisticated work on this topic, in which she examined the sexual identities of women over long periods of time. In a

Echo might serve as a kind of Grant and Glueck Study for denizens of virtual communities—a longevity survey that can tell us something about the future of the larger social networks that followed it. How has Echo evolved and changed as its members have moved through life? Does online community mean something different to them, 30 years on?

OR 2) Without ECHO I’d have no friends (or life) at all, because really I was never going to bother hanging out with anyone in “real life” anyway.

* * *

When Echo was created, the internet was just beginning to be touted as cool. It was before MySpace or Friendster, before Amazon, before the World Wide Web. There was still no faith that the internet had any commercial potential, and Echo’s founder, Stacy Horn, a former telecommunications analyst at Mobil, failed to attract investors to her project, and had to start it with her life savings of $20,000. For the first few years, it was run from her fifth-floor walk-up apartment; for a while, it graduated to a swanky Tribeca office, but it’s back in Horn’s living room today.

At its peak, Echo had 2,000 members. Forty percent of them were women, a considerable achievement in an era when somewhere around 90 percent of internet users were men. Twice a month, everyone was invited to a real-life Echo party, and all the people who came could fit into one medium-sized Manhattan bar.

Horn wasn’t just the owner, but a daily participant, talking openly about her personal problems, her favorite TV shows, what she had for lunch. She dated several Echoids, including my husband, who dated at least a dozen others. The atmosphere was incestuous, intimate, intense. At 3 a.m., despairing Echoids would log in to share their existential doubts; at 3 p.m., they’d talk about the conversation they had at

Women are watching, writing, acting in and making sci fi and fantasy – and, if you believe the men behind the "Fake Geek Girls" movement, they’re just doing it for male attention.

When graphic novelist Tony Harris posted an angry screed on Facebook, decrying the conventionally pretty women who attend conventions in the hopes of snaring an unsuspecting young nerd to toy with, the fake geek girl meme went viral. Harris was simply repeating an argument that has been doing the rounds for years – the "booth babes" and scantily-clad fangirls are there not because they genuinely like science fiction, but to attract men they’d normally never look twice at. One of the biggest targets has been cosplay – what the non-nerdy might term "dressing up". Whilst male fans are free to show up dressed as the Dark Knight himself, attend a con in Catwoman’s leathers and you must be doing it for male attention. A man can wear a bow tie and a fez and he’s in costume. A woman can spend hundreds of pounds or weeks of her time on an exact replica of an outfit a minor character wore onscreen for five minutes, whilst reciting the Prime Directive in Klingon, and she’s an attention-seeking slut. For a subculture that prides itself on individuality, that sounds an awful lot like mainstream misogyny.

Geekdom is a competitive sphere, whatever your gender. Obscure facts become currency, traded for acceptance or a place in the hierarchy. Fans who come on board at the height of a show’s popularity are looked down upon, because they don’t know the pain of living through those arid, TARDIS-less years between McCoy and Eccleston with only Paul McGann to alleviate the tedium. Women in particular are seen as jumping on a bandwagon, appropriating geek chic – just like female football fans, they’re only interested in the hero’s physique.

Women’s engagement with media has always been trivialised, from the eighteenth century scorn heaped upon novels to the dismissal of teenage boyband fans, whose attention, it is assumed, must be on the floppy-haired singers, not the music itself.

In a world full of Safe Spaces, Trigger warnings, Gender Wage Gaps and Racists. There is one thing the liberal fucktard left will shove in our faces, DIVERSITY.

The left believes they are Diversity masters because they took a gender studies class (Or as I call it a waste of money class). and hate Cis-gender, Heterosexual, White Men.

One thing they forgot about Diversity is Diversity of opinions. The diversity of beliefs, Diversity of Speech and Diversity of actions.

I can’t attend one of these diversity groups (Not that I want to) because I call Myself a Faggot who supports Trump, I don’t believe the USA is inherently racist, I don’t believe we are all Homophobic and most of all I am perceived as White.

Black, RugMunching, feminist Trannies are their idea of Diversity.

The left preaches what they don’t even have a grip on. Right wing conservatives (or as they like to call us Old white men that don’t care about Women, LGBT or Blacks) are better than Liberals at Diversity. They have this radical notion that diversity is who they pick and choose based on Skin color, Family, political orientation, and beliefs.

This idea of Diversity is the basis of Authoritarianism. Selective participation based on the ideas of the leaders, Similar to North Korea where you are assigned a job, a Haircut and you are told to have the same beliefs as your leaders or you and your family will be persecuted.

But I’m allegedly just a white supremacist, Patriarchy contributor, and Woman hater. No, I just prefer men. FUCK. Can’t I have a preference?

For a transgender teenager, something as simple as going to the loo at school can be a huge stress.

So two Wellington schools are leading a dunny revolution: fitting gender-neutral bathrooms for students who feel uncomfortable using'male' or 'female' bathrooms.

Wellington High School has transformed its level 4 boys' bathroom into, well, just a bathroom.

And Onslow College is soon to follow suit, spending tens of thousands converting an old block of girls' toilets into gender-neutral facilities.

* Opinion: New Zealand needs gender-neutral loos and changing rooms

* American school adopts gender-neutral bathrooms

The schools join a global trend of schools and cities moving towards bathrooms that are not set up specifically for men or women.

"Some people don't identify with male or female fully, so it's hard for those people not feeling they can go into one of those bathrooms," said Wellington High School student Rose MacKenzie.

The 15-year-old said she had sometimes avoided using bathrooms in public, not knowing which to choose

"If I go into one I know I'll be told this is the female bathroom, but if I go into the other I might receive threats because of, you know, what I look like," she said.

MacKenzie is a member of Wellington High's UltraViolet club, representing LGBTQI+ students, which - led by student Ed Smith, 16 - raised the issue with the school board.

Deputy principal Andrew Savage said UltraViolet put together a comprehensive proposal on how the urinals could be converted, with sanitary bins put in each cubicle, and the sign outside changed to simply read 'bathroom'.

"The board of trustees listened to what the need was and within a short amount of time it was all done and dusted. It's kind of a boring story, in a good way," he laughed.

"The sky didn't fall in, there was no Erin Brockovich moment, it was very straight-forward."

Onslow College is also about to convert one block of girls' toilets into gender-neutral stalls, after its LGBTQI+ group Club Sandwich took the idea to staff.

"It's all about respecting diversity and meeting the needs of diversity, and I think it is the way to go," principal Peter Leggat said.

<|begin_of_text|>Four years after the sleeper hit Pyaar Ka Punchnama detailed the travails of three harried men and their harridan women, writer and director Luv Ranjan is back with a new set of adventures about three harried men and their harridan women.

Now, as then, three flatmates acquire girlfriends and live to rue the day. Siddharth (Sunny Singh Nijar) becomes butler, driver and handyman to his beloved Supriya (Sonalli Sehgall), who cannot bring herself to tell her family that she loves him. Tarun (Omkar Kapoor) and Kusum (Ishita Sharma) appear to be a perfect match until she starts maxing out his credit cards and interfering with his business plans. Anshul (Karthik Aaryan) adores the flitty Ruchika (Nushrat Bharucha), but she treats him like one of her designer handbags and loves her male BFF more.

Except for Nijar and Kapoor, all the other actors are repeats from the first film. Anshul and Ruchika were also paired in the original, and though they are new characters here, their many lows and fleeting highs are all too familiar. Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2 could have revisited their relationship, but it would have meant making Ruchika more human and less of a screeching stereotype – not a prospect entertained by this cautionary tale of male emasculation, which doubles up as a call to arms for men in the ongoing battle of the sexes.

What appears to have changed since 2011 is the budget for sets and costumes. The trio's apartment is a marked upgrade from the crummy digs featured in the first film. Ruchika is straight out of a fashion magazine catalogue and furiously pouts and preens, waves her painted talons about, and has a closet packed with minuscule dresses. When the couples decide to head out on an ill-advised vacation together, they fly to Thailand. The first movie was happy to swell the ranks of Goan tourists.

Die, women, die!

The economy might have improved, but the value system remains stuck in a mythical golden past when men dictated the rules of sexual engagement. The screenplay proceeds as a series of sketches and anecdotes. Some of them are funny enough, but each makes the same point as the first film: modern men are treated like dogs by women (a song to this effect is borrowed from part one),

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) stood with his Democratic colleagues in the Senate on Monday night to "hold the floor" as a way to draw attention to Republicans efforts to rush through their Trumpcare legislation under cover of darkness.

Critics of the Republicans say their repeal and replace bill is nothing more than a massive tax break for the wealthy that would also strip healthcare coverage from millions of Americans while making it worse for nearly everyone.

As Sanders tweeted: "The truth is that this is not a 'health care' bill. This is a 'tax breaks for the rich and multinational corporations' bill." And: "This health care bill will impact millions and millions of Americans. Yet we have not had one hearing. Republicans should be embarrassed."

Outside groups like MoveOn.org, Indivisible, and Planned Parenthood Action have all been rallying against the Republican plan and urging Democrats to escalate their opposition.

"Congress wants to take away our health care—we can't let it happen," said Planned Parenthood Action in a message to its members on Monday. And Indivisible tweeted: "By shutting down the Senate, @ SenateDems are drawing more attention to the secrecy and speed with which the GOP's # TrumpCare is moving."

"What are you afraid of?" Sanders asked Senate Republicans during his remarks on the floor late Monday night. "Healthcare constitutes one-sixth of the U.S. economy. It impacts every man, woman, and child in our nation and yet we have thirteen Republicans—all men—working behind closed doors to produce legislation that will be brought to the United States Senate at the last moment so the American people won't know the disaster that it is."

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said Monday it was obvious that "Republicans are writing their healthcare bill under the cover of darkness because they are ashamed of it."

During his remarks from the Senate floor Monday night, Schumer challenged Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to reconsider efforts to rush the bill towards a vote ahead of the upcoming July 4th recess. If Republicans refuse to relent, however, Schumer said Democrats would do everything in their power to hinder McConnell's "dark" and "hidden" process.

"This radical departure from normal procedure on a bill of such consequence leaves the Senate minority little choice but to depart from normal procedure as well," Schumer said.

The majority are nominated via a top-down process and elected by a small fraction of NRA members. A breakdown of the current board, based on their official bios:

87 percent are men. 93 percent are white.

25 percent are current or former federal, state, or local lawmakers or officials.

22 percent are current or former law enforcement officers. 30 percent are current or former members of the military.

24 percent are lawyers.

12 percent are entertainers or athletes.

64 percent are hunters. 71 percent are sport or competitive shooters.

At least 71 percent were nominated, endorsed, or selected by the NRA’s Nominating Committee.

In lieutenant governor candidate Dan Patrick’s self portrait, he is a Christian first, a conservative second and a Republican third. The one notable descriptive omission is the geographic boundary that binds the Texas electorate: “Texan.” Despite what often feels like a statewide embrace of “Texas exceptionalism,” many here appear to eschew what others practically deem a birthright: the ability to call oneself a Texan. If polling data is any indication, the proportion of Texas voters who view themselves as Texans is smaller than one might think, but is likely to grow in the coming decades.

In the February 2014 University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll, we asked respondents whether they considered themselves Texans first and Americans second, or Americans first and Texans second. Overall, just over a quarter of registered voters — 27 percent — considered themselves to be Texans first.

Democrats and liberals overwhelmingly identify as Americans before they identify as Texans (84 percent and 92 percent respectively), and while majorities of Republicans and conservatives identify as Americans first, significant proportions (35 percent and 36 percent respectively) identify first as Texans. This difference is a probable reflection of the current Republican statewide dominance and, in turn, each voter’s willingness to identify with the state.

The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.

The Texas-first crowd also includes more men than women. While 32 percent of men describe themselves as Texans first, only 23 percent of women make the same choice.

Looking to the future, it’s possible that those identifying as Texans will grow. The members of the racial/ethnic group most likely to describe themselves as Texans first are not, in fact, Anglos, among whom 27 percent describe themselves as Texans, but are instead the growing population of Hispanics, among whom 33 percent identify as Texan first.

Maybe even more surprising, younger voters are more inclined to call themselves Texans first. A slight majority of those who identify as Texans first are between the ages of 18 and 44 years old. Among 18- to 29-year-olds, 40 percent identify as Texans before they identify as Americans, far outpacing any other age group. It’s not grandpa that places the Lone Star over the Stars and Stripes, but his grandchildren.

Texas already has a regular front-row seat in the fight over federal-state power, and Texans generally consider their government to be a model for other states to follow. While it might be convenient to believe that the most Texan people in Texas are distributed around the VA halls,

They solve clues (e.g. “caught some Z’s”) and place the answers (e.g. “slept”) in a grid. Meanwhile, a separate group of wordsmiths gather regularly to compete at Scrabble, the game that involves forming words out of letter tiles and finding a suitable place for them on the board.

Both sets of players have exceptional abilities, but how exactly do they differ from each other and from non-players of matched academic ability? Some answers are provided by Michael Toma and his colleagues, who have performed the first detailed comparison of the mental skills of the most elite crossword and Scrabble players in the US. Previous studies on gaming expertise have mostly involved chess players, so this is a refreshing new research angle.

Toma’s team recruited 26 elite Scrabble players (in the top two per cent of competitive players, on average; 20 men) and 31 elite crossword players (in the top 7 per cent, on average; 22 men) to complete several tests of working memory – the kind of memory that we use to juggle and use information over short time-scales.

For example, there was a visuospatial task that involved judging whether images were symmetrical, while also remembering highlighted locations in a series of grids that always appeared after each symmetry image. Another challenge was the reading span task (a test of verbal working memory), which involved judging the grammatical sense of sentences, while also remembering the order of individual letters that were flashed on-screen after each grammatical challenge.

The researchers anticipated that the Scrabble players would outperform the crossworders on visuospatial working memory, whereas they thought the crossword players might be superior on verbal working memory. These predictions were based on the contrasting skills demanded by the two games. Scrabble players often spend hours learning lists of words that are legal in the game, but unlike crossword players, they don’t need to know their meaning. In fact many Scrabble players admit to not knowing the meaning of many of the words they play. On the other hand, Scrabble players need skills to rearrange letters and to find a place for their words on the board (a visuospatial skill), whereas crossword players do not need these skills so much because the grid is prearranged for them.

The researchers actually uncovered no group differences on any of the measures of visuospatial and verbal working memory. However, in line with predictions

Variety reports that Sorkin appeared on a panel Saturday at the Writers Guild Festival, moderated by film critic Elvis Mitchell. It appears he was astounded by the notion that white men receive more second chances when they make just so-so movies, when women and minorities find it difficult to even make that first film:

“Are you saying that women and minorities have a more difficult time getting their stuff read than white men and you’re also saying that [white men] get to make mediocre movies and can continue on?” he asked the audience.

Throughout the discussion Sorkin returned to this baffling notion, though he insisted that Hollywood is a meritocracy and that he has been unaware of any diversity issue. “You’re saying that if you are a woman or a person of color, you have to hit it out of the park in order to get another chance?” Sorkin demanded, perhaps hoping everyone would see he was speaking truth to power.

Mitchell apparently joked that Sorkin was making the common mistake of confusing “meritocracy with meretricious,” but to no avail. Sorkin was quick to remind everyone that Lena Dunham and Jordan Peele exist. There’s no report of how Sorkin came around, but he eventually offered to “help” with the diversity issues he just sort of agreed to acknowledge:

“What can I do [to help]?” Sorkin said. “I do want to understand what someone like me can do … but my thing has always been: ‘If you write it, they will come.’”

CJ Ciaramella is a reporter at the Washington Free Beacon and a contributor to Vice.

If the past 10 years have taught us anything, it’s that, one way or another, the TSA is going to get at your crotch. The latest data point comes from Denver, courtesy of CBS4:

A CBS4 investigation has learned that two Transportation Security Administration screeners at Denver International Airport have been fired after they were discovered manipulating passenger screening systems to allow a male TSA employee to fondle the genital areas of attractive male passengers.

Apparently, the two screeners, one male and the other female, worked out a system. The female screener operating the body scanner would misidentify attractive men as women on the scanner, so that the machine would flag the extra, uh, bulk in their groin area, which then initiated a pat-down from her partner in lechery.

I once had a similar experience at a TSA checkpoint. I had thoroughly emptied my pockets, but the body scanner nevertheless detected an object in my pants. Fortunately, my TSA agent did not appear to take any pleasure in the business and went about his duty with grim professionalism.

At the time, I was merely annoyed at the inconvenience, not to mention the poor performance of the taxpayer-funded $170,000 millimeter wave scanner that I had assumed was able to tell the difference between a brick of C-4 and genitals. It turns out those scanners have never stopped a terrorist, but maybe one day the TSA screeners will inadvertently catch a cute jihadist.

It’s a sign of just how resigned we’ve become to the TSA’s existence that most of the men getting felt up probably shrugged it off and thought, “Well, that’s the TSA for you.” We’ve become desensitized to being scanned and prodded and told our toothpaste is too large and must therefore be confiscated in the name of national security. TSA’s expansion of its PreCheck program and an announcement that it would stop searching black women’s hair for weapons are what pass for progress.

This is a raw deal. The federal government heaped a mountain of farcical security measures on the American public after 9/11, and now we’re supposed to give them a thumbs up for no longer taking nude photos of us and stealing pregnant ladies’ insulin.

Mind you, this is an agency that regularly employs kleptos and perverts, an agency that handed out security badges to

The latest figures show that while the number of instructors who’ve fulfilled a state-approved teacher education program is slightly up this year, the percentage of certified teachers in relation to total teaching positions statewide fell slightly to 92 percent from 93 percent the year before.

Out of the total 13,320 teaching positions as of October, 12,309 positions by the start of this school year were filled by certified teachers. That means 1,011 positions in Hawaii schools statewide are being filled by emergency hires or long-term substitutes.

Last school year, 12,268 certified teachers filled a total 13,188 positions, meaning there were 920 positions occupied by emergency hires or long-term subs.

The latest figures reflect a bit of a setback for Hawaii education officials, who have long been contending with a teacher shortage in the state in addition to weak retention levels as measured at the five-year mark.

Cory Lum/Civil Beat

Hawaii’s Department of Education wants to fill 96 percent of its teacher positions with certified teachers by 2020 as part of its long-range strategic plan. The number of certified teachers in place by the start of each school year is one of 14 indicators of student success outlined in that plan.

The figures were presented to the Hawaii Board of Education by DOE administrators, relying on a new data tool that further breaks out these figures by the 15 complex areas statewide.

The percentage of certified teachers ranges widely across the state — only 84 percent of teachers in the Nanakuli-Waianae complex are certified, for instance, compared with 96 percent in Hilo-Waiakea on Big Island.

Certified teachers in Hawaii must have at least a bachelor’s degree and have completed a state-approved teacher training program plus other requirements.

Education officials also released the number of qualified instructors in special education classrooms. Out of the 2,151 special ed teaching positions this year, 1,840 are filled by certified instructors, meaning 311 spots, or 14 percent of the total positions, are occupied by those not trained in this area.

That percentage is about level with last year’s numbers, but disparities across each complex area are much starker. In Nanakuli-Waianae, for instance, only 73 percent of special education teachers in that region are certified.

When it comes to teacher retention at the five-year mark, 54 percent

<|begin_of_text|>i once spoke to a roomful of teenagers on priorities. i shared this story (which i believe originated with stephen covey):

a university professor was addressing his new group of business students and, to drive home a point, used an illustration those students will never forget. as he stood in front of the group of high-powered overachievers he said, “okay, time for a quiz” and he pulled out a one-gallon, mason jar and set it on the table in front of him. he also produced about a dozen fist-sized rocks and carefully placed them, one at a time, into the jar.

when the jar was filled to the top and no more rocks would fit inside, he asked, “is this jar full?”

everyone in the class yelled, “yes.”

the professor replied with a little smile, “really?”

he reached under the table and pulled out a bucket of gravel. he dumped some gravel in and shook the jar causing pieces of gravel to work themselves down into the spaces between the big rocks. then, he asked the group once more, “is the jar full?”

by this time the class was on to him. “probably not,” one of them answered.

“good!” he replied. he reached under the table and brought out a bucket of sand. he started dumping the sand in the jar and it went into all of the spaces left between the rocks and the gravel. once more he asked the question, “is this jar full?”

“no!” the class shouted. this time, he said, “well done.” then he grabbed a pitcher of water and began to pour it in until the jar was filled to the brim. then he looked at the class and asked, “can anyone tell me the point of this illustration?”

one student in the front row raised his hand and said, “the point is, no matter how full your schedule is, if you try really hard you can always fit some more things in it!”

“no,” the speaker replied, “that’s not the point.” the truth this illustration teaches us is: if you don’t put the big rocks in first, you’ll never get them in at all.

what then, are the ‘big rocks’ in your life? since becoming minimalist, we have been able to identify the big rocks in our lives — our kids, our friends, our faith, our goals, and our influence. becoming minimalist is about identifying the big rocks, putting them in the jar, and intentionally eliminating the little rocks.

Updated

Sex discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick says the lack of women in Parliament has a direct impact on major issues affecting women.

Speaking on International Women's Day, Ms Broderick says she supports any measure that would boost the number of women in Parliament.

"We absolutely need power to be shared in the Parliament between men and women," she told ABC local radio.

"There is an assumption well-educated Australian women will just trickle into positions of power. We know it's not true.

"What we do still need is some active intervention."

Her comments come after Liberal Party backbencher Sharman Stone said the party should introduce mandatory quotas to boost the number of women in Parliament.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been criticised for only having one woman in his Cabinet, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop.

The Labor Party has long had a quota system in place but is yet to achieve its target of women in 40 per cent of seats.

Dr Stone has suggested the Liberals look to Labor for ideas about how to get women into politics.

"We've got to be, I think, much more structured about making sure women come through," Dr Stone said.

"I don't care about that 'tokenism' label; bring it on if you must."

Women should have greater role in Parliament: Broderick

According to Ms Broderick, women make up just one third of Australian parliamentarians.

"I think it's important that women's voices are heard at the highest level," she said.

She says the lack of women in Parliament has a direct impact on issues such as domestic violence, working conditions for women, their leadership roles and pay equality.

Ms Broderick is calling on men to use their power to help achieve gender equality in Australia.

She says that while progress was achieved last year in a number of areas, more men need to advocate for women's rights.

"Power in a country like Australia, in fact any country in the world, largely sits in the hands of men," she said.

"And if we want to create change, we need good, decent men taking the message of gender equality to other men.

"That's what's going to create change in countries."

Men stepping up support but more advocacy needed

The sex discrimination commissioner says men have stepped up their support in recent times but more advocacy is needed.

"I think the real shift we saw in the last year was we had more men getting on board, stepping up and being prepared to do some strong advocacy around gender equality and that

Imer’s mother is running the campaign field office in Jefferson County, Colorado, which includes the suburbs of Denver, and her 12-year-old son became such a big supporter of “The Donald” that he quickly became as active as his mom.

Weston is the co-chair for the Jefferson County campaign and is working to coordinate volunteers and get-out-the-vote efforts in the region.

Like so many other young Trump supporters, Imer was bullied in school for supporting the billionaire, but rather than shying away from politics he doubled down.

In an interview with KMOV 4, Imer said that he hopes to launch his own career in politics and maybe even have his own run for the presidency one day.

“Definitely, 2040, watch for me,” the 12-year-old told KMOV 4 on Sunday. “And Barron Trump if you’re watching, in 2040 I’ll take you as my running mate.”

Imer’s mom said that she hopes other parents see her son and decide to get their own children more educated and active in politics, regardless of party affiliation.

<|begin_of_text|>This weekend's Denver ComicCon came under fire when attendees discovered that a Women in Comics panel had only male panelists. While a representative of DCC has defended the panel as "not about current women creators or anything to do with industry bias," it seems odd that a convention with Trina Robbins, the eminent historian of women as creators and characters, as a guest would not invite her to join in on a discussion of the history of women in comics. While the misstep here is primarily on the panel organizers, it also raises a question of what obligation conventions have to moderate and comment on panels that are accepted.

Convention attendee Christy had this to say about what occurred at the panel:

Christy's last point is an important one --- if these guys are experts, as posited below, how could they possibly not know any women in comics to speak on this panel? Jason Jansky of DStreet PR responded to my email to Denver ComicCon to offer this statement:

In regards to the Women in Comics panel, I think it’s important to point out that it was a panel that took an historical view of women characters in comic books rather than the current role of women creators in the industry or diversity in comics --- of which DCC has many with appropriately diverse panels. The Women in Comics panel was a submitted panel that featured respected academics on the subject. A reading of the panel description indicates that the panel was not about current women creators or anything to do with industry bias. “With the female interest in comics increasing lately, this panel discusses many of the popular female characters from the beginning of the superhero mid 1930s comics. Also a focus on some of the women that were able to break in the mostly all male club of creating comics during that time. Includes an introduction to many of the female illustrators/creators attending the convention.

There are a lot of problems to unpack here, with probably the worst being that a convention representative thinks it's okay to have only men speaking for and about women simply because a panel wasn't about current women in comics, diversity, or bias. And even the former part of that is clearly incorrect, given that part of the panel description is that it would introduce attendees to women attending the convention.

The statement that the panel featured "respected academics on the subject" is also a huge problem,
