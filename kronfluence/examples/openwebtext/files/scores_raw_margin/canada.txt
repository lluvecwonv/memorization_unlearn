The proliferation of mega-churches might indicate that non-denominational Protestant evangelical Christianity is the answer, but it�s not. In fact, that group is shrinking and now represents fewer than half of Americans for the first time. It�s not Catholicism, or Mormonism, or even Islam either.

It�s None of the Above.

In 1990, about 7 percent of Americans indicated that they had no religious affiliation, according to a study last year by the University of California at Berkeley. By 2013, that figure had risen to about 20 percent.

Just to clarify, that figure doesn�t mean one out of every five people in this country had up and gone atheist. But it does indicate that a whole lot of people have become untethered from mainstream Christianity over the past two decades.

And it�s fast appearing that some of Christianity�s biggest boosters are to blame for its decline.

The alliance between Christianity and conservative politics is now so pervasive that it�s difficult to believe there was a time the two entities weren�t linked.

In fact, the first U.S. president to publicly admit having been a �born-again Christian� was one James Earl Carter, who was, politically speaking, more liberal than the so-called �Kenyan Muslim radical socialist� currently occupying the White House.

But by 1980, U.S. Christian religious leaders had fully thrown in with the Republican political right. And the arrangement has worked out pretty well for both sides ever since. At least until now.

In the past year, a whole host of polls and studies, including a poll of millennials, the hip new term to describe people born between the early 1980s and the early 2000s, done last month by Pew Research Center, indicates that the culture war � particularly opposition to marriage equality and abortion � is now helping neither Republicans nor Christians.

The math is simple, and dire, for both sides of that now-traditional alliance. Christians who embrace the Republican platform are migrating to the other side of the grass. Replacing them are a wave of millennials who are OK with gay marriage, pro-choice and in favor of marijuana legalization.

Only 10 years ago, President George W. Bush won his re-election campaign largely because his campaign strategists got anti-gay-marriage referenda placed on the ballots in key states, chiefly Ohio, which got Christians out to the polls. They stuck around long enough

Embarking on the next stage in taking its first product to market, Scanadu has partnered with Dr. Eric Topol at the Scripps Translational Science Institute to conduct clinical testing on the Scout device, a medical tricorder that measures a host of metrics like blood pressure and heart rate. Those trials are set to begin in Q1 of 2014.

While Scanadu is equipping the Scout with off-the-shelf sensors, each needs a 501(k) clearance from the FDA, as do any groups of sensors working in conjunction with each other. That’s the whole point of the Scout: it combines existing trackers into one handy device.

“This is a device that comes out of nothing,” Scanadu CEO Walter De Brouwer said. “There was nothing that you could build on. You put all sorts of sensors together in a small package and make it do stuff that it hasn’t done before.”

The goal is to have the commercial device available to consumers by the winter of 2014 or Q1 of 2015. Before that, the Scout will ship to the 8,000 people who preordered through the Indiegogo campaign in March. Scanadu will be doing usability testing on volunteers from that cohort in order to glean how exactly consumers will use the Scout: how many times a day they check it and what metrics they are most interested in tracking, for instance.

The Scout will work with a companion app, which functions as a medical record populated by data taken by the device. As consumers are encouraged to take a more active role in their health — especially with regard to disease prevention — it’s a way to look at various metrics over time.

The app can also provide recommendations on what tests people might want to pay closer attention to. If one person is checking his blood pressure and cholesterol, Scanadu can inform him that people checking those metrics are also watching their heart rate, and perhaps he should look at that, too.

“Infection was one of our old enemies. We now have that under control,” De Brouwer said. “The 21st century enemy is cardiovascular disease. Replacing the thermometer with a device that tests blood pressure, diastolic pressure, your ECG, heartrate, and records and analyzes that

» Can ferries play a useful role in the broader public transportation system?

Most major cities are situated along some body of water — usually a river or two, often a lake or the ocean. There’s a good reason for this: waterways played an important role historically as transportation links for people and freight. They also allowed connections across barriers insurmountable by ground-based transportation; in the early 1900s, for example, ferries were the only mode of transport between Manhattan and Northern New Jersey. But new technologies allowing the construction of underwater road and rail tunnels and the general improvement of ground-based transportation systems have reduced the importance of boats for the average commuter in the urban environment.

In some cities, of course, the ferry never died out as a transportation mode — Venice’s Vaporetto water bus continues to be the primary mode of transit in that pedestrian city; in North America, both Seattle and Vancouver have extensive operations because of their water-bound geography. But for the most part, cities that grew up around their respective rivers have come to ignore them as potential corridors for transit service, citing the slow speed of water-bound travel and the difficulty of getting from the waterfront to business or residential districts.

Yet the transformation of many inner-city waterfronts from industrial zones to parks surrounded by walkable dense neighborhoods has reawakened an interest in using boats for transportation operations. With water views and fresh air, water taxis could be an appealing alternative to more mainstream forms of transit. The news this week that a company called American River Taxi plans to begin transit operations later this year between several of Washington, D.C.’s major waterfront zones is only the latest example of such an initiative.

The Potomac Riverboat Company currently operates a route between Alexandria and National Harbor.

Boats provide a unique opportunity to improve urban transportation because their use requires very little construction spending: unlike trains or buses, they can take advantage of a natural resource to move about, rather than having to rely on a built rail or road route. The only capital expenses required are in the erection of ferry terminals and the purchase of the boats themselves. Replacing some ferry routes with bridges or tunnels for ground-based transportation would cost billions of dollars.

From this perspective, the investment in new boat routes between Georgetown, the Southwest Waterfront, the Navy Yard, Alexandria, and National Harbor could provide significant new connections to areas of the Washington region that don’t have direct transit links today. Each of these neighborhoods has seen significant redevelopment over the past decade, already

Branded as America’s “worst employer in the national hotel industry,” Hyatt is accused of “replacing longtime employees with minimum wage temporary workers and imposing dangerous workloads on those who remain,” adding that “Hyatt housekeepers have high rates of injury.”

What incited the Hyatt workers, after years of silence, to finally confront their employer was when all the housekeepers at three non-unionized Hyatt hotels in Boston, Massachusetts – Hyatt Regency Boston, Hyatt Regency Cambridge, Hyatt Harborside – were arbitrarily fired (with no advance notice) and replaced by temporary workers on August 31, 2009.

Called “The Hyatt 100,” the dismissed workers – some of them had worked for Hyatt for over 20 years – earned widespread support from the public and civil society organizations, led by the unions, and even from various religious groups, politicians and businesses.

The Boston protests may have inspired workers in other Hyatt hotels in the US to later raise their grievances and assert their rights, including those in Chicago, Illinois; Indianapolis, Indiana; San Antonio, Texas; Scottsdale, Arizona; Santa Clara, San Francisco and Long Beach in California; and Seattle, Washington.

The hyatthurts.org website explained that Hyatt’s subcontracting is actually “destroying good jobs and exploiting immigrant workers,” who are either deceived or forced to take jobs with much lower pay and without security of tenure.

It added that Hyatt housekeeping staffs comprise one of the most abused hotel workers in the US. For instance, they had the highest injury rate among housekeepers, according to a study – on 50 hotel facilities from five different hotel firms – published by the American Journal of Industrial Medicine.

Housekeepers or room attendants at some Hyatts have also excessive workloads as they have to clean as many as 30 rooms a day or “as little as 15 minutes” per room. Violations of occupational safety and health standards are also increasing; thus, last year, 11 Hyatt hotels were slapped with 18 citations, and three against one of Hyatt’s housekeeping subcontractors.

In the May 6 nomination race there, Karma Macgregor won by 15 votes over runner-up Jeremy Roberts, even though there were 28 more ballots in the boxes than had registered. Roberts, whose formal appeal of the result was rejected by the party executive Saturday, said the contest “contained highly suspect irregularities.” “There were clear indications of fraud undertaken,” he said in a statement, noting “the events that transpired here send a very dangerous and potentially damaging message about our cause.” Macgregor, a veteran Tory activist and the mother of Brown’s deputy chief of staff, could not be reached for comment.

A Republican-led effort to repeal marriage equality in New Hampshire

decisively failed today. Lawmakers voted against the repeal, against

replacing marriage with civil unions, and against putting marriage

rights up to a voter referendum.

Just to ensure the message

was clear, Republican representative Seth Cohn, who supports marriage

equality, proposed banning marriage between left-handed people. That

didn't pass either.

The final vote was 211-116 to kill a bill

that would have rescinded marriage equality in the state, and the votes

against the repeal included several Republicans, such as Cohn, who

broke with their party.

Gov. John Lynch signed marriage equality

legislation in 2009 after it narrowly passed through the legislature,

and he has promised to veto any effort to repeal the law. It would have

needed to pass through both Republican-led chambers before reaching his

desk.

But the bill, introduced by state representative David

Bates, couldn't muster the votes to pass the House, let alone come

anywhere near the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto.

Bates had also sought a referendum but lost that vote 162-188. Polling on the issue showed that a solid majority of New Hampshire residents opposed rolling back marriage rights for gay residents. And marriage supporters argued that it was their role, not voters', to make a decision on repeal.

It wasn't the first time marriage opponents had tried to put the question on a ballot. House members voted against a similar initiative in 2010, failing to reach the 60% of members' votes to add the initiative to the ballot.

"Our opponents tried to abuse the 2010 Republican legislative sweep in New Hampshire to repeal the popular law," said Marc Solomon, Freedom to Marry’s national campaign director. "What they didn’t count on was the fact that the freedom to marry is becoming a bipartisan value, as resoundingly reflected in today’s vote."<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

The games in the Sims series are largely sandbox games, in that they lack any defined goals (except for some later expansion packs and console versions which introduced this gameplay style). The player creates virtual people called "Sims" and places them in houses and helps direct their moods and satisfy their desires. Players can either place their Sims in pre-constructed homes or build them themselves. Each successive expansion pack and game in the series augmented what the player could do with their Sims.

Development [ edit ]

Will Wright

Game designer Will Wright was inspired to create a "virtual doll house" after losing his home during the Oakland firestorm of 1991 and subsequently rebuilding his life.[2][3] Replacing his home and his other possessions made him think about adapting that life experience into a game. When Wright initially took his ideas to the Maxis board of the directors, they were skeptical and gave little support or financing for the game. The directors at Electronic Arts, which bought Maxis in 1997, were more receptive—SimCity had been a great success for them, and they foresaw the possibility of building a strong Sim franchise.[2]

Wright has stated that The Sims was actually meant as a satire of U.S. consumer culture.[4] Wright took ideas from the 1977 architecture and urban design book A Pattern Language, American psychologist Abraham Maslow's 1943 paper A Theory of Human Motivation and his hierarchy of needs, and Charles Hampden-Turner's Maps of the Mind to develop a model for the game's artificial intelligence.[2]

Steven Patrick Morrissey (; born 22 May 1959), known mononymously as Morrissey, is an English singer, songwriter, and author. He came to prominence as the frontman of the Smiths, a rock band active from 1982 to 1987. Since then, he has pursued a commercially successful solo career. Morrissey's music is characterised by his baritone voice and distinctive lyrical content featuring recurring themes of emotional isolation and sexual longing, self-deprecating and black humour, and anti-establishment stances.

Born in Davyhulme, Lancashire, to a working-class Irish migrant family, Morrissey grew up in Manchester. As a child he developed a love of literature, kitchen sink realism, and pop music. In the late 1970s, he fronted punk rock band the Nosebleeds with little success before beginning a career in music journalism and authoring several books on music and film in the early 1980s. With Johnny Marr he formed the Smiths in 1982, soon attracting national recognition for their eponymous debut album. As the band's frontman, Morrissey attracted attention for his trademark quiff and witty and sardonic lyrics. Deliberately avoiding rock machismo, he cultivated the aesthetic of a sexually ambiguous social outsider who embraced celibacy. The Smiths released three further studio albums—Meat Is Murder, The Queen Is Dead, and Strangeways, Here We Come—and had a string of hit singles. The band were critically acclaimed and attracted a cult following. Personal differences between Morrissey and Marr resulted in the separation of the Smiths in 1987.

In 1988, Morrissey launched his solo career with Viva Hate. This album and its follow-ups—Kill Uncle, Your Arsenal, and Vauxhall and I—all did well on the UK Albums Chart and spawned multiple hit singles. Replacing Marr, he took on Alain Whyte and Boz Boorer as his primary co-writers. During this time his image began to shift into that of a burlier figure, who toyed with patriotic imagery and working-class masculinity. In the mid-to-late 1990s, his albums Southpaw Grammar and Maladjusted also charted but were less well received. Relocating to Los Angeles, he took a musical hiatus from 1998 to 2003 before releasing a successful comeback album

Did President Obama get the economics wrong earlier this month when he abandoned stricter air-quality rules, wagering environmentalist loyalty in a bid to avoid job losses from strict new ozone standards? Paul Krugman thinks so, calling the decision to wave off the EPA a “lousy decision all around.” But is Krugman right?

The short-run job-creating move, Krugman contends, would have been for Obama to promulgate the new ozone regulations, which would have forced firms in hundreds of counties across the country to replace and upgrade capital in order to comply with new, stringent pollution abatement requirements. He asserts that because the U.S. economy is in a liquidity trap, wherein conventional monetary policy is insufficient to induce firms to spend, the regulations could have accomplished what the Fed cannot. In such a “world of topsy-turvy,” as Krugman says, the usual rules of economics are thrown out, and even the “Broken Window Fallacy” ceases to hold.

The 19th century French theorist Frederic Bastiat cautioned against concluding that a shopkeeper’s broken window is a good thing because it induces him to employ a glazier to repair the window. Such a conclusion ignores that which is unseen: that the shopkeeper would have employed the shoemaker to replace his worn out shoes had the window not been broken. Hence, the broken window doesn’t increase employment or grow wealth. In fact, it shrinks wealth, leaving the shopkeeper worse off than if he had been able to replace his worn out shoes for the cost of the new window. The deliberate destruction of windows, then, would assuredly be poor economic policy in normal times because it trades wealth-creating spending for wealth-replacing spending.

But what happens in unusual times, like those of a liquidity trap? Krugman contends that shopkeepers are sitting on stockpiles of cash and not spending. So the shopkeeper’s expenditures to replace broken windows won’t crowd out expenditures on shoes since he wasn’t going to purchase shoes in the short run anyway. So, too, Krugman reasons, forced investments on pollution abatement won’t crowd out other investments since they’re not happening anyway. Thus a policy of capital destruction to spur economic activity, like breaking windows or using regulatory fiat to mothball functional equipment, may never make more sense than during a liquidity trap. But that doesn’t mean it makes sense even then.

In a recent op-ed for The Xenia Gazette, Jamie Raskin, a professor of Constitutional Law at American University and Maryland State Senator who is currently running for U.S. Congress, notes that four of the U.S. Supreme Court’s justices are over the age of 80 and that the next president could have the chance to replace all of them.

"Will the new justices bolster the conservatives, who favor legislative power only when it violates minority rights, or the liberals, who have demonstrated a serious commitment both to voting rights and to the legislative process?"

“Will the new justices bolster the conservatives, who favor legislative power only when it violates minority rights, or the liberals, who have demonstrated a serious commitment both to voting rights and to the legislative process?”

Raskin decries the conservative dissents in the Obergefell v. Hodges same-sex marriage decision, singling out Scalia’s dissent for calling the ruling “a threat to American democracy.”

The phrase would have been more accurate, he said, had it been used in Citizens United, Shelby County v. Holder, or Bush v. Gore.

He argues that Scalia and Roberts “pose as outraged populists regarding marriage equality” who “pretend, ludicrously, that they don’t believe in the court reviewing and invalidating popularly enacted laws.” Yet they have “no problem with nullifying laws that implement affirmative action, produce majority-minority legislative districts, or exclude corporations from spending money in political campaigns.”

“What a joke,” Raskin wrote. “These so-called conservatives strike down almost any law that curtails the power of corporations. They just don’t like the idea of equal protection and due process applying to people.”

Raskin did not respond to Campus Reform’s request for comment.

Previews have shown the game to sometimes display a choppy frame-rate, and include long loading times. When I played the game back in September at EGX, both were noticeable (you can see footage of me playing the preview build below).

Last night, in a reddit AMA, Rime developer Tequila Works spoke about the technical challenges it faced when bringing the game to Switch - and the compromises it decided to make.

"Rime runs at 30fps in 720p throughout most of the game while docked," Tequila Works wrote. "This is a considerable improvement from where the game was at earlier this year when we announced the first delay.

"With Rime being very open in many locations, it's incredibly difficult to get these level segments small enough to not cause a hiccup in performance. We were faced with the choice of adding loading screens throughout the stages, rebuilding the game completely to be more closed in (undermining the product vision in the process), or living with these small hiccups to preserve what the game was intended to be. We chose the latter.

"When looking at the handheld mode, we had to make a choice between lowering the resolution, removing/replacing major parts of the level geometry, or having a bigger hit in performance. We decided to go for the former, because it allows us to maintain the integrity of the gameplay experience. All the important details are still very visible, and we've had no issues playing the game in handheld mode ourselves."

Tequila Works concluded by noting Rime did have similar issues on other platforms, albeit less pronounced.

But the fact Rime runs worst on Switch is particularly frustrating as a copy of Rime on Switch costs more than other platforms. On Amazon UK right now, a PS4 or Xbox One physical copy costs £25. On Switch, a physical copy from Amazon UK costs £32.

It's less than the expected cost of the game - which was initially set as £39.99 back in March, before the Switch port was delayed.

For digital copies, the prices are closer. On the Microsoft Store a digital download costs £23.99, while on both the PlayStation Store and Nintendo Switch eShop, it costs £29.99.

Are you picking up Rime for Switch? Is the added portability of the game worth a lower performance? Let us know.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>The boss of one of Scotland’s leading theatres has quit days after a damning article in The Scotsman raised serious concerns over how it is being run.

Nick Parr has resigned after just two years as chief executive of Dundee Rep, which boasts the country’s only full-time company of actors.

He has left with immediate effect less than two months after the Rep’s new artistic director, Andrew Panton, took charge of his first show. He has quit his role, which also saw him in charge of Scottish Dance Theatre, weeks before Dundee bids to become 2023 European Capital of Culture.

Earlier this year Mr Parr had hailed the financial performance of Dundee Rep and Scottish Dance Theatre, including rises in turnover and operating profit, and a 17 per cent boost at the box office.

However Kirsty Gunn’s opinion column in The Scotsman last Monday told how the company had been left “devastated and depressed” by cuts in its production department. She raised concerns of a growing culture “replacing creativity with bureaucracy, artists and intellectuals with managers”.

Mr Parr arrived at the Rep, which dates back to 1939, in September 2015 after previously working as commercial director at a trust running the Festival Theatre and King’s Theatre in Edinburgh.

It was the first time Dundee Rep had decided to split the post of chief executive and artistic director. However, the then holder of the latter post, Jemima Levick, announced her departure to another theatre company, Stellar Quines, less than six months later.

Mr Panton, who was allowed to combine his Dundee Rep role with an existing job as artistic director of musical theatre at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow, has been appointed interim joint chief excutive of the theatre, along with SDT’s artistic director, Fleur Darkin.

An official statement said: “Nick Parr has left his role as chief executive of Dundee Rep and Scottish Dance Theatre Ltd to pursue other opportunities. Andrew Panton and Fleur Darkin have been appointed interim joint chief executives.”

Ed Troughton, chair of the board, said: “We would like to thank Nick for his hard work and we wish him all the best. Andrew and Fleur will work with a strong and experienced senior management team to lead the organisation, and will report directly to the board.

“The other trustees and I are currently reviewing the structure and governance of the organisation to ensure we are in the strongest possible position for the future.”

The new state flag of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar is hoisted at the mast at the City Hall of Yangon, former capital and commercial city of Myanmar, October 21, 2010. REUTERS/Aung Hla Tun

The changes were outlined in a new constitution published in 2008 but the government had not announced a date for their introduction.

The country’s new name is the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, instead of the Union of Myanmar.

The military, which has ruled since a 1962 coup, changed the country’s name in English from Burma to Myanmar in 1989, a year after widespread protests against military rule were crushed, and a year before the last election.

That election was won by the party of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi but the military ignored the result. Suu Kyi has spent 15 of the past 21 years in detention.

The new flag has a horizontal band of light green at the top, dark green in the center and red at the bottom, with a white star in the middle. There has been no official explanation as to what the colors or the star represent.

Nor has there been any explanation as to why the changes, which include a new state seal, were being made.

Officials in various government departments told Reuters they were ordered to change the flags.

“We were caught by surprise when we got the order at short notice. There was also an order that the old flags must be burned,” said one official who declined to be identified.

The order stipulated that the old flag had to be lowered by someone born on a Tuesday and the new flag had to be raised by someone born on a Wednesday, he said.

“It must have been instructed by astrologers,” he said.

Myanmar’s secretive military rulers, who will retain ultimate power no matter who wins the November 7 parliamentary election, are widely believed to consult astrologers.

Several dozen passers-by watched the formal ceremony to change the flags at Yangon City Hall.

One, who declined to be identified, said the change was akin to putting old wine in new bottles: “The label has changed but what is really needed is a change of the wine.”<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

But the project’s cost is rising quickly, and NASA managers are struggling to keep its budget in check.

The Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) has grown in scope and complexity since it was proposed nearly a decade ago, and its price has swollen from US$1.6 billion in 2010 to the current estimate of $3.2 billion ($2.4 billion in 2010 dollars). That has raised concern at NASA, which in April commissioned a review by independent aero-space experts. Their report is due in the next few months.

Above all, the agency wants to keep WFIRST from following the path of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), a successor to the Hubble telescope that is scheduled to launch in 2018. That project’s cost spiralled from $1 billion in the early 2000s to $8.8 billion—and nearly exhausted NASA’s astrophysics budget.

The WFIRST review is meant to stave off that kind of meltdown. “This is a good time to take a look at the scale and scope of the mission,” says Jon Morse, a former head of NASA’s astrophysics division who is now chief executive of the BoldlyGo Institute, a non-profit space-exploration organization in New York City. “Nobody wants this thing to double in cost.”

Bonus features

WFIRST was the top-ranked big space mission in the 2010 decadal survey in astronomy and astrophysics, a list created by researchers to prioritize projects for the next ten years. Then the National Reconnaissance Office gave NASA a 2.4-metre mirror—replacing WFIRST’s planned 1.5-metre mirror—and the space agency started dreaming big. The larger mirror allowed NASA to add a corona-graph, an instrument that studies exoplanets by blocking light from the stars they orbit.

And NASA made other design changes to go along with the big mirror. It also began to consider adding a ‘starshade’, a free-floating umbrella-like spacecraft that would fly alongside WFIRST and block enough light for the telescope to spy Earth-sized planets.

WFIRST’s heart is a gigantic camera with 18 detectors, each capable of capturing a 16-mega-pixel shot—giving it a field of view 200 times Hubble

<|begin_of_text|>Mithost said: My intention from posting my original reply was not to immediately unban the controllers, but to get more information from those in charge on what the current barriers are. If you don't mind me asking, what are some examples of the logistical issues you mention?

Outside of Smash, I am an active member of the wider fighting game community. At both local tournaments and large scale events, I have seen people play with everything from a PS1 gamepad with a converter to a pizza box with 20+ buttons on it without any issues. Controller configurations that prove to be problematic from a logistical or competitive point of view are banned when they prove to be problematic at an event (most wireless controllers, turbo buttons, and certain buggy platform converters). If a community so similar to our own in terms of logistics can run well with very lax controller rules, what is different about Smash that changes the logistics enough to warrant banning the controllers? Click to expand...

The main difference between Melee and other FGs, as I'm sure you know, is the use of analog controls. Replacing left, right, up, and down with digital buttons is not a huge change for the average FG. For Melee, being able to hit precise angles is obviously a very powerful technique. Whether it's for perfect up-B angles, airdodges, wavedashes/wavelands, or DI, hitting specific angles is a skill that has been an inherent part of the game since its inception. If you have a controller that can do all of this for free, you're removing skill from the game and creating an unearned skill gap between the players who use a custom controller vs. the standard. Hax himself has admitted that his perfect wavedash angles were obnoxiously good, so he has attempted to mitigate this advantage by preventing perfect angles on the B0XX. There are plenty of other issues, such as multiple SDI inputs. Due to the nature of a button vs. a stick, you can easily double/triple tap fightstick buttons to get multiple SDIs. I'm not very experienced on a fightstick, but it still only took me a few minutes of testing to get 3 inputs in a 5 frame window. This kind of capability would result in people triple SDIing shines, and would greatly ruin the integrity of the game.All of these advantages that make custom controllers able to perform things that are normally difficult or impossible would have to be limited before these controllers could be allowed. That means TOs have to decide how good

Organizers of the former Montreal Anarchist Bookfair are celebrating their new identity after they renamed themselves The Bourgeois Feminist Bookfair. “We realized that we’re not an anarchist collective after all,” says activist and bourgeois neo-liberal feminist Lucy Descharnes. “We don’t care about anarchism, we don’t care about the working class, and we don’t care about economic issues. Our main interest is in protecting the privileges of wealthy university graduates, so we decided to change the name of our organization to better reflect our actual values. We’re bourgeois, we're educated, we're affluent, and we're proud of it."Anarchists across Montreal say that they’re not surprised by the name change. “I can’t remember the last time the anarchist bookfair actually catered to genuine anarchists,” says working class activist Jesse Hogan. “It’s been a giant bourgeois shit show for the last decade. Last year took the cake, though, after they gave white and affluent academic feminists the power to ban men from attending the event. Seriously, if a wealthy educated feminist didn’t like you, you couldn’t attend. All she had to say was that you made her feel uncomfortable. The organizers justified their actions because they believe that working class men have more power and privilege than bourgeois feminists. I’m not comfortable with bourgeois feminists being anywhere near me, but the bookfair doesn’t care about creating a safe space for the working class. Safe spaces only exist to protect the bourgeoisie from the rabble."Lucy agrees. “At the end of the day, a wealthy white woman with a Ph.D from Concordia is far more oppressed than a working class man who was born into poverty,” says Lucy. “At the Bourgeois Feminist Bookfair, we believe in intersectional feminism, which is the religious conviction that oppressions intersect in a way that minimizes and erases class privilege. For example, if you’re a poor homeless man, your penis gives you way more privilege than Martha Stewart or Michelle Obama. A homeless man’s male privilege intersects with his poverty, erasing it’s very existence from the face of the earth. Bourgeois feminists recognize that class is irrelevant — it’s the least important factor in oppression. We also believe in the one drop rule: if you have a single drop of non-economic privilege, that privilege erases the economic factors in your life. You’re white? Your class doesn’t matter. You're a man? Your class doesn’t matter. You’re straight?

Hard drive storage continues to increase at a steady rate, but just how long can we keep squeezing more data on to those platters? TDK has managed to ensure that the density keeps rising for a few more generations with its HAMR head innovation, but that may have already been rendered redundant through another discovery by a Dr Joel Yang at the Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE).

Existing hard drives max out at 3TB at the moment. TDK’s HAMR promises to take that to 6TB, but Dr Yang has found a way to increase the data density of a drive to 3.3 Terabit/inch2, effectively meaning 18TB hard drives are possible.

What may surprise you is the key to this massive increase in data storage density. Dr Yang used table salt, or more specifically, sodium chloride.

Data stored on a hard drive is done so using nanoscopic magnetic grains. Typically, several of these grains (a cluster), each measuring around 7nm, are used to store one bit of information. Therefore, if you can pack them more densely together, you get more storage in the same space.

By adding sodium chloride to the mix, it has been possible to get a single 10nm grain storing one bit. Replacing several 7nm grains with one 10nm saves a lot of space and therefore ups the storage density considerably.

The good news is the use of sodium chloride can be added to existing lithography processes, suggesting it won’t take too long to get this up and running for commercial drives. So far a 1.9 Terabit/inch2 storage solution has been shown to work, but that will increase to 3.3 Terabit/inch2, and then further research and development is aiming to achieve 10 Terabit/inch2 in the future.

For us as consumers, it means the hard drive still has quite a few years of storage bumps still to come, and a greater challenge for SSDs trying to catch up with the amount of storage on offer. This also bodes well for data centers who need to cater for a never-ending storage need as more cloud services go online.

"We weren't really making it too difficult on Americans," the Jeopardy! host joked.

You may recall not long ago Trump reversed Obama’s decision which forced states to allow trannies into certain bathrooms. Our current President didn’t outlaw those transgender bathroom privileges, but simply restored the states’ power to discern for themselves. Therein lies the outrage.

Apple and other companies have decided to take a stand… By getting involved in a lawsuit filed by a trans student suing his school for boys’ bathroom privileges.

Something to note here? People were uncomfortable sharing the restroom with Gavin Grimm, the girl-boy, so the school provided a unisex restroom to him in an attempt to make everyone happy. The boys wouldn’t have to bare themselves before a lady-man, and the trans student wouldn’t have to share a restroom with girls. But it wasn’t enough for the amorphous slug. Of course.

Now he’s demanding access to the boys’ rooms via lawsuit. Entitled little toad. This is the case that Apple and friends are jumping in to support…

A number of leading tech firms plan to file a brief in favor of transgender rights in a case due to be heard next month in the Supreme Court. Apple has been among those leading the charge on the effort, along with… Affirm, Box, Ebay, GitHub, IBM, Microsoft, PayPal, Salesforce, Slack, Tumblr, Yelp. Apple has already spoken out on the Trump Administration’s move to pull back on Obama-era guidance that interpreted existing law to require schools to let students use the restroom that matches their gender identity. The Supreme Court case, involving Virginia high school student Gavin Grimm, asks the court to weigh in on the same question.

These companies really, really care about rights. Just not the rights of the states. Or those who want to potty in peace. It seems as though Apple misses not a single opportunity to get hyper-political (see Apple Goes Full PC, Replaces ‘Offensive’ Gun Emoji With Squirt Gun… and Far-Left Apple CEO to Wage War on Fake News. Misses HUGE Irony…). We’re finding that tech companies are becoming more and more politically involved. Why stick with creating better tech products when you can wade into potty politics? Maybe there’s an app for that.

Look, this is America, where businesses can say and do what they please. The problem here? These companies are alienating a large portion of their

The late political scientist Samuel Huntington marveled at its place in our national life: We pledge allegiance to it. The national anthem celebrates it. An incredibly elaborate code stipulates how it’s displayed, handled and maintained. It even has its own holiday.

“Since the Civil War,” Huntington wrote, “Americans have been a flag-oriented people. The Stars and Stripes has the status of a religious icon and is a more central symbol of national identity for Americans than their flags are for peoples of other nations.”

The NFL players who kneel during the national anthem — a phenomenon that increased exponentially after President Trump colorfully demanded they stand — are disrespecting the most potent and enduring national symbol of the most patriotic nation on Earth.

Not only are they wrong to do so, they aren’t delivering the devastating rebuke to Trump they may imagine.

The power of national — or imperial — symbols isn’t new. The Romans couldn’t abide the collective disgrace of losing their standards to the enemy in battle, and would undertake decades-long campaigns to win them back.

The American flag is layered with history and meaning. As Tim Marshall recounts in his book, “A Flag Worth Dying For,” its roots probably reach back prior to the country’s independence. It may owe its red and white stripes to the flag of the Sons of Liberty, the revolutionary agitators who carried out the Boston Tea Party.

The “rebellious stripes” of that flag, lacking a field of stars, don’t look like much. In 1777, the Continental Congress added the stars.

The flag took time to catch on. The Civil War, which tested the integrity of the flag, represented a watershed. It came to be known as Old Glory at this time, courtesy of a cussed merchant seaman named William Driver, who demonstrated a characteristic American attitude to the Stars and Stripes.

Driver had retired to Nashville, Tenn., with his flag still in his possession. When local Confederates demanded he hand it over, he replied that they were welcome to take it — over his dead body. Secreted in a bed quilt, the flag was eventually handed over to Union forces, and the legend of Old Glory spread.

After the war, Union veterans advocated for the display of the flag and for its veneration. The National Flag Conference of 1923 — yes, there was a national flag conference — set out the code subsequently adopted by Congress.

Per the code, “the flag represents a living country and is

Leader Jeremy Corbyn immediately responded warmly to the announcement

“This vote is a victory for democracy and for the people of this country,” he said.

“And rest assured we will use it to continue our long-standing policy of doing f**k all about Brexit.”

Labour have been committed to doing f**k all about Britain leaving the EU since the referendum was announced by David Cameron, whoever he is, some eighteen months ago.

Immediately after the referendum announcement, Jeremy Corbyn swung into action by doing f**k all.

When campaigning started in earnest Labour remained constant in doing f**k all.

Not wishing to let the momentum drop, at the height of the campaign Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell did f**k all.

Finally, when the referendum result was announced, Jeremy Corbyn did his best to rally shellshocked remainers by doing f**k all.

Every day since, Labour has remained proudly committed to doing f**k all about Brexit and, with this new announcement, look set to continue doing f**k all until the country is completely isolated and vilified, and is ultimately reduced to being little more than a nice place for Donald Trump to park his helicopter.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Cliff Burton, who was one of the founding members of Metallica, played bass guitar on the metal band’s first three albums until he was killed in a tour bus accident in 1986.

The royalties from these albums have been going to Cliff’s 92-year-old father Ray—and the senior has only now revealed what he’s been spending that money on.

Ray has been donating all of the Metallica royalties towards musical scholarships for Castro Valley High School students in the San Francisco Bay area of California.

The school has sentimental value to Ray since it was the school which Cliff attended when he was younger.

“The kids who won it, they invariably write and thank me,” Ray told the Alphabettica podcast host last month. “And I think Cliff probably would have done that with his money, because he was not against education by any means. He liked it very much.”

We’ve found that Kotlin not only makes our code much better, but massively increases programmer happiness. All of this ensures we’re making the best app we can for the tens of thousands of Android users we support.

Given our new experiences with the language, I thought it’d be worth sharing some specifics that make the language so wonderful to work with.

Unlike most articles that introduce you to a language, I’m going to avoid using too much programming lingo. Instead, I’ll try using plain English in the hopes that it’s more accessible to beginners. 🤗

Some notes about the code examples:

I am by no stretch an expert in Kotlin. Read, consider, and discuss!

They look better on a desktop browser. You can get by on the mobile app in landscape mode, but I’d recommend breaking out your laptop to read them.

You can get by on the mobile app in landscape mode, but I’d recommend breaking out your laptop to read them. They’re brief and simple on purpose. Long-winded examples tend to cause confusion. Take these simple examples and extrapolate them into your own potential uses, and you’ll see a lot more power.

Let’s get started with seven of my current favorites!

1. Replacing simple if/else if/else blocks with when

One of my absolute favorites.

// Java

if (firstName.equals("Dan")) {

person.setTeam(programmers);

} else if (lastName.equals("Dihiansan")) {

person.setTeam(designers);

} else {

person.setTeam(others);

}

// Kotlin

when {

firstName == "Dan" -> person.team = programmers

lastName == "Dihiansan" -> person.team = designers

else -> person.team = others

}

when blocks are effectively the same as a simple if block, but look how much more readable that is!

There’s a similar convention when only one argument is being checked. Typically this would be a long, ugly switch/case statement in Java.

// Java

switch (firstName) {

case "Dan": person.setTeam(programmers)

break;

case "Jay": person.setTeam(programmers)

break;

case "Jamie": person.setTeam(designers)

break;

default:

person.setTeam(others)

}

// Kotlin

when (firstName) {

"Dan", "Jay" -> person.team = programmers

"Jamie

In this exclusive extract from A Book For Her, the standup comedian tells you everything you need to know about the movement that is the sole cause of the recession, global warming, terrorism, pandemics, cancelled flights, volcanos, delayed trains and pedantic health and safety regulations

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Bridget Christie: ‘I even hate Ban Ki-moon.’ Photograph: David Levene/Guardian

I am a feminist. All this means is that I am extremely hairy and hate all men, both as individuals and collectively, with no exceptions. Nope. Not even Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen/Paul Hollywood/Ronnie Corbett/Trevor McDonald/David Attenborough or John Nettles circa Bergerac are good enough for me.

I even hate Ban Ki-moon. It’s one thing to try to eradicate female genital mutilation and forced marriage, but Mrs Ban Ki-moon told me she can’t remember the last time her husband put the Hoover round. Or sprayed his own soiled pants with pre-wash Vanish. Feminism begins at home, Mr Ban, not at the UN. Huh! Ban Ki-hypocrite, more like.

Feminists don’t like humour, except slapstick. Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, Laurel and Hardy and Bottom are all very popular at feminist comedy nights. Anything that involves men being physically harmed always goes down very well with feminists. They also enjoy watching Tom and Jerry, Road Runner cartoons and war documentaries.

Feminists never have sex and hate men opening doors for them, even into other dimensions.

Christmas is banned in the “feminist community”, along with birthdays, wallpaper, nuance, giving people the benefit of the doubt and all music. Feminists only ever listen to one song, on a loop: kd lang’s Constant Craving.

All feminists are lesbians. There is not a single heterosexual woman in the world who believes that women should have equal rights. Not one. If a feminist says she is heterosexual or bisexual or asexual, she is lying. They are all lesbians.

Feminism is the sole cause of the recession, global warming, terrorism, pandemics, cancelled flights, volcanos, delayed trains and overly pedantic health and safety regulations. You can’t have hot drinks at work now because of feminism, or climb up small stepladders in libraries. You can’t eat a lobster without safety goggles now because of feminists.

Watch out, Washington: CISPA replaces SOPA as Internet�s Enemy No. 1

By Andrew Couts

Digital Trends

....Unveiled to the House by Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI) and Rep. C.A. �Dutch� Ruppersberger (D-MD) late last year, CISPA is described as a �cybersecurity� bill. It proposes to amend the National Security Act of 1947 to allow for greater sharing of �cyber threat intelligence� between the U.S. government and the private sector, or between private companies. The bill defines �cyber threat intelligence� as any information pertaining to vulnerabilities of, or threats to, networks or systems owned and operated by the U.S. government, or U.S. companies; or efforts to �degrade, disrupt, or destroy� such systems or networks; or the theft or �misappropriation� of any private or government information, including intellectual property.

....

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) adds that CISPA�s definition of �cybersecurity� is so broad that �it leaves the door open to censor any speech that a company believes would �degrade the network.�� Moreover, the inclusion of �intellectual property� means that companies and the government would have �new powers to monitor and censor communications for copyright infringement.�

Furthermore, critics warn that CISPA gives private companies the ability to collect and share information about their customers or users with immunity � meaning we cannot sue them for doing so, and they cannot be charged with any crimes. According to the EFF, CISPA �effectively creates a �cybersecurity� exemption to all existing laws.�

�There are almost no restrictions on what can be collected and how it can be used, provided a company can claim it was motivated by �cybersecurity purposes,�� the EFF continues. �That means a company like Google, Facebook, Twitter, or AT&T could intercept your emails and text

<|begin_of_text|>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ‘replaced’ Mahatma Gandhi in the 2017 wall calendar and table diary published by the Khadi Village Industries Commission (KVIC), official sources said on Thursday, as opposition leaders reacted sharply to the move.

The cover photo of the calendar and diary shows Modi weaving khadi on a large ‘charkha’, in the same classic pose as Gandhiji. In response, the employees of KVIC at its Vile Parle headquarters plan to stage “a silent, soul-cleansing” protest wearing black bands on their mouths, during lunch hour on Thursday.

Political leaders took a jibe at the Prime Minister for replacing the iconic image of Gandhi, including Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and former AAP member Yogendra Yadav, tweeting about it.

“Becoming Gandhi requires years of austerities. One cannot become Gandhi by acting to spin the Charkha, this would only ridicule them,” Kejriwal said in a tweet.

Gandhiji would've welcomed it, also opposed his photo on notes.

We should welcome it too. Less hypocrisy.https://t.co/q1fVI2RYmA — Yogendra Yadav (@_YogendraYadav) January 12, 2017

While Gandhi’s historic picture weaving khadi on a simple charkha, wearing his trademark loin cloth, is legendary and imprinted in the minds of the masses since generations, Modi comes across in his signature attire of kurta-pyjama-waistcoat, weaving khadi on a slightly modern charkha.

KVIC chairman Vinai Kumar Saxena said this was “not unusual” and there have been deviations in the past.

“The entire khadi industry (udyog) is based on Gandhiji’s philosophy, ideas and ideals, he is the soul of KVIC, so there is no question of ignoring him,” Saxena told IANS.

Thousands of Catalans have rallied in Barcelona, Spain, demanding the right to hold a referendum on independence.

Participants, waving Catalan flags and wearing the flag's red and yellow colours, stood in a V-shape formation, indicating their desire for a vote.

Protesters were energised by Scotland's forthcoming independence referendum - and many also waved the Scottish flag.

The regional government has called a referendum for 9 November. The Spanish government says the vote is illegal.

"We want to decide our future. We don't understand why that is constantly denied," Victor Panyella, a professor taking part in the rally, told Reuters.

Ana Melendez, another participant, told the BBC she was "jealous" of Scotland, which has a referendum on independence from the rest of the United Kingdom on 18 September.

Catalonia is one of Spain's richest and most highly industrialised regions, and also one of the most independent-minded.

Image copyright AFP Image caption The Scottish flag could also be glimpsed among the Catalonia flags in the crowd

Until recently, few Catalans had wanted full independence, but Spain's painful economic crisis has seen a surge in support for separation.

The national government is opposed to any move towards independence. According to the Spanish constitution, the central government's blessing is required to make a referendum legal.

At the scene: Tom Burridge, BBC News, Barcelona

On Catalonia's national day, or La Diada, as it's called here, a huge crowd formed the thin red and yellow stripes of the Catalan flag, creating a giant 'V' for vote.

Look closer and you could see an endless number of pro-independence Catalan flags, which have a blue triangle and a silver star.

There were also a handful of Scottish flags fluttering in the wind.

Each year, the atmosphere at the La Diada celebrations is electric and it's easy to imagine the event being infectious for some.

The Catalan national anthem rings out, as do the deafening chants of "independence". People's dogs wear flags and people's faces are painted, party-style, in the Catalan colours.

The true numbers present in Barcelona today will be disputed, but a large chunk of the Catalan population turned out.

However another large number did not. The opinion polls are complex depending on the question, but if it's a simple "

<|begin_of_text|>Silver Physical Supplies and Price Action

The basic tenets of economics tell us that supply, demand, and price as all intertwined, especially in free markets. While the silver market may be not as free as we would like, compared to most, it is relatively free, and it should be very much subject to basic economic laws.

Last week, I called a number of silver buyers, sellers and coin shops to get an idea of how the market was responding to the massive run up in silver prices. Needless to say, the results weren't exactly as I had expected. I thought that during the run up, shops would report that some of their regular investors had been taking profits. This wasn't the case.

The Survey

In what cannot at all be seen as an entirely representative sample, a total of 15 coin shops were phoned and surveyed about their total sales. All but three had seen an increase in sales of junk jewelry metals, as people were cashing out for a variety of reasons, most of which are probably preparing for the holidays. One said he had seen a decrease in junk sales, but admitted he had no hard numbers on which to base his claim.

The remaining two declined to comment. One suggested that it was a theft risk to release such data. We'll mark that particular shop as busier than normal.

As for sales of silver, all of the shops who said they were purchasing more junk silver than normal noted that they had, in fact, sold more silver bullion, even as prices rose higher. A few, more than willing to divulge such information, even noted that the regulars were buying more weight, while one-time customers were coming in to raise cash.

Therefore, from our small study, it can be reasonably concluded that even as prices tear towards the upside, there is little interest among the current physical silver investing community to let go of their silver. Instead, as prices head higher, we, as the good little investors we are, continue to buy more, not less, of the beautiful metals.

The Irony of Investment Markets

This is perhaps the irony of the silver markets, or any non-replacement investment market for that matter. As the market heads higher, the supply is not increasing at the retail recycling level or at the production level. Silver miners are not wholly silver miners, and they have to find copper before they can find silver. Therefore, while miners would love to start working overtime to dig silver, supplies ready to be quickly unearthed have yet to be discovered.

Becky: (noun) ; a white woman who uses her privilege as a weapon, a ladder or an excuse. Ex : “A random Becky hit me up on Twitter to explain why not all white women are racist.”

What started as a controversial term for fellatio has blossomed into an all-encompassing term for a specific class of white women. Not all white women are Beckies, but all Beckies are white women. However, just as people note that “black people are not a monolith,” it is unfair to paint the entire genus of Beckies with the same broad brush.

To combat this stereotype, we gathered some of the world’s leading board-certified Beckyologists and asked them to classify the disparate classes of Beckies so that we may have a better understanding when we discuss this subject. And after much discussion, our experts came up with five subgroups into which all Beckies can be categorized.

Rebecca

This is the standard, off-the shelf Becky with no adornments, around whom the entire world revolves. When “alt-righters” recite the 14 words, “Because the beauty of the white Aryan woman must not perish from the earth,” this is about whom they are talking. This is for whom they made Forever 21. This is for whom they make Pantene hair conditioner. This is for whom they made America.

It is easy to recognize a Rebecca. She can’t understand how anyone could be cruel to a puppy, but turns the channel when they talk about Trayvon Martin. She is gluten-free and eats only free-range chicken, but will call the cops if she spots a “suspicious-looking” hoodie-wearing teenager in her neighborhood. In the South, she often wears dresses and cowboy boots. She sometimes wears Umbros and flip-flops. She always wears privilege.

Unaware of her Becky-ness, she asks questions born out of privilege, like, “Can I touch your hair?” or “Is this racist?” She loves everybody. She clutches her purse when you get close to her. She writes that Sharonda is “too loud and aggressive” in her employee evaluation. She begins every sentence with “Well, actually... ” She hates the term “Becky.”

<|begin_of_text|>(a) The general principles and factors that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considered in arriving at the reference amounts customarily consumed per eating occasion (reference amounts) which are set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, are that: (1) FDA calculated the reference amounts for persons 4 years of age or older to reflect the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by persons in this population group. These reference amounts are based on data set forth in appropriate national food consumption surveys. (2) FDA calculated the reference amounts for an infant or child under 4 years of age to reflect the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by infants up to 12 months of age or by children 1 through 3 years of age, respectively. These reference amounts are based on data set forth in appropriate national food consumption surveys. Such reference amounts are to be used only when the food is specially formulated or processed for use by an infant or by a child under 4 years of age. (3) An appropriate national food consumption survey includes a large sample size representative of the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the relevant population group and must be based on consumption data under actual conditions of use. (4) To determine the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion, FDA considered the mean, median, and mode of the consumed amount per eating occasion. (5) When survey data were insufficient, FDA took various other sources of information on serving sizes of food into consideration. These other sources of information included: (i) Serving sizes used in dietary guidance recommendations or recommended by other authoritative systems or organizations; (ii) Serving sizes recommended in comments; (iii) Serving sizes used by manufacturers and grocers; and (iv) Serving sizes used by other countries. (6) Because they reflect the amount customarily consumed, the reference amount and, in turn, the serving size declared on the product label are based on only the edible portion of food, and not bone, seed, shell, or other inedible components. (7) The reference amount is based on the major intended use of the food (e.g., milk as a beverage and not as an addition to cereal). (8) The reference amounts for products that are consumed as an ingredient of other foods, but that may also be consumed in the form in which they are purchased (e.g., butter), are based on use in the form purchased.

Oct. 23, 2017, 12:39 PM GMT / Updated Oct. 23, 2017, 12:39 PM GMT By Chuck Todd, Mark Murray and Carrie Dann

First Read is your briefing from Meet the Press and the NBC Political Unit on the day's most important political stories and why they matter.

GOP wrestles with tax politics — but what about the policy?

WASHINGTON — On a conference call Sunday afternoon with House Republicans, NBC’s Kasie Hunt reports, President Trump issued this warning: The GOP needs to pass his tax plan or it will lose in the 2018 midterms.

Failure, he said, would be “really bad” for the party in next year’s elections, while success would be “like skating on ice.”

But that focus on the tax plan’s electoral politics — when the midterm cake is already being baked — ignores the more important policy questions right now.

Will the GOP tax plan really RAISE taxes on middle-class and upper-middle-class Americans? Given that the initial plan eliminates personal exemptions (replaced by a larger standard deduction), the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center said one-quarter of American taxpayers would pay higher taxes by 2027, including 30 percent with incomes between $50,000 and $150,000 and 60 percent of those making between $150,000 and $300,000.

How much will the plan add to the deficit? The Treasury Department announced Friday that the federal budget deficit increased to $666 billion in the just-completed fiscal year – up from $585 billion last year. And that’s significant, because the Tax Policy Center says the GOP tax plan would reduce revenues by $2.4 trillion over the first 10 years (or $240 billion per year).

How much will the wealthy benefit vs. everyone else? Since the GOP proposal, among other things, eliminates the estate tax and lowers taxes for “pass-through” businesses, the same Tax Policy Center says that more than half of the benefits in the first year go to the Top 1 percent of taxpayers, while 30 percent of the benefits will go to the Top 0.1 percent.

Are Republicans really going to tax 401k accounts? That has been one of the trial balloons that Republicans have released. “The proposals under discussion would potentially cap the annual amount workers can set aside to as low as $2,400 for 401(k) accounts,

The study, conducted by scientists at The National Weight Control Registry, determined conclusively that shedding excess weight has never occurred, changing your appearance is impossible, and that it actually feels “pretty nice” to just give up and realize that you’re powerless to alter your body mass index in any way, shape, or form.

“Our findings indicate that if you’re trying to lose weight, you will fail—and that’s because you can’t, no one has, and you need to stop trying because it will never happen,” said Dr. Rena Wing, lead author of the report. “You could work out every day and eat nothing, and you still wouldn’t lose an ounce. And the sooner you throw up your hands and make peace with that fact, the better off you’ll be.”

“Our data demonstrates that you’re doomed to look the way you look,” Wing added. “You are stuck in your body and it’s never going to look any better than it does right now. In fact, it will only get worse.”

According to the study, running on a treadmill every morning at 6 a.m. will not help anyone lose weight, and neither will cutting carbohydrates from one’s diet, eating smaller portions throughout the day, doing yoga, or hiring a personal trainer. In addition, the study went on to state that everyone who tried the previous methods have only ended up feeling disappointed and in some cases heartbroken, especially after individuals step onto a scale and realize that, after two weeks of healthy eating and nonstop exercise, they’ve actually gained two or more pounds.

The report added that skinny people stay skinny, overweight people remain overweight, that’s how it has always been, that’s how it will always be, and every study, book, or news article you’ve ever read that has told you otherwise has been totally and completely wrong.

“Going to the gym is a waste of time if you are doing it to lose weight,” said University of California physiologist Dr. Andrew Novak, adding that time working out would be better spent reading, spending time with your family, sleeping, watching television, or eating. “Now, if you are exercising to prevent heart disease or cancer, well, new evidence has come to light that

<|begin_of_text|>Content delivery network and Web security company Cloudflare has made a name for itself by fending off denial-of-service attacks against its customers large and small. Today, it's launching a new service aimed at winning over the most paranoid of corporate customers. The service is a first step toward doing for network security what Amazon Web Services and other public cloud services have done for application services—replacing on-premises hardware with virtualized services spread across the Internet.

Called Keyless SSL, the new service allows organizations to use Cloudflare’s network of 28 data centers around the world to defend against distributed denial of service attacks on their websites without having to turn over private encryption keys. Keyless SSL breaks the encryption “handshake” at the beginning of a Transport Layer Security (TLS) Web session, passing part of the data back to the organization’s data center for encryption. It then negotiates the session with the returned data and acts as a gateway for authenticated sessions—while still being able to screen out malicious traffic such as denial of service attacks.

In an interview with Ars, Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince said that the technology behind Keyless SSL could help security-minded organizations embrace other cloud services while keeping a tighter rein on them. “If you decide you’re going to use cloud services today, how you set policy across all of these is impossible," he said. "Now that we can do this, fast forward a year, and we can do things like data loss prevention, intrusion detection… all these things are just bytes in the stream, and we’re already looking at them.”

All of that puts Cloudflare on a path to, as Prince put it, do to Cisco and other network hardware suppliers what AWS and other cloud services have done to Hewlett-Packard and Dell-type server vendors. The technology could also help extend Internet services to areas of the world that lack the sort of trustworthy data centers that Cloudflare and other cloud providers operate from, as it keeps their most precious secrets locked away back at the core of their networks.

Changing the locks

The development of Keyless SSL began about two years ago, on the heels of a series of massive denial of service attacks against major financial institutions alleged to have been launched from Iran. “We got a series of fairly frantic calls from those banks saying they needed help with this problem,” Prince said. “We met with JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs… pretty much everyone in that community. They described to us a challenge that put them between a rock and a hard place. They had spent billions on hardware

<|begin_of_text|>This article was originally published April 20, 2016, at 1:14 p.m. EST. It has been updated to include comments from Sen. John McCain.

WASHINGTON — Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall, in congressional testimony Wednesday, defended the controversial path to end the US reliance on Russian rocket engines for military space launch—and Senate appropriators signaled their continued support.

That path, for now, involves using more of the engines while the industrial base ramps up to offer competing engines. DoD could replace the RD-180 engines by 2021 at the soonest, but the politicization of the issue is slowing down needed Congressional action, Kendall, the undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics, said at a Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee hearing Wednesday.

"It's a complicated issue, but the [Defense] Department's goals have never changed, to develop two engines, so if one of them has a failure, and we have a big gap in capability, we still have access to space," Kendall said. "We need competition to keep the expense down."

Ultimately, DoD will seek public-private partnerships for reasonably priced launch services, versus buying a lone replacement engine and subsidizing a single company, Kendall said. Replacing the Atlas V with a combination of ULA's Delta IV heavy launch system would cost, Kendall said, as much as $50 million per launch.

"It would be over $1 billion out of our defense budget to get us off RD-180s, and I don't think that's a good tradeoff," Kendall said.

The US Air Force contracts for launch services with United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which uses the RD-180 rocket engine to power its Atlas V launch vehicles.

Two U.S. astronauts, including the oldest woman ever to participate in an Extravehicular Activity (EVA), triumphantly concluded a six-hour and 32-minute spacewalk outside the International Space Station (ISS) earlier today. Expedition 50 Commander Shane Kimbrough and Flight Engineer Peggy Whitson breezed through the task of installing three new adapter plates and hooked up electrical connectors for a trio of new lithium-ion (Li-Ion) batteries on the starboard-side S-4 segment of the station’s Integrated Truss Structure (ITS). Their work heralds the start of a two-year campaign of EVAs and robotics, which will see 48 aging nickel-hydrogen batteries on the port and starboard trusses replaced with 24 smaller, but higher-performing, lithium-ion ones. Working around an hour ahead of the timeline, Kimbrough and Whitson were also able to complete several “get-ahead” tasks, including a photographic survey of the station’s Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-2).

Today’s spacewalk was designated “U.S. EVA-38” and represented the 38th spacewalk to be conducted out of the Quest airlock, with astronauts clad in U.S.-built Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMUs) and conducted in the absence of the space shuttle. Since U.S. EVA-1, way back in February 2002, these excursions have outfitted new hardware, removed and replaced faulty equipment, reconfigured coolant loops, tackled ammonia leaks, and laid cables in readiness for Commercial Crew operations and the arrival or relocation of pressurized modules. Last summer, Expedition 48 spacewalkers Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins performed EVAs 36 and 37 to install an International Docking Adapter (IDA-2) onto the Harmony node and retract the Trailing Thermal Control Radiator (TTCR) on the station’s port-side P-6 truss.

These U.S. Orbital Segment (USOS)-based EVAs have been performed not only by NASA astronauts, but have also involved German, Russian, Japanese, Italian, and British nationals. They have seen a number of records secured, including Sunita Williams becoming the most experienced female spacewalker and holder of the greatest number of EVAs—seven—ever conducted by a woman. Yet during today’s EVA-38, one of Williams’ achievements was

<|begin_of_text|>All week, The Ringer will be celebrating Good Bad Movies, those films that are so terrible they’re endlessly amusing and — dare we say it? — actually good. Please join us as we give the over-the-top action movies, low-budget romance thrillers, and peak ’80s cheese-fests the spotlight they deserve.

If we were to view all of the Good Bad Movies as parts and pieces that exist parallel to one another, adjacent to one another, in the same plane as one another, and they could snap together to form a kind of Good Bad Movie Universe, then who would be the actor who lorded over all of it? That’s a big question and a hard question because there are so, so, so many Good Bad Movies. But actually it’s a small question and an easy question because the answer is very clear:

Nicolas Cage has acted in more than 80 movies during his career. Mind you, not all of them are Good Bad Movies. That is not the argument here; the quality of his movies covers a wide, big, broad range. Some of them are Actually Good Movies, some of them are Good Bad Movies, some of them are Bad Movies, some of them are Bad Good Movies, some of them are Bad Bad Movies, and some of them fall in the cracks between those categories. So no, the argument is not that every Nicolas Cage movie is a Good Bad Movie. The argument is that, in total, Nicolas Cage is the King of the Good Bad Movie Universe.

Question: How does one become the King of the Good Bad Movie Universe, or even qualify for the title?

Answer: In a previous article, the requirements for a Good Bad Movie were laid out as such:

Enjoyment of the movie must be derived from its badness. Its badness needs to be the thing that creates a sense of bewildered enjoyment.

There must be a pervading sense that those who made the film thought what they were doing was great or at least good. Good Bad Movies have minimal self-awareness. Here are two examples that may help explain this sentiment: 1) MacGruber is not a Good Bad Movie, it’s a tribute to Good Bad Movies, and 2) Fast Five is not a Good Bad Movie, it is a movie that intentionally wades into ridiculousness (and then manufactures a reaction similar to the one a Good Bad Movie elicits naturally).

The movie must have been something of a critical failure when it was released. Critics, god bless them, hold movies

<|begin_of_text|>LexisNexis Group is a corporation providing computer-assisted legal research (CALR) as well as business research and risk management services.[2][3] During the 1970s, LexisNexis pioneered the electronic accessibility of legal and journalistic documents.[4] As of 2006, the company has the world's largest electronic database for legal and public-records related information.[5]

History [ edit ]

LexisNexis office in Markham, a suburb of Toronto, Ontario, Canada

LexisNexis is currently owned by RELX Group (formerly known as Reed Elsevier).[6]

The story of LexisNexis starts in western Pennsylvania in 1956, when attorney John Horty began to explore the use of CALR technology in support of his work on comparative hospital law at the University of Pittsburgh Health Law Center.[7] In 1965, Horty's pioneering work inspired the Ohio State Bar Association (OSBA) to develop its own separate CALR system, Ohio Bar Automated Research (OBAR).[8] In 1967, the OSBA signed a contract with Data Corporation, a local defense contractor, to build OBAR based on the OSBA's written specifications.[8] Data proceeded to implement OBAR on Data Central, an interactive full-text search system originally developed in 1964 as Recon Central to help U.S. Air Force intelligence analysts search text summaries of the contents of aerial and satellite reconnaissance photographs.[9]

In 1968, paper manufacturer Mead Corporation purchased Data Corporation for $6 million to gain control of its inkjet printing technology.[10] Mead hired the Arthur D. Little firm to study the business possibilities for the Data Central technology.[10] Arthur D. Little dispatched a team of consultants to Ohio led by H. Donald Wilson.[11] Mead asked for a practicing lawyer on the team, so the team included Jerome Rubin, a Harvard-trained attorney with 20 years of experience.[12] The resulting study concluded that the nonlegal market was nonexistent, the legal market had potential, and OBAR needed to be rebuilt to profitably exploit that market.[12] At the time, OBAR searches often took up to five hours to complete if more than one user was online, and its original terminals (replaced with CRT text terminals in 1970) were noisy Teletypes with slow transmission rates of 10 characters per second.[13] OBAR also had quality control issues; Rubin later recalled that its data was “

But let’s not for­get that Ric Shin­seki is not just a highly dec­or­ated com­mand­er and wounded war­ri­or, los­ing part of his foot in Vi­et­nam and claw­ing his way back onto act­ive duty against the wishes of Army brass.

It didn’t help his case with the Bush­ies that Bill Clin­ton had ap­poin­ted him Army chief of staff. Moreover, De­fense Sec­ret­ary Don­ald Rums­feld, who didn’t en­joy be­ing chal­lenged, quickly took a dis­like to Shin­seki after sev­er­al policy and strategy dis­agree­ments.

<|begin_of_text|>The FBI has been lobbying top internet companies like Yahoo and Google to support a proposal that would force them to provide backdoors for government surveillance, according to CNET.

The Bureau has been quietly meeting with representatives of these companies, as well as Microsoft (which owns Hotmail and Skype), Facebook and others to argue for a legislative proposal, drafted by the FBI, that would require social-networking sites and VoIP, instant messaging and e-mail providers to alter their code to make their products wiretap-friendly.

The FBI has previously complained to Congress about the so-called "Going Dark" problem – the difficulty of doing effective wiretap surveillance as more communications have moved from traditional telephone services to internet service companies.

Under the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or CALEA, passed in 1994, telecommunications providers are required to make their systems wiretap-friendly. The Federal Communications Commission extended CALEA in 2004 to apply to broadband providers like ISPs and colleges, but web companies are not covered by the law.

CNET reports that in addition to this push from the FBI, the Federal Communications Commission may be looking at reinterpreting CALEA to demand that video and non-telephone-replacement VoIP products such as Skype and Xbox Live be modified to include backdoors that allow FBI surveillance.

The news comes on the heels of another FBI plan that began kicking around in 2010 that would require backdoors in encrypted communication systems. That proposal, which would revisit the encryption wars of the 1990s, has failed to gather administration backing.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>After a disastrous start to pre-season testing, there was more bad news for McLaren today as Fernando Alonso was spotted lurking around other teams’ garages asking if they ‘needed any help’.

Spies within the McLaren camp says that with the MP4-31 in a frequent state of malfunction, the Spanish driver has divided his time between skulking around other teams’ areas asking for work and browsing the internet for a new deckchair.

‘Fernando came into our garage yesterday,’ revealed a source from one front-running operation. ‘He hung around for a bit making small talk then, just as he was leaving, he asked if we needed any help with “you know, driving and stuff”.’

‘Alonso was hanging around our stuff for ages yesterday,’ said an engineer for another well-known team. ‘After a while he looked at our data and loudly said, “Nice times. I wonder if I could do better in this car? Wouldn’t it be funny to find out, perhaps here, or maybe in Melbourne” then he laughed nervously, stopped for a minute, grabbed a spanner off the bench and ran off.’

Deep dive: What makes the Demon so wicked?

by Patrick Rall

At a small Detroit media event, SRT powertrain boss Chris Cowland laid out all of the fine details of the 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon.

The 2018 Challenger Demon had two simple guidelines during development – to run a 9-second quarter mile and to lift the front wheels off of the ground on launch, both in street legal trim.

Once the Demon was given the green light, Dodge added a few initial requirements, including an engine power increase of 10% over the Hellcat Hemi, and launch forces at least 20% greater than the standard Hellcat Challenger. At the same time, the Demon had to be emission-legal in all 50 states (meeting LEV160), meet pass-by noise requirements, and pass strict SRT durability testing.

The result is a 4,200 pound muscle car which will run a 9.65 quarter mile and lift the front wheels off of the ground on a hard launch with an 840 horsepower Hemi – which meets all emission and noise requirements set for by the industry and the company. Most importantly, the new Demon is 100% street-friendly, so in addition to being the quickest production car in the world, it can also serve as a comfortable daily driver.

This was achieved by introducing a new version 6.2-liter supercharged Hemi, with 62% of the content changed from the original Hellcat Hemi — including a new block, crankshaft, connecting rods, pistons, and supercharger assembly.

That 840 horsepower Hemi is mated to a new 8-speed automatic transmission which has been heavily upgraded with a new torque convertor and trans brake. From that stronger transmission, the power travels through a stronger driveshaft to a stronger rear differential with a steeper gear ratio and stronger axles – reaching the ground by means of the lightweight 18” wheels and the Demon-branded Nitto NT05R tires.

We knew all of that when the car was introduced back in April, but below, you will find a detailed rundown of how each key component of the drivetrain in the 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon differs from the Hellcat Hemi.

Induction system

The Air Grabber Hood is a functional hood scoop system which feeds a high volume of cold air to the airbox, along with dual air catchers in the grille (replacing the fog lights) — all feeding the 14.

<|begin_of_text|>EXPERTS have stressed that of course America is genuinely stupid enough to elect a deranged murder clown as its president.

Professor Henry Brubaker, from the Institute for Studies, said: “The question ‘are Americans really stupid enough to do this?’ is, in itself, fairly idiotic.

“In recent years, thanks to some very well made television programmes like Breaking Bad and House of Cards, we may have led ourselves to believe that America is more intelligent than it actually is.

“More than half the population believes in some form of creationism. More. Than. Half.

“Meanwhile, many of them are unable to locate their own state on a map, never mind large, well known foreign countries.

“And then there’s the guns. So many fucking guns. It’s how a great many of them define themselves. That is not a good thing to do with your brain.”

He added: “Anyway, have a lovely evening.”<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>IN the latest entry about women who use profanities and believe it’s good, partly because men do it, Sven writes:

Abigail is essentially denying that separate roles apply to men and women, and that good manners are important. In a nutshell, “If it feels good, do it.”

Women have traditionally been keepers of the home. The home is a place of refuge, a place of safety and comfort, separate from a rough, cruel world. Men ventured out to make a living in that world to preserve the home and hearth. How many men throughout history have felt the soreness and care of a long day at a mine or field or mill melt away as they returned to a loving wife and well-kept house? Introducing swearing into a home pollutes it with the roughness of the outside, which is why a man who swears like a pirate captain’s parrot would hang the curses up outside when he came back to his women folk. It didn’t belong in the house, just like his dirty boots.

On the deck of a ship and on the floor of an oil rig, the Anglo Saxon word that begins with “F” can be like breathing. I’m not saying it is right, but it is appropriate to the context. Women who swear constantly are degrading themselves and their role as women.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

City, Glory share spoils in Hyundai A-League classic

The performance rightfully earned Reddy player-of-the-match honours and Glory have taken their appreciation to the next level with this tribute to their No.1.

<|begin_of_text|>In a business-driven culture obsessed with success, Christians are often tempted to apply secular business models to their spiritual faith. With around 40 hours of our week spent working, our minds are trained to think about productivity, consumerism and prosperity. Bestselling books on management techniques, inspirational TED talks, growth models, leadership seminars and self-help guides can quickly become our main source of knowledge and informationbecoming secondary to the words of Christ.

Not all secular business advice is bad; just realize that it comes from an entirely different paradigm

Business vs. Faith:

Hierarchy vs. Equality

Industry Standards vs. Theological Beliefs

Efficiency vs. Holiness

Board of Directors vs. Spiritual Leaders

Risk Management vs. Missions

Loss Prevention vs. Freely Giving

Marketing vs. Evangelism

Publicity vs. Outreach

Customers vs. Communities

Managers vs. Mentors

Graphs, Data and Research vs. Prayer, Meditation and Revelation

Professionalism vs. Love

Networking vs. Relationships

Physical Growth vs. Spiritual Maturity

Salaried Employees vs. Unpaid Volunteers

Profits vs. Tithing

Fine Print vs. Grace

Sales Growth vs. Spiritual Growth

Success vs. Sacrifice

Money vs. Christ

When Christians have a business mindset about their faith, they often mistake efficiency with effectiveness, but not everything is meant to be fast, quick and streamlined. Take prayer for example:

Almost every church and Christian organization has a website, prayer chain or bulletin page dedicated to peoples prayer requests. The idea is to have as many people praying for you as fast as possiblethis is not a bad thing.

But fewer and fewer Christian ministries are offering a platform that offers the very personal and meaningful opportunity to actually pray with another human beingwithin an intimate and one-on-one context. This model is considered too inefficient. Matthew 18:20 (NIV) states that For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.

Public prayer chains and websites do serve a valuable purpose, and they are a great way to help those in need, but the next time you attend a church or ministry that has a public prayer request list, carefully look it over and analyze what you seemost likely a long list of physical ailments.

Broken legs, sore throats, allergies, aging grandparents, a disease, sickness, a cold and a litany of other physical problems probably make up about 95% of all public prayer lists. Why? Because

<|begin_of_text|>Growing up I loved to watch horror movies. In hindsight, they scared the crap out of me probably because I was too young to watch them. One such movie was the 1986 movie Night of the Creeps. Alien slugs enter through peoples' mouths and eventually take over their bodies. A classic body snatchers style movie that had me worried for few days when talking to close to people. Process hollowing (aka process replacement) is a technique malware uses to overwrite a running process with a malicious code. To me it's the technical equivalent of those alien body snatchers. This post explores process hollowing techniques using the Cuckoo Sandbox.

Process Hollowing (aka Process Replacement)

In my post Prefetch File Meet Process Hollowing I walked through what process hollowing was but for completeness I’ll copied what I wrote below:

Malware uses various techniques to covertly execute code on systems. One such technique is process hollowing, which is also known as process replacement.

The book Practical Malware Analysis states the following in regards to this technique:

"Process replacement is used when a malware author wants to disguise malware as a legitimate process, without the risk of crashing a process through the use of process injection.

Key to process replacement is creating a process in a suspended state. This means that the process will be loaded into memory, but the primary thread of the process is suspended. The program will not do anything until an external program resumes the primary thread, causing the program to start running"

"A malicious process starts a new instance of a legitimate process (such as lsass.exe) in suspended mode. Before resuming it, the executable section( s) are freed and reallocated with malicious code."

In essence, process hollowing is when a process is started in the suspended state, code is injected into the process to overwrite the original data, and when the process is resumed the injected code is executed. Everything about the process initial appears to reflect the original process. Similar to how everything about the person initially appears to be the original person. Upon closer inspection it reveals that everything is not what it seems. The process behaves differently (such as network communications) and the code inside the process is not the original code. This is very similar to the person behaving differently (such as trying to eat you) and the biological material inside the person is not the original biological material.

Tuesday, September 9, 2014 || By Michael Romain

Today, four Maywood firefighters were sent home, pending disciplinary action, for failure to comply with a direct order, according to Chief Craig Bronaugh. A CBS Local report noted that more firefighters could be sent home tomorrow. The firefighters apparently refused to remove American flag decals from their lockers and helmets.

“A representative from Service Employees International Union Local 73, which represents the firefighters, met for an hour with Chief Bronaugh Tuesday afternoon, with the union hoping Chief Bronaugh would modify his order. Instead, he ordered the firefighters sent home immediately, pending disciplinary action,” according to the CBS report.

“Union spokesman Adam Rosen said he is ‘shocked’ that an agency of first responders would enforce such an order the week of Sept. 11.

“The four suspended firefighters said they were told that the order was issued because of racial discord [in] the department. The four, who include two white firefighters, a black firefighter, and a fourth firefighter who is a Cuban émigré, said no such problems exist,” wrote CBS, which also reported that the four firefighters trace the issue “to a decision by several firefighters to replace a tattered American flag last month in one of Maywood’s firehouses. The new flag mysteriously disappeared early Aug. 23. The order on decals was issued last week.”

Although the CBS report indicates that the department “has had no such order in the recent past,” an internal memo released by the Office of Chief Bronaugh noted that this kind of conflict has nonetheless appeared before:

Under no circumstances at anytime are there to be decals/stickers on Fire Department lockers or helmets. Any decals/stickers are to be removed immediately. No inquiry will be entertained regarding this matter.

TO BE READ AT ALL ROLL CALLS THRU SEPTEMBER 10, 2014

This was in response to an inquiry regarding an American Flag being put up in the fire station (replacing a torn and tattered flag that previously existed). That flag was stolen on the very next shift day. Firefighters were upset that the flag was stolen and in response placed American Flag decals on their personal lockers in the stations.

This is not the first time that a flag incident has occurred in the Maywood Fire Department. Approximately 10 years ago, all American Flag decals were removed from all of the department vehicles and

The Egyptian government denied that terrorism is even a possibility, with Egyptian despot Abdel Fatah al-Sisi proclaiming:

“When there is propaganda that it crashed because of Isis, this is one way to damage the stability and security of Egypt and the image of Egypt. Believe me, the situation in Sinai – especially in this limited area – is under our full control.”

However, it soon came out that the person in charge of Sharm el-Sheikh airport, where the Russia plane had landed before taking off again, had been “replaced” – oh, but not because of anything to do with the downing of the Russian passenger plane! As the Egyptian authorities put it:

“Adel Mahgoub, chairman of the state company that runs Egypt’s civilian airports, says airport chief Abdel-Wahab Ali has been ‘promoted’ to become his assistant. He said the move late Wednesday had nothing to do with media skepticism surrounding the airport’s security. Mahgoub said Ali is being replaced by Emad el-Balasi, a pilot.”

Laughable, albeit in a sinister way, and yet more evidence that something wasn’t quite right: after all, everyone knows the Egyptian government does not have the Sinai, over which the plane disintegrated in mid air, under its “full control.” ISIS, which claimed responsibility for the crash hours after it occurred, is all over that peninsula.

Still, the denials poured in, mostly from US government officials such as Director of National Intelligence James “Liar-liar-pants-on-fire” Clapper, who said ISIS involvement was “unlikely.” Then they told us it couldn’t have been ISIS because they supposedly don’t have surface-to-air missiles that can reach the height attained by the downed plane. Yet that wasn’t very convincing either, because a) How do they know what ISIS has in its arsenal?, and b) couldn’t ISIS or some other group have smuggled a bomb on board?

The better part of a week after the crash, we have this:

“Days after authorities dismissed claims that ISIS brought down a Russian passenger jet, a U.S. intelligence analysis now suggests that the terror group or its affiliates planted a bomb on the plane.

“British Foreign Minister Philip Hammond said his government believes there is a ‘significant possibility’ that an explosive device caused the crash. And

Today's template is just an example of how to turn a flat app screen into a 3D mockup, and animate it. We also integrated a popular resource, Points of Interest.

Inspiration came from Prismic.io.

Creating the structure

The HTML is structured in 2 main <div> elements (.cd-product-intro and.cd-product-mockup ) – the first containing the product intro (title, action buttons..) and the second the mockup (and the points of interest) – wrapped inside a section.cd-product.

<section class="cd-product"> <div class="cd-product-intro"> <h1><!-- Product name --></h1> <p><!-- Product description --></p> <div class="cd-triggers"> <a href="#0" class="cd-btn">Download</a> <a href="#cd-product-tour" id="cd-start" class="cd-btn">Start</a> </div> </div> <!-- cd-product-intro --> <div id="cd-product-tour" class="cd-product-mockup"> <img src="img/cd-app-image.png" alt="Preview image"> <!-- mockup image --> <ul class="cd-points-container"> <li class="cd-single-point"> <a class="cd-img-replace" href="#0">More info</a> <div class="cd-more-info cd-left"> <h2><!-- Point of interest title --></h2> <p><!-- Point of interest description --></p> <a href="#0" class="cd-close-info cd-img-replace">Close</a> </div> </li> <!--.cd-single-point --> <!-- other points of interest here --> </ul> <!--.cd-points-container --> <div class="cd-3d-right-side"></div> <div class="cd-3d-bottom-side"></div> </div> <!--.cd-product-mockup --> </section> <!--.cd-product -->

Two additional <div> elements (.cd-3d-right-side and the.cd-3d-bottom-side ) have been used to create the 3d sides of the mockup, while the.cd-product-mockup::before pseudo-element has been used to create the shadow.

<|begin_of_text|>President Obama has won reelection, and his administration has asked state officials to decide by Friday, November 16, whether their state will create one of Obamacare’s health-insurance “exchanges.” States also have to decide whether to implement the law’s massive expansion of Medicaid. The correct answer to both questions remains a resounding no.

State-created exchanges mean higher taxes, fewer jobs, and less protection of religious freedom. States are better off defaulting to a federal exchange. The Medicaid expansion is likewise too costly and risky a proposition. Republican Governors Association chairman Bob McDonnell (R.,Va.) agrees, and has announced that Virginia will implement neither provision.

There are many arguments against creating exchanges.

First, states are under no obligation to create one.

Second, operating an Obamacare exchange would be illegal in 14 states. Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, and Virginia have enacted either statutes or constitutional amendments (or both) forbidding state employees to participate in an essential exchange function: implementing Obamacare’s individual and employer mandates.

Third, each exchange would cost its state an estimated $10 million to $100 million per year, necessitating tax increases.

Fourth, the November 16 deadline is no more real than the “deadlines” for implementing REAL ID, which have been pushed back repeatedly since 2008.

Fifth, states can always create an exchange later if they choose.

Sixth, a state-created exchange is not a state-controlled exchange. All exchanges will be controlled by Washington.

Seventh, Congress authorized no funds for federal “fallback” exchanges. So Washington may not be able to impose Exchanges on states at all.

Eighth, the Obama administration has yet to provide crucial information that states need before they can make an informed decision.

Ninth, creating an exchange sets state officials up to take the blame when Obamacare increases insurance premiums and denies care to the sick. State officials won’t want their names on this disastrous mess.

Tenth, creating an exchange would be assisting in the creation of a “public option” that would drive domestic health-insurance carriers out of business through unfair competition.

Eleventh, Obamacare remains unpopular. The latest Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that only 38 percent of the public supports it.

Twelfth, defaulting to a federal exchange exempts a state’s employers from the employer mandate — a tax of $2,000 per worker per year (the tax applies to companies with more than 59 employees, but for such

<|begin_of_text|>The U.S. One Cent coin, or penny, has almost no purchasing power today. The cost of making the pennies (1.66 cents each) is higher than face value, and the melt value of pennies ranges from more than two cents for the pre-1982 copper pennies, to nearly a full cent for the copper plated zinc pennies. However, the penny is a very sentimental coin to most Americans, and many people fear that eliminating the penny would raise prices because things would need to be rounded up to the nearest nickel.

Both sides in the penny debate make some good points, and the solution is far from being an easy decision. This article takes a look at the issues involved in the pro-penny and the anti-penny debate so that you can make up your mind about where you stand on this critical matter.

Background

The United States has eliminated a small denomination coin in the past with relatively little trouble. In 1857, the Mint stopped making the half-cent coin, partly because the cost of making it had exceeded its face value, and somewhat because it was considered to be too small a denomination that it was no longer needed.

Back in 1857, the half-cent had the purchasing power that would translate to well over ten cents today, so in some ways, it was akin to our eliminating the dime. Commerce continued without any major hiccups, even though the one-cent copper coin suddenly shrunk from a hefty, over an inch in diameter piece of copper that weighed almost 11 grams, to a penny that was less than half the weight and 40% smaller.

Other significant changes in U.S. coinage occurred without any catastrophic effects on commerce. In 1965 the U.S. Mint stopped making 90% silver dimes, quarters, and half dollars and changed them over to base metal clad versions. The outer shell was made out of 75% copper and 25% nickel bonded to a core of pure copper. A few people groused about it, but commerce continued unabated.

There have been several other minor changes in the coin metal composition. These composition changes ranged from temporary wartime alterations during World War II, to more permanent switches like using zinc instead of copper for the penny. More recently, the mint changed the cupro-nickel clad dollar coin (the Susan B. Anthony) to the "golden dollar" type used in the Sacagawea and Presidential Dollar types. None of these changes caused any significant problems in commerce.

“You should resign. You should give back the money you took while this scam was going on and you should be criminally investigated,” Warren told Stumpf, after he admitted under Warren’s grilling he hadn’t yet been held personally accountable for the actions of his employees.

The Democratic senator also forced Stumpf, who was under questioning from the Senate banking committee over his bank’s handling of the scam, to admit that no senior executives have been held accountable for the actions of the low-level bankers.

Some forged signatures and committed identity theft to open fraudulent bank accounts, while under pressure to meet sales targets or be fired. These employees, Stumpf explained earlier in the committee hearing, were “well-paid,” making between $30,000 and $60,000 a year. Stumpf made $19.3 million in 2015.

“This just isn’t right,” Warren said. “You squeezed employees to the breaking point” to drive up the stock price and your compensation, she said, referencing the bank’s fierce drive to “cross-sell” or make customers open up multiple accounts. “You went on television to blame thousands of $12-an-hour” workers.

“It’s gutless leadership,” Warren said.

Last week Stumpf in a televised interview appeared to blame low-level workers for this behavior, which was widespread throughout the bank ― 5,300 employees were fired for their involvement.

A cashier who “steals a handful of $20s” is held accountable, Warren said. Bank executives aren’t.

“The only way Wall Street will change will be if executives face jail time” for criminal behavior, she said.

In the Wells Fargo scandal, people were mistakenly charged fees, saw their credit ratings fall, got credit cards in the mail they never asked for or just were confused.

The bank said that it had fired the thousands of employees from 2011 to 2016 for engaging in the practice. Stumpf tried on Tuesday to make the case that this was a few bad apples, explaining the firings amounted to 1 percent of the bank’s 100,000 retail bankers every year.

The incentive to open fake accounts was strong: Wells Fargo bankers received quarterly bonuses for cross-selling. Stumpf said on Tuesday that the lowest-paid bank workers make $12 an hour

Justin Bieber faces two criminal charges following an alleged altercation in Perth County.

OPP say they were called to Line 40 east of Road 106 – east of the singer's hometown of Stratford and northeast of Shakespeare – shortly before 3 p.m. last Friday in response to a crash between a minivan and an ATV, both of which were carrying two people.

“It appeared that one of the occupants of the van and the operator of the ATV had words,” Const. Kees Wijnands told reporters Tuesday afternoon.

“There was an altercation that took place, and as a result of that, we ended up arresting Justin Bieber.”

In an email to The Canadian Press, the pop star’s lawyer blamed the paparazzi for the incident.

“Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez’s peaceful retreat in Stratford this weekend was unfortunately disrupted by the unwelcome presence of the paparazzi,” Brian Greenspan said.

“Mr. Bieber and Ms. Gomez have fully cooperated in the police investigation. We are hopeful that this matter will be quickly resolved.”

Los Angeles-based lawyer Gloria Allread said she's representing two "victims" in the incidents, but did not indicate whether her clients are photographers.

Police likewise would not say if they believed the minivan’s occupants to be paparazzi, but did confirm that Bieber was driving the ATV.

“Justin’s demeanour, when we dealt with him, was very positive,” Wijnands said.

Bieber, 20, posted pictures of himself and on-and-off girlfriend Gomez riding an ATV online on Friday.

That same day, he and his father posted pictures of themselves riding horses.

Bieber faces charges of dangerous driving and assault. Police say he was released from custody on a promise to appear in court.

His next court date is set for Sept. 29.

No injuries were reported as a result of the crash.

<|begin_of_text|>Ravers were left shocked at Corsica Studios this week after a local techno DJ spontaneously combusted with rage after a member of the crowd referred to his set as ‘Tech-House’.

The DJ, whose name was later revealed to be Dave Lester, 32, from Lewisham, had been playing a sub-standard selection of repetitive tunes when a member of the crowd proceeded to the DJ booth. The crowd member was then seen talking into Lester’s ear, at which point the convulsions began at once.

“He started shaking uncontrollably straight away,” crowd member Jody Smith told us afterwards. “If I heard correctly, the dude leaned over and said to him, ‘I’m really enjoying your selection: top tech-house music.’ Then the DJ’s mouth started frothing with blood and foam, his eyes seemed to pop out of their sockets with anger, and his fists clenched as if he had suddenly become some hideous techno version of the Incredible Hulk. He then collapsed twitching onto the floor, screaming in a blood-curdling voice the words ‘Jeff Mills is not Tech-House!’ over and over again.”

As the convulsions continued, onlooker Andrew Harris, who later identified himself as a friend of the deceased, was one of the first on the scene.

“The sound technician has already jumped in and begun to administer CPR,” Harris told us, “but Dave simply squealed that the pumps to his chest were not being delivered in four to the floor time and physically threw him to one side. The sound technician responded by observing the fact that a techno tempo is too slow for effective CPR. It was at that point Dave simply exploded all over the concerned onlookers and over the decks.”

Lester was taken to hospital immediately afterwards, but was confirmed dead upon arrival. Doctors issued the following statement: “We’ve known about this condition, known in the medical journals as Techno Snobbery, for some time now, but this is the first time that we’ve ever seen anyone spontaneously combust with rage due to it.

“We would offer the following advice to techno DJs,” the statement continued. “Techno Snobbery is a condition that can often show no symptoms for many years, yet it has been documented that it can emerge suddenly at any time due to the slightest provocation. Therefore, techno DJs should remember that genre categorisations are largely permeable and superfluous, and that a fan referring to their music as Tech-House is therefore not a derogatory comment and can, in some circumstances

back to Music Humor Page

Author unkown. (Wish we knew, 'cause it's really funny)

1. Most Blues begin, "Woke up this morning..."

2. "I got a good woman" is a bad way to begin the Blues, unless you stick something nasty in the next line like, "I got a good woman, with the meanest face in town."

3. The Blues is simple. After you get the first line right, repeat it. Then find something that rhymes... sort of: "Got a good woman with the meanest face in town. Yes, I got a good woman with the meanest face in town. Got teeth like Margaret Thatcher, and she weigh 500 pound."

4. The Blues is not about choice. You stuck in a ditch, you stuck in a ditch--ain't no way out.

5. Blues cars: Chevys, Fords, Cadillacs and broken-down trucks. Blues don't travel in Volvos, BMWs, or Sport Utility Vehicles. Most Blues transportation is a Greyhound bus or a southbound train. Jet aircraft and company motor pools ain't even in the running. Walkin' plays a major part in the blues lifestyle. So does fixin' to die.

6. Teenagers can't sing the Blues. They ain't fixin' to die yet. Adults sing the Blues. In Blues, "adulthood" means being old enough to get the electric chair if you shoot a man in Memphis.

7. Blues can take place in New York City but not in Hawaii or any place in Canada. Hard times in Minneapolis or Seattle is probably just clinical depression. Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City are still the best places to have the Blues. You cannot have the blues in any place that don't get rain.

8. A man with male pattern baldness ain't the blues. A woman with male pattern baldness is. Breaking your leg cause you were skiing is not the blues. Breaking your leg 'cause a alligator be chompin' on it is.

9. You can't have no Blues in a office or a shopping mall. The lighting is wrong. Go outside to the parking lot or sit by the dumpster.

10. Good places for the Blues:

a. Highway

b. Jailhouse

c. An empty bed

d. Bottom of a whiskey glass

11. Bad places for the Blues:

<|begin_of_text|>Gov. Rick Perry was in Connecticut last week touting all the advantages of doing business in Texas, which seem to be:

You don't have to pay taxes.

You don't have to pay employees.

And don't have to pay attention to any of those pesky government regulations.

It sounded just swell. The only disadvantage I could see was, well, you have to live in Texas.

Texas is a lot different from Connecticut. Moving there will require cultural adjustments akin to resettling in a different country. For all those who will be following Gov. Perry back to the Lone Star State, here are a few things to know about your new home.

Size Matters

Texas is big, really big. It is larger than all of New England, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Illinois combined, and is the second most populous state after California (which doesn't include cattle, of which there are some 16 million.)

Brewster, the largest county in Texas, is larger than Connecticut, and the King Ranch in South Texas is larger than Rhode Island.

Texas Has Some Strange Local Laws

In Texas, it is illegal for children to have unusual haircuts.

In Texas, it is illegal to milk another person's cow (That may be illegal here, too.)

In Texas, it is illegal for one to shoot a buffalo from the second story of a hotel. (Another reason it is always better to be on the ground floor.)

In Texas, it is illegal to take more than three sips of beer at a time while standing. (I don't know how they enforce this.)

In Texas, it is Illegal to indecently expose yourself or swear in front of a corpse. (OK, I can see where flashing a corpse would be unacceptable, but swearing?)

In Texas, it is illegal to emit obnoxious odors while in an elevator. (I'd have to check but I believe they hang you for that.)

Texas Is Home To A Lot Of Weather Extremes

The highest temperature ever recorded in Texas was 120 degrees, the lowest minus 23.

Texas averages 139 tornadoes a year, most in the United States.

Texas is dry, its latest drought being the worst since 1789.

Texas is getting hotter, last summer was the hottest on record.

Texas Has Issues

Texas is tied with Mississippi for having the highest percentage of U.S. workers in minimum-wage jobs.

Texas has the country's fourth-highest poverty rate.

Texas ranks first for children without health insurance.

So, advice for those

There is no one who is not affected by the harsh realities of life, and the question “why do bad things happen to good people?” is one of the most difficult questions in all of theology. God is sovereign, so all that happens must have at least been allowed by Him, if not directly caused by Him. At the outset, we must acknowledge that human beings, who are not eternal, infinite, or omniscient, cannot expect to fully understand God’s purposes and ways.The book of Job deals with the issue of why God allows bad things to happen to good people. Job was a righteous man (Job 1:1), yet he suffered in ways that are almost beyond belief. God allowed Satan to do everything he wanted to Job except kill him, and Satan did his worst. What was Job’s reaction? “Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him” (Job 13:15). “The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised” (Job 1:21). Job did not understand why God had allowed the things He did, but he knew God was good and therefore continued to trust in Him. Ultimately, that should be our reaction as well.Why do bad things happen to good people? As hard as it is to acknowledge, we must remember that there are no “good” people, in the absolute sense of the word. All of us are tainted by and infected with sin (Ecclesiastes 7:20; Romans 3:23; 1 John 1:8). As Jesus said, “No one is good—except God alone” (Luke 18:19). All of us feel the effects of sin in one way or another. Sometimes it’s our own personal sin; other times, it’s the sins of others. We live in a fallen world, and we experience the effects of the fall. One of those effects is injustice and seemingly senseless suffering.When wondering why God would allow bad things to happen to good people, it’s also good to consider these four things about the bad things that happen:1) Bad things may happen to good people in this world, but this world is not the end. Christians have an eternal perspective: “We do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day. For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far

Of course there is a setback with wearing a regular face mask for hard common labor, which is that it is really effort having to breathe with an air filter, making job more stressful, and triggering exhaustion to establish in far more swiftly.

By selecting one of the current PAPR masks (Powered Air Purifying Respirators) over traditional versions, there are a lot of outstanding benefits to be had. The first and the majority of quickly apparent among these is that rather of the laborer needing to strive to take a breath via a filter, the electric battery powered air pump connected to the PAPR masks drives air through a thorough filter system, and delivers it directly in to the face mask. The air is amazing in the PAPR mask as a result of the length of the pipe permitting disturbance to clear up away, and relying on the filter made use of in the system nearly all bits can be taken out.

The following significant perk for employees utilizing a PAPR mask when functioning is that since all the hefty elements - the electric motor and filters - are consisted of within a belt installed unit, the mask itself is too much lighter compared to a regular model. This makes it a lot a lot more comfortable to use for long durations of time, as well as lessens the quantity of muscular tissue exhaustion felt by users when they are utilizing the PAPR mask.

There are a selection of different PAPR masks available, and although they all discuss the very same standard attributes of having the cleanser and air pump affixed to the belt and the mask as a separate thing, they can be utilized for different objectives, and customers ought to consider exactly what their specific requirements are just before spending for among these items.

The most significant advantage of a PAPR mask over a hood with an air filter is that it is a wonderful bargain much more versatile for the user, since it is lightweight, and supplies exceptional presence. With a conventional soft hood mask, the peripheral vision of the user is decreased, making them unsuitable to wear within a harmful atmosphere.

To get the maximum gain from putting on a PAPR mask, you need to make certain that it is appropriately suited, working appropriately, and regularly examined and maintained. The air purifying pump should be kept clear of blockages, and the user ought to examine that the mask has a good seal around their

Following criticism of Mohammad Amir's early return to cricket after his spot-fixing ban, the ICC today announced the left-arm quick would only be allowed to bowl right-arm offspin in a long-sleeved top so "no one can ever forget he's a bit shifty".

There had been fears letting Amir back ahead of schedule sent a message his past behaviour was completely forgiven, but this latest sanction, the ICC believes, will ensure the Pakistani youngster will continue to be widely stigmatised because, in the words of one Dubai official, "everyone knows what these offspinners get up to".

Speaking outside the Indian Supreme Court, Head of the ICC Ethics Enforcement Unit, N Srinivasan, explained the idea: ''A lot of people were a bit miffed at us letting Amir come back early, so we decided to add an extra punishment to guarantee no one will ever, ever consider him above suspicion. We couldn't think of anything more likely to ruin his reputation in the current climate than forcing him to play as an offspinner.

"Well, we were toying with the idea of making him India's overseas bowling coach, but in the end we decided even a convicted felon didn't deserve that." The deputy head of the ICC Ethics Enforcement Unit, N Srinivasan, claimed that this was in no way another clever ruse from the Big Three to prevent other countries from having any decent bowlers whatsoever: ''We haven't insisted Wayne Parnell becomes an offspinner, have we?'' he argued convincingly.

Amir himself was understandably upset about the plan, taking to social media to suggest the shame of being imprisoned for spot-fixing was nothing compared to the disgrace of having to bowl offspin in 2015. After listing his profile location as "a small village", the fallen idol sent out a number of distraught tweets claiming he "couldn't stand all the whispering and finger-pointing'' to which he'd be subjected if he was forced to send down the same category of delivery as Mohammad Hafeez and Saeed Ajmal. Later he wrote: "It's one thing to be hated for deliberately conceding a no-ball and shattering the dreams of millions of cricket fans across the world. It's quite another to suffer the humiliation of having a portly man in an ill-fitting umpire's uniform declare your arm is a bit too bendy." New to Twitter, Amir eventually realised the

he election of Donald J. Trump revealed a bitterly divided nation and a large body of voters fed up with the status quo: fed up with a perennially ailing economy and a shrinking middle class; fed up with an overly intrusive state that crippled businesses with innumerable regulations and sought to redistribute wealth; fed up with a massively burdensome and insupportable debt; fed up with a president mentored by revolutionaries and malcontents who seemed not to like ordinary Americans much if at all; fed up with a leader who paid court to hostile foreign powers while alienating or outright betraying America's traditional allies; fed up with a president who spoke of heartland Americans as bitter people who cling to their guns or religion or bigotry; fed up with a president who told business owners "You didn't build that," called the Fort Hood terrorist attack an episode of workplace violence, and announced at the United Nations that the future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam; and most of all, perhaps, fed up with an administration that placed the whole country in thrall to political correctness, making a range of important subjects off-limits for discussion on pain of job loss or public disgrace. Many of these voters felt that America had changed beyond all recognition, had lost its core values, and that neither Republican nor Democrat politicians offered any real resistance to that, or even seemed to notice.Donald Trump promised to change everything: to make America great again; to revive American industry; to put Americans back to work and make it possible for them to feed their families and to have prosperity once again; to reduce burdensome taxes and over-regulation of businesses; to renew American patriotism and the traditional family; to stop pretending that children do just as well without a father and money; to stop pretending that masculinity is toxic; to make it acceptable and normal once more to love God and to celebrate America's Judeo-Christian heritage; to decrease the mass immigration that is changing the face of America for the worse; to root out the Muslim Brotherhood sympathizers who have been given key positions in the American administration; to halt illegal immigration and to put a stop to the sanctuary cities that make a mockery of American laws; to rebuild the American military and to signal American power, not acquiescence, to America's foes; to honor American veterans in a manner appropriate to their service; to renew ties with America's traditional allies; and to vigorously protect America from domestic and foreign terrorism.

<|begin_of_text|>LOS ANGELES—In anticipation of the release today of 42, the new Jackie Robinson biopic, moviegoers speculated that the film about the first African-American to play major-league baseball in the modern era most likely includes a scene in which a bunch of people yell horrible racist things at him and he’s upset and wants to fight back but he doesn’t. “There’s probably this part where he walks into the stadium for the first time, and everyone’s shouting at him because he’s black and they don’t like that, and he wants to lash out, but then his friend grabs his arm and says, ‘Beat ’em on the field, Jackie,’ and so he just keeps walking,” said local man Clint Harrison, 36, who predicted that the movie might also include a scene in which Robinson wants to give up because everyone’s so mean to him, but then his strong-willed wife consoles him and tells him he needs to keep playing because it’s not just about him anymore. “And at the beginning, all the guys on his team aren’t sure if they like him, but then he plays really, really good and some of them start to like him, and after a while they win a bunch of games, and by the end everybody likes him. Yeah, just like that.” Harrison further conjectured that 42 is probably a bad movie.

Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday morning to taunt the North Korean government, saying it was “looking for trouble” and threatening to “solve the problem” (presumably of North Korea’s missile testing) without China. The written attack came after a US aircraft carrier was diverted to the region over the weekend, ahead of the April 15 birthday of North Korea’s founding father, traditionally a time to show off military might.

www.navy.mil The USS Carl Vinson, recently diverted to the Korean Peninsula.

The North Korean government, meanwhile, says it is ready for a fight. “If the US dares opt for a military action, crying out for ‘pre-emptive attack’ … the DPRK is ready to react to any mode of war desired by the US,” a North Korean foreign ministry spokesman said on Tuesday.

Trump kept going later Tuesday, saying in an interview with Fox Business the US was sending “an armada” to the region to challenge Kim that was “very powerful,” and hinting that submarines might be involved too.

North Korea, a politically isolated dictatorship of 25 million people, has a history of belligerent statements and sometimes fatal skirmishes with neighboring South Korea. The world became used to provocations from North Korea in decades past, but in recent years the threats have increasingly been backed by alarming advances in weapons capabilities that threaten other nations as well.

“We now have both sides playing at brinksmanship.”

Introducing Trump’s foreign policy doctrine of provocative statements (sometimes not followed up on) to the already unstable situation is worrisome, foreign policy experts say. “We now have both sides playing at brinksmanship,” said Ken E. Gause, director of the international affairs group at CNA, a defense think tank in Washington, DC. The situation is “very precarious and very concerning.”

If Trump’s provocative statements are part of a larger, multi-step plan to stabilize and de-nuclearize North Korea, then that is “brilliant,” Gause said. But “if it is just haphazard, it is pretty dangerous.”

“The default response when North Korea is challenged is to turn up the volume,” said Scott Snyder, the senior fellow for Korea studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. And because North

<|begin_of_text|>Of course Donald Trump over-promised for his first 100 days. What presidential candidate hasn't?

During last year's campaign, Trump spoke frequently of all the things he would do almost immediately upon entering the Oval Office. He'd repeal Obamacare, reform the tax code, destroy ISIS, build a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, fix the nation's roads and bridges, take care of veterans, deport criminal illegal immigrants, and much, much more.

By the last weeks of the campaign, Trump actually dialed back some of his promises. On October 22, he traveled to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania to announce his " Contract with the American Voter," which formalized his pledges for the first 100 days.

The "Contract" was a single piece of paper. The front listed 18 actions Trump would take under his executive authority as president, and the back listed ten pieces of legislation he would introduce in Congress.

Now, three months into the Trump administration, the front and the back of the Contract are two very different stories.

On the executive action front, Trump has kept a significant number of his promises:

Candidate Trump promised to "begin the process" of selecting a Supreme Court Justice to replace Antonin Scalia. As president, Trump did just that, and Neil Gorsuch is now on the Court.

Candidate Trump promised to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. As president, he did it.

Candidate Trump promised to require that "for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated." As president, he did it.

Candidate Trump promised to "lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks" on the Keystone Pipeline and other infrastructure projects. As president, he did it.

Candidate Trump promised to "begin removing the more than two million criminal illegal immigrants" in the U.S. As president, he did it.

On other issues, Trump has kept front-page promises, but with decidedly mixed results. The most significant of those is his pledge to "suspend immigration from terror-prone regions." Trump has done it — twice — only to see his executive orders tied up in the courts. His first try was botched, while the second try will likely survive judicial scrutiny.

Trump also promised to "cancel all federal funding" for so-called sanctuary cities. He has begun to do so — the Justice Department is beginning to threaten to withdraw some grant money — but the promise was overbroad and will likely never be fully kept.

In addition, Trump promised to impose a "five-year ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they

You don’t have to be a man to enjoy thick juicy pork chops stuffed with the most incredible stuffing made with bacon, apples and blue cheese. Can you say flavor bomb? These pork chops will rock your world. Your life will literally be better for having these stuffed puppies!

But you know this isn’t a novelty, let’s face it, pork and apples go together like chocolate and marshmallows, like Abbott and Costello, like fish and chips, like cream and sugar. I think you get it. Like wisdom and age? Toast and butter? Starsky and Hutch? Heart and soul? Sticks and stones? Peanut butter and jelly? I think I’ll stop here. Nuts and Bolts! Meat and Potatoes! Pen and paper! Salt and pepper! My fav, mac and cheese! I promise, I’m done.

But when you add bacon and blue cheese, well you’ve elevated the flavors to a whole new dimension. I just love saying that. A whole new flavor dimension. I promise I didn’t have anything to drink, oh maybe just a glass of wine, that’s all.

Anyway, the stuffing! Simple. Apple. Bacon. Blue Cheese. Shallots. Garlic. Done.

I used pork loin chops, but the bone in pork chops would work just as well, just make sure that whatever pork chops you use, that they are cut pretty thick, about an inch. Cut a little pocket inside each pork chop, just use a sharp knife, make sure you don’t cut yourself, and then stuff those puppies with all your stuffing, about 1/2 cup of stuffing in each. Doesn’t matter if it sticks out, it’s all good.

<|begin_of_text|>The Peace Tower (in French: Tour de la Paix), also known as the Tower of Victory and Peace (in French: tour de Victoire et de Paix),[1] is a focal bell and clock tower sitting on the central axis of the Centre Block of the Canadian parliament buildings in Ottawa, Ontario. The present incarnation replaced the 55-metre (180 ft) Victoria Tower after the latter burned down in 1916, along with most of the Centre Block; only the Library of Parliament survived. It serves as a Canadian icon[2] and had been featured prominently on the Canadian twenty-dollar bill directly adjacent the queen's visage, until the change to polymer.

Characteristics [ edit ]

Designed by Jean Omer Marchand and John A. Pearson, the tower is a campanile whose height reaches 92.2 m (302 ft 6 in),[3] over which are arranged a multitude of stone carvings, including approximately 370 gargoyles, grotesques, and friezes, keeping with the Victorian High Gothic style of the rest of the parliamentary complex. The walls are of Nepean sandstone and the roof is of reinforced concrete covered with copper.[4]

One of four grotesques at the corners of the Peace Tower

At its base is a porte-cochere within four equilateral pointed arches, the north of which frames the main entrance of the Centre Block, and the jambs of the south adorned by the supporters of the Royal Arms of Canada. Near the apex, just below the steeply pitched roof, are the tower's 4.8 m (16 ft) diameter clock faces,[4] one on each of the four facades. The mechanical workings of the timepiece were manufactured by the Verdin Company and are set by the National Research Council Time Signal. One level below, running around the circumference of the tower's shaft, is an observation deck.[3] This was the highest accessible space in Ottawa until the early 1970s; the Peace Tower dominated the Ottawa skyline, as a strict 45.7 m (150 ft) height limit was placed on other buildings. That limit, however, was later rescinded, leading the Peace Tower to lose its distinction as the city's tallest structure. Cantilevered out at each of the four corners of the tower, at the level of the observation platform, are four 2.5 m (8 ft 4 in) long, 75 cm (2 ft 6 in)

Hey, you can only buy 1 of these.

No, you're not seeing things. Out of our desperate attempt to be rich love for giving you options, we've added a little something extra for today. Come on in and check it out!

First, yes, that is a tattoo of a Toshiba Quad-Core Laptop, and second, I refuse to let you shame me for it.

In fact, it's just one of many tributes to its 8GB memory, 750GB hard drive, and USB 3.0 connectivity inked onto my body. And oh, the stories each one could tell:

On my left forearm: a picture of my Toshiba surrounded by roses and a banner that says "Mom".

On my right forearm: a picture of my Mom surrounded by roses and a banner that says "Toshiba".

Across the front of my neck: QUAD-CORE in Old English script. Lot of bleeding when I got this one. A lot of bleeding.

On my chest: two majestic bluebirds lifting my Toshiba into Heaven, surrounded by the gleaming rays of a sun whose radiant, smiling visage looks just like Beau Bridges (the truly talented one in that family). I admit, I got this one when I was drunk.

On my back: exactly like the one on my chest except the Toshiba is wearing a sombrero. I got this one when I was drunk in Tijuana.

On my right bicep: four open Toshiba laptops laid on their sides and arranged to form an ancient Sanskrit symbol of life and good fortune called a "swastika".

Right above my left ankle: a little bitty Toshiba with a purple-and-blue butterfly on its screen. You never forget your first Toshiba tat. I got this one when I pledged my sorority.

<|begin_of_text|>YALTA, CRIMEA—In what is being called the worst environmental disaster in the region’s history, millions of policy proposals gushed into the Black Sea on Thursday after a Brookings Institution think tanker ran aground off the coast of Crimea. “Cleanup crews are working around the clock to contain this massive flood of position papers on economics and global development,” said Brookings Institution president Strobe Talbott, adding that booms had been brought to the site to halt the spread of the nonpartisan research while skimmers had been deployed to collect the policy briefs from the ocean’s surface in hopes of preventing currents from dispersing them over a far greater area. “We’re doing our very best to limit the exposure of marine habitats to the analyses of sub-Saharan energy infrastructure, universal basic income, and automation in the labor market, but it could be months before we know the full extent of the damage.” Talbott went on to say that the Brookings Institution had already pledged $200 million toward cleanup efforts thanks to generous donations from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Hutchins Family Foundation, and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.

<|begin_of_text|>WASHINGTON, D.C. – “Fire them! Fire them all!” raved Gen. James Amos, foaming at the mouth as he was escorted to a waiting police cruiser in a straitjacket late Friday. Amos is en route to a high security psychiatric facility following a firing spree during which he attempted to relieve the entire United States Marine Corps.

It began Thursday morning, when Amos unexpectedly fired his aide. Sources believe the firing was prompted when Amos saw an article in The Marine Corps Times that suggested he was becoming increasingly unhinged. The article, which contained information that caused Amos to believe it was leaked from sources close to him, alleged that he believed he was surrounded by invisible enemies who wished to ruin his legacy as Commandant through leaks to the media, sexual assaults, safety incidents, war crimes, alcohol-related incidents, wasting water, and even their own suicides.

When Assistant Commandant Gen. John Paxton spoke up on behalf of the young officer, Amos fired him as well, believing him to be a co-conspirator. The situation soon spiraled out of control, with Amos running down the halls kicking in doors, and firing everyone he encountered. Victims of this portion of the spree included several of Amos’ deputy commandants, large portions of their staffs, one very startled janitor, and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).

“Are you a Marine?” Amos asked, wild-eyed, not recognizing the member of the Armed Forces Committee.

“Hell yes I am,” replied Blumenthal, who left the Marine Corps Reserve at the rank of sergeant in the mid-1970s.

“You’re fired too!” Amos screamed into his face before running farther down the hall.

At this point, Lt. Gen. Richard Mills and Sergeant Major Gary Weiser, the leadership of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) and the highest ranking Marines left in the building, attempted to rally the remaining Marines against the Commandant’s administrative onslaught. Weiser gathered all the Marines he could find, and assembled them at a rally point identified by Mills, a hallway adjacent to Amos’ rampage.

“Okay, here’s the plan,” Mills explained. “The Commandant’s center of gravity is his ability to fire Marines. His critical vulnerability is that he needs to be able to see us and speak to us to exercise that ability, and he’s got a limited field of vision. We’re going to exploit that by breaking into multiple groups and catching him

<|begin_of_text|>Why Recall? Here’s a look back at Tom McKay’s first 14 months in office:

1. In a sexual harassment special investigation by former NJ Deputy Attorney General Lee Vartan, Tom McKay was found to have sexually harassed the Township clerk and a rent leveling board volunteer by describing them as lesbians and calling them “man-haters”. McKay never apologized to either woman, but rather blames his actions on his political opponents. The investigation costs Lopatcong taxpayers more than $10,000 and the council must censure the mayor. CensureResolution

2. Tom McKay is served with a Tort Claims notice of intent to sue subjecting the Township and its taxpayers to substantial liability for his sexual harassment behavior.

3. Tom McKay gavels Councilwoman Maureen McCabe in a public meeting and yells at her to “shut up.” Again, he refuses to take responsibility for losing his temper.

4. Tom McKay publicly posts his personal “10 Commandments” for behavior at public meetings, but when a resident posts beside it her 10 criticisms of his public demeanor, he has them removed. The town receives legal notice from the resident’s lawyer that the Mayor violated her First Amendment rights.

5. Tom McKay secretly secured access to the Township’s security cameras without the knowledge or consent of the Council. He also accepted those services as a gift from a Township vendor in violation of his terms of office.

6. Lopatcong Township loses its credit status with many of its vendors due to the Mayor’s refusal to pay bills on time. Many vendors take a “payment in advance” policy with the Township.

7. Tom McKay refused to consider the request led by Councilwoman Ciesla to refinance to Township’s debt obligation, for spite not business, and COST Lopatcong taxpayers $200,000.

8. Tom McKay’s politically motivated banking decisions COST Lopatcong $20,000 in lost revenues.

9. Tom McKay offered to trade his vote to reappoint the Township’s attorney and engineer for promises that they will not contribute to his opponents’ political campaign.

10. Tom McKay replaces a long time member of the Township Planning Board with a non-US citizen political ally who, at public meetings, refuses to Pledge Allegiance to the US Flag.

11. Tom McKay attempts to appoint his personal sexual harassment defense lawyer as the Township’s new labor lawyer. When the Council objects, he sues them.

12. Tom McKay attempts to appoint his personal attorney as the Township’s new general attorney

<|begin_of_text|>Somerset Bridge is a small bridge located in the western parish of Sandys, in Bermuda, connecting Somerset Island with the mainland. The stone bridge is walled solid, save for a narrow arch near one of its banks that allows small boats to pass underneath. There is enough headroom for a motorboat to pass through comfortably but not a sailboat. To allow a sailboat with a tall mast to squeeze through, a section of the motorway over the arch was replaced with wooden planks that could be raised creating a mini drawbridge. This section is just 32 inches wide, and is widely believed to be the smallest working drawbridge in the world.

Photo credit

The original bridge dates back to 1620, and although the bridge was largely rebuilt in the mid 20th century, much of the original stonework remains. The bridge was originally raised using a hand crank, but now consist of two cantilevered half-spans made of thick timber panels. The panels can be grabbed by the sides and lifted to create a narrow gap just wide enough for the mast of a sailboat to pass through. Judging by the size of the gap, I believe it takes a fair amount of skill to navigate the gap without mishap. Often a sailor has to be assisted in opening the drawbridge and making the passage safely, so it’s not uncommon to find sailboat captains calling upon pedestrians for help.

Although not quite an attraction, the bridge’s unique reputation has earned it a place on the reverse of Bermuda’s $20 bills issued in 2009.

<|begin_of_text|>GETTING GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE WAY: President Donald J. Trump has done more to stop the Government from interfering in the lives of Americans in his first 100 days than any other President in history.

President Trump has signed 13 Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions in his first 100 days, more than any other President. These resolutions nullified unnecessary regulations and block agencies from reissuing them. Since CRA resolutions were introduced under President Clinton, they’ve been used only once, under President George W. Bush.

The Wall Street Journal editorial: “So far the Trump Administration is a welcome improvement, rolling back more regulations than any President in history.”

Former President Jimmy Carter broke away from his own party, coming to President Donald Trump’s defense and saying, “The media have been harder on Trump than any other president.”

In a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times published on Saturday, Carter seemed to ally himself with Trump, criticizing the media for its coverage of the new administration.

[lz_ndn video=”33150334″]

“I think the media have been harder on Trump than any other president certainly that I’ve known about,” Carter told The Times. “I think they feel free to claim that Trump is mentally deranged and everything else without hesitation.”

In addition, Carter also aligned himself with Trump on the issue of whether or not football players should stand while the national anthem is being played before games. Trump reignited the controversy in late September when he urged football coaches to bench players who choose to protest against racial injustice in the country by kneeling instead of standing during the anthem. Since then, National Football League ratings have plummeted while many sports fans expressed their disapproval of kneeling during the anthem and politicizing a patriotic tradition.

“I think they ought to find a different way to object, to demonstrate. I would rather see all the players stand during the American anthem,” Carter said.

The former president also pushed back against one of the prevailing narratives Democrats and liberal-leaning media outlets have pushed in the days following Trump’s astonishing Election Day victory: whether or not the Russians affected voting outcomes. In addition, Carter said he wasn’t bothered particularly with Trump’s desire to cultivate a stronger and more diplomatic relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“At the Carter Center,” the former president said, “we deal with Putin and the Russians quite frequently concerning Syria.”

Carter added: “I don’t think there’s any evidence that what the Russians did changed enough votes, or any votes” during the 2016 presidential election.

Noting that he and his wife, Rosalynn, both voted for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) over Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during the primaries, Carter didn’t have many kind words to offer the Clintons. When The Times’ Maureen Dowd compared the Carter Center to the Clinton Foundation, Carter bristled.

<|begin_of_text|>Two Texas high-school football players stood with athletes across the country against police brutality and discrimination by protesting during the national anthem. Immediately after, they were told to hand in their uniforms.

Sophomore Cedric Ingram-Lewis and his cousin Larry McCullough were kicked off their team at Victory & Praise Christian Academy, the Houston Chronicle reported. The pair didn't play in the Friday night game for their private church-affiliated football program in the Houston suburb Crosby.

Ingram-Lewis raised his fist during the anthem while McCullough took a knee. Coach Ronnie Mitchem kicked them off the team when the anthem ended.

Local high school football players kicked off team after protest during anthem (by @chroncoleman) https://t.co/mATIDFymj3 via @houstonchron — Matt Young (@Chron_MattYoung) September 30, 2017

"He told us that disrespect will not be tolerated," Lewis told the Houston Chronicle. "He told us to take off our uniform and leave it there."

The coach told the Chronicle that he wanted players to participate in protests by kneeling after a touchdown or distributing pamphlets about the issues they're calling attention to—not by taking a knee during the anthem, like players across the country.

"That was my point of view," Mitchem told the Chronicle. "Like I said, I'm a former Marine. That just doesn't fly and they knew that. I don't have any problem with those young men. We've had a good relationship. They chose to do that and they had to pay for the consequences."

NFL protests against police brutality started over a year ago with Colin Kaepernick, but escalated last week when President Donald Trump ranted against the mostly black athletes protesting. Trump said that NFL owners should fire athletes who protested and called players who knelt during the anthem a "son of a bitch."

"I'm definitely going to have a conversation because I don't like the way that that was handled," Lewis's mother, Rhonda Brady, told the Chronicle. "But I don't want them back on the team. A man with integrity and morals and ethics and who truly lives by that wouldn't have done anything like that."<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>The error-chain crate (docs) is a new crate for dealing with Rust error boilerplate. It provides a few unique features:

No error is ever discarded. This library primarily makes it easy to “chain” errors with the chain_err method.

method. Introducing new errors is trivial. Simple errors can be introduced at the error site with just a string.

Errors create and propagate backtraces.

I think the lack of the above are widespread problems with Rust error handling, so I’m interested to hear what people think about this solution. It is inspired by quick-error (and in fact includes a hacked up version of it for internal use) as well as Cargo’s internal error handling techniques. This library is used by rustup for error handling.

One note about usage that isn’t included in the docs: the chain_error! macro recurses deeply, so you’ll probably need to use the little-known #![recursion_limit = "1024"] macro on crates that import it.

For detailed usage information read the docs, which are reproduced in part below.

Declaring error types

Generally, you define one family of error types per crate, though it’s also perfectly fine to define error types on a finer-grained basis, such as per module.

Assuming you are using crate-level error types, typically you will define an errors module and inside it call error_chain! :

// Define the error types and conversions for this crate error_chain! { // The type defined for this error. These are the conventional // and recommended names, but they can be arbitrarily chosen. types { Error, ErrorKind, ChainErr, Result; } // Automatic conversions between this error chain and other // error chains. In this case, it will e.g. generate an // `ErrorKind` variant called `Dist` which in turn contains // the `rustup_dist::ErrorKind`, with conversions from // `rustup_dist::Error`. // // This section can be empty. links { rustup_dist::Error, rustup_dist::ErrorKind, Dist; rustup_utils::Error, rustup_utils::ErrorKind, Utils; } // Automatic conversions between this error chain and other // error types not defined by the `error_chain!`. These will be // boxed as the error cause and wrapped in a new error with, // in this case, the `ErrorKind::Temp` variant. // // This section can be empty. foreign_links { temp::Error, Temp, "temporary file error"; } // Define additional `ErrorKind` variants

<|begin_of_text|>NEW YORK — It's all about the goals in MLS. Literally.

The league announced on Wednesday a new wrinkle to its playoff format that will be implemented this season, honoring goals scored as the first tiebreaker when two or more teams are even on points in the standings.

In fact, goals scored currently has the Houston Dynamo (35 goals scored) ahead of Sporting Kansas City (28 goals scored) atop the Eastern Conference, although both clubs are tied on 40 points.

Total goals scored was only the third tiebreaker last season with head-to-head record and goal differential taking precedence. In fact, head-to-head record was the first criteria used to rank teams tied on points in 2011, but it became less relevant with the switch to an unbalanced, conference-based schedule.

The league's Board of Governors approved the following new set of tiebreakers to be used beginning with the current 2012 season "in part to encourage attacking play," according to a league statement:

1) Most total goals scored

2) Greatest goal differential

3) Fewest disciplinary points

4) Most road goals scored

5) Greatest road goal differential

6) Most home goals scored

7) Greatest home goal differential

8) Coin toss (for 2 teams) or drawing of lots (3 or more teams)<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>
