<|begin_of_text|>India's inflation rate has slumped to the lowest level of modern times and there is much talk that the Reserve Bank of India will lower interest rates to stimulate the economy--that might take a little longer than many are predicting. We must always distinguish between general inflation, a general upward pressure on the price level, and specific price changes. This current low inflation rate looks much more like the effect of the latter, thus interest rate changes aren't so warranted.

Growth in industrial production fell to a three-month low in May while consumer price index (CPI)-based inflation declined below a stipulated floor of 2 per cent in June, providing the Reserve Bank of India leeway to cut the policy interest rate in August.

The RBI certainly has the power and the room to cut rates, yes, but that's not quite the correct policy decision here. Which is whether the RBI should cut interest rates as a result of the low inflation and that's much less certain:

Data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on Wednesday showed retail inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), rose an annual 1.5% in June, slower than previous month's 2.2%. This was the slowest pace of increase since the government unveiled the new retail inflation series in 2012. The previous lows were in 1999 and in 1978 under a different series.

My point being that CPI isn't really the correct inflation measure to be using when considering interest rate changes and inflation. The US Federal Reserve, for example, uses the PCE rate although that's not really the important point here. CPI, PCE, RPI, they all have their slight differences and are useful in slightly different manners. But there's a much more important difference we need to take account of:

Aside from the steep fall in food inflation, which has been downplayed by the RBI time and again, the steady and consistent fall in core inflation (non-food and fuel) could find favour with the central bank.

It's this difference between core and non-core inflation that matters. It does depend upon which government and which statistical system we're talking about as to whether all produce core and non-core PCE and RPI and CPI, but in general the distinction is understood between the two different types of inflation rate:

Data on Wednesday showed headline consumer price inflation fell to 1.5 percent in the year to June from an annual 2.2 percent a month ago and below forecasts for a 1.6 percent reading

<|begin_of_text|>Russia's Consumer Price Index (CPI) in October fell again to an extraordinary low of 2.7% year-on-year down from the already low 3% seen in September, Rosstat statistics agency said on November 7.

Inflation has strongly overshooting the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) target of 4% set for 2017, diving from double-digit price growth in less than two years.

However, the CBR keeps pointing to stubborn inflationary expectations and other medium-terms inflationary risks and sticks to the moderately tight monetary policy despite the pressure from the government to support growth with lower interest. The current rate is by far the lowest in post-Soviet history but the population remain stubbornly convinced that the fall is temporary, according to the CBR surveys. The result is inflationary pressure remains lurking and the CBR is reluctant to accelerate rate cuts until the population expectations of price rises relent.

The CBR decided to cut the key interest rate by 25bp at the board of directors meeting on October 27, in line with the expectations.

A more aggressive cut of 50bp would have meant that the CBR could prepare to tighten the policy again in the beginning of 2018, some analysts suggested. However, the CBR decided to abstain from an aggressive move and cut the rate by the minimum step of 25bp to 8.25%.

Last week Alfa Bank argued that "at the moment we do not agree with the government’s concerns that low inflation is the result of the tight monetary policy of the CBR."

The analysts that forecasted inflation easing to 2.8% in October maintained that "medium-term inflationary risks are considerable and that the CBR should thus not accelerate interest rate cuts."

However, VTB Capital previously argued that "the incoming data for October and November might nudge the Board to opt for a more ambitious cut of 50bp," while noting that "this would call for surprises from inflation reports, banking stats and economic activity data to combine into a convincing case."

The CBR expects inflation to end 2017 at 3.5-3.8%, while the Ministry of Economic Development that needs lower interest rates to help its ambitious 2.1% growth outlook expects 2.7-3.2% inflation in 2017.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>The government has admitted that 800,000 more households stand to lose out under its flagship welfare scheme than previously thought.

In a revised impact assessment of its universal credit scheme, which will replace six of the seven main means-tested benefits and tax credits for those of working age, the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) says that 2.8 million households will get a lower entitlement to benefits. That compares with a figure of 2 million announced in October 2011 after officials first considered how the changes would affect claimants.

The sums are large. About 800,000 households will see an average loss of £137 a month, while the 300,000 hardest hit families will lose as much as £300 a month. About 200,000 lone parents will also receive lower awards under the new scheme than the current system.

The much greater impact is due to a combination of factors – the deteriorating economic environment appears to have added £700m to the costs of the policy according to the Office for Budget Responsibility, while officials also concede that universal credit is less generous than first envisaged. The chancellor's decision last week to raise benefits at a rate lower than the consumer price index will also have affected the scheme.

The revised impact assessment was released late on Tuesday. Ellen Broome, policy director at the Children's Society, said: "We have some serious concerns about how it will affect some of the most disadvantaged children and families. Some of our poorest working families will struggle to afford vital childcare. Our evidence also reveals that many disabled children and disabled lone parents will be significantly worse off."

Labour also questioned whether there were not dwindling savings from the scheme, pointing out that the 2011 impact assessment claimed that universal credit would reduce administrative costs by £500m due to its "reduced complexity". This, says the opposition, has been revised downwards to £200m.

Liam Byrne, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: "Universal credit is now set to be a car crash for 2.8 million families who will be worse off than under the current system. That's nearly 50% more than when plans were first published."

"The very people this government has let down are being asked to pick up the tab for ministers' failure. 300,000 families on middle and modest incomes will lose £3,600 a year – that's £300 a month. We were promised a welfare revolution but universal credit is descending into universal chaos. Instead of fixing welfare reform, this government is now just

<|begin_of_text|>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Both President Barack Obama and Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have made opening offers in negotiations to resolve the “fiscal cliff.

Here is a look at the two proposals, which are aimed at averting a more drastic combination of tax increases and spending cuts that economists say could cause a recession:

REPUBLICAN OFFER

House Republican leaders on Monday called for $2.2 trillion in new deficit reductions over 10 years.

When counting deficit reductions enacted last year, anticipated savings from winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and some interest savings, the package would amount to $4.6 trillion in reductions over a decade, according to House Republicans.

The offer made the following proposals to achieve $2.2 trillion in new deficit reductions over 10 years:

* $800 billion in new revenue through tax reform;

* unspecified healthcare program savings of $600 billion;

* other savings from changes to unspecified mandatory spending programs of $300 billion;

* tying cost-of-living increases for federal benefit programs to the Consumer Price Index to get savings of $200 billion;

* and further unspecified savings to domestic spending programs of $300 billion.

House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and six other House Republican leaders made the offer on Monday in a letter to Obama.

DEMOCRATIC OFFER

The White House on Thursday proposed raising tax revenues by nearly $1.6 trillion, in line with what Obama has said is needed for long-term deficit reduction of nearly $4.4 trillion over 10 years.

The administration also sought $200 billion in economic stimulus from a combination of investments including infrastructure spending, extension of a payroll tax cut and jobless benefits.

The White House would also continue individual income tax cuts from the administration of former Republican President George W. Bush for all but the wealthiest earners.

Obama’s negotiators also sought the ability to raise the nation’s borrowing limit unilaterally. At present, Congress must approve an increase in the debt ceiling.

The administration’s proposal would delay across-the-board spending cuts for a year. In exchange the administration agreed to make $600 billion in spending cuts to entitlement programs.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Cryptography’s most familiar application is perhaps the sending of coded messages: Alice wants to communicate some information to her distant confidante Bob. She worries that her message might be intercepted by an eavesdropper, so she encrypts it in a way that only Bob can decipher. But there exists a whole range of complementary cryptographic tasks—such as online auctions and secure voting—in which Alice and Bob want to guard against attacks not from eavesdroppers but from each other.

To develop algorithms to perform those other tasks, cryptographers use a building block called bit commitment: Alice chooses a bit (a 1 or 0) to be revealed later; Bob wants to ensure that Alice can’t change her mind in the meantime, while Alice wants to ensure that Bob has no way to learn which bit she chose until the appointed time.

Although quantum theory is the basis for perfectly secure encryption, it offers no path to secure bit commitment. But a different law of physics, the impossibility of faster-than-light signaling, has now come to the rescue, and Anthony Martin, Hugo Zbinden, and their colleagues at the University of Geneva have implemented a protocol for achieving bit commitment for a full 24 hours.

For the protocol to work, Alice and Bob work with trusted partners Amy and Brian, respectively. Bob and Brian take turns exchanging data with Alice and Amy, in such a way that each exchange falls outside the forward light cone of the previous one. Each of Alice’s and Amy’s answers depends on both the data they receive from Bob or Brian and on information Alice and Amy agree on in advance, including the bit they want to commit. For Alice to cheat and change the bit at any time in the middle of the protocol, she’d need to know what happened in Amy’s most recent exchange with Brian; relativity prevents her from having that information.

In their 24-hour implementation, Martin and colleagues repeated the exchanges for 5 billion rounds, one every 17 µs, with a total of 162 GB of data. According to two theory papers from the past year, the probability that the protocol is vulnerable to cheating is less than one in a billion. (E. Verbanis et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 140506, 2016.)<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation rose in April for the first time in 10 months, but as the increase was partly due to a late Easter holiday, which pushed up transport costs, it was unlikely to alter interest rate expectations.

Official data also showed that growth in house prices eased in March, potentially tempering concerns about a bubble brewing in the property market although some more up-to-date surveys have shown prices picking up again.

The consumer price index rose more than expected to an annual rate of 1.8 percent in April, from 1.6 percent in March, which had been its lowest level in more than four years, the Office for National Statistics ONS said.

It was the first rise in the CPI since June 2013 and above a Reuters poll forecast for inflation of 1.7 percent in April.

Sterling hit a 16-month high against the euro and rose against the dollar before giving up much of its gains as market expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates in about a year’s time remained largely intact.

The opposition Labour party jumped on Tuesday’s figures, saying they showed the government’s complacency about the “cost of living” crisis facing many Britons as wage growth has lagged inflation.

Economists however saw little change in price pressures.

“Easter effects aside, the latest release provides little evidence of significant or broad-based price pressures,” said Victoria Clarke, an economist with bank Investec.

Factory gate inflation in April was weaker than economists’ predictions.

Higher airfares linked to Easter and other transport costs helped push up consumer prices, the ONS said. Easter fell in April this year but in late March last year.

Offsetting those rises, food price growth was the lowest in eight years as a mild spring kept vegetable prices down.

Core CPI, which excludes food costs and other items but does include transport costs, rose 2.0 percent, its strongest rate since September last year.

House prices - which are an increasing source of concern for the Bank of England - were up 8.0 percent on the year in March, slowing from a 9.2 percent rise in February, the ONS also said.

Prices in London, however, were up 17 percent on the year, although that was less than a 17.8 percent increase in February, the biggest increase since 200

<|begin_of_text|>Intelligence, cognitive ability or cognitive performance is usually measured by a battery of tests that aim to quantify skills such as memory and analytical ability. There is loads of variation between people in how they perform on such tests, and these differences can be due to genetic and environment factors, and their interplay.

In research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS) today, we show three genetic variants in humans that can account for a couple of IQ points – but before you get excited, these are only three variants out of likely thousands.

The genetics of cognitive performance

While a measure of “intelligence” can be controversial, cognitive performance scores are widely used because of their predictive ability. Educational attainment, income, job performance and health are all correlated with cognitive performance.

By comparing the cognitive performance between family members, including comparisons between identical and non-identical twins, scientists are able to quantify the contribution of genetic and environmental causes of individual differences.

Decades of research have shown that genetic factors account for about half of the causes of individual difference in cognitive performance, and recent studies using unrelated people have confirmed that a substantial proportion of individual difference is due to genetic factors.

So, we know now that cognitive performance is heritable, but where are the genes? Despite considerable attempts to find genes for cognitive performance, no specific genes had been found and replicated.

One reason for this puzzle is that there are a lot of genes involved – thousands, even – and their individual gene effect sizes are tiny. Past studies couldn’t find them because sample sizes were not large enough to detect genes with statistical significance.

So how did we overcome this problem?

Last year, a huge international collaborative study of more than 126,000 people correlated millions of genetic variants with educational attainment and discovered three genetic variants associated with it.

Education attainment is correlated with cognitive performance, so given these two observations, we tested the genetic variants for education attainment with their associations with cognitive performance, which we report in PNAS today.

We tested 69 genetic variants from the educational attainment study (of almost 107,000 people) in independent samples of 24,000 people who had a cognitive performance score. This two-stage strategy is called a “proxy-phenotype method” since educational attainment is a proxy phenotype (an observable characteristic or trait) for cognitive performance.

The essence of this design was to piggy-back on a much larger study from a correlated trait (educational attainment) to pre-select a small number of genetic variants. These were then tested for association with cognitive performance –

It got it horrendously, embarrassingly wrong: in fact the economy has grown even faster after the vote, as consumers kept on spending.

But there were two forecasts they got right.

First, they said that the pound would fall sharply, by around 12-15%.

Second, that this would push up inflation - the annual rate at which prices across the economy are changing - by 2.3%-2.7% more than if the UK had voted to stay.

The pound did indeed depreciate considerably after the Leave vote - in fact, based on the latest figures, it is 13% weaker than before the vote (against a basket of currencies).

And now the Office for National Statistics has reported that inflation - as measured by the consumer price index - has risen to 2.3%.

:: Household squeeze as inflation reaches three-and-a-half year high

This is the highest rate of change since late 2013, and is also the first time the measure has been above the Bank of England's target in that period.

There is little doubt that this was caused primarily by the fall in the pound (which in turn was caused by the referendum vote - indeed, it plummeted on referendum night itself).

Because the UK relies so heavily on imported goods (we have a trade deficit, remember?) it is particularly sensitive to changes in the currency.

When the pound rises, prices fall; and when the pound falls, prices rise.

That's what happened in 2008 when the pound fell amid the financial crisis; that ultimately pushed up inflation to around 5%. It's what's happening now.

Indeed, a glance at the costs manufacturers are paying for imported materials underlines that story.

In the three years up until June 2016, those prices were falling on a year-on-year basis.

They suddenly started to rise following the referendum.

Over the past three months the annual rate hit 18.8% - the highest level since 2008.

That would imply inflation has even further to rise.

Indeed, as we reported a couple of weeks ago, timely measures of prices (collected from the internet) suggest prices might already be rising by more than 3%.

Now, on the one hand, inflation at or around target is no cause for panic. Indeed, a little bit of inflation is actually quite a good thing.

A carbon footprint can be measured for an individual or an organization, and is typically given in tons of CO 2 -equivalent (CO 2 -eq) per year. For example, the average North American generates about 20 tons of CO 2 -eq each year. The global average carbon footprint is about 4 tons of CO 2 -eq per year (Figure 1).

Figure 1. National carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per capita. (2005). (Source: UNEP/GRID-Arendal Maps and Graphics Library)

An individual’s or organization’s carbon footprint can be broken down into the primary and secondary footprints. The primary footprint is the sum of direct emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels for energy consumption and transportation. More fuel-efficient cars have a smaller primary footprint, as do energy-efficient light bulbs in your home or office. Worldwide, 82% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are in the form of CO 2 from fossil fuel combustion (Figure 2).

The secondary footprint is the sum of indirect emissions of greenhouse gases during the lifecycle of products used by an individual or organization. For example, the greenhouse gases emitted during the production of plastic for water bottles, as well as the energy used to transport the water, contributes to the secondary carbon footprint. Products with more packaging will generally have a larger secondary footprint than products with a minimal amount of packaging.

In U of A President Indira Samarasekera’s blog, she explained tuition fees for domestic undergraduate and graduate students will increase by one per cent.

“The Board passed a motion to increase general tuition for domestic undergraduate and graduate students by one per cent (CPI), the maximum allowable increase as set by government,” she explained in a blog post dated Dec. 13.

Samarasekera also explained that after “considerable debate” the board also approved a five per cent overall increase to undergraduate international tuition and fees.

“This increase includes the one per cent increase for CPI. The additional four per cent increase will be used to fund programming and services for international students as well to address other inflationary pressures faced by the university,” she said in the blog.

Tuition for graduate international students will increase by one per cent.

“As you know, the Provost’s Office is in the process of reviewing graduate student experience, enrolment, and funding, a review which includes, of course, the experience and support we provide international graduate students. Once the full review is complete, we will determine at that point whether we will bring forward proposals changing domestic and international graduate tuition and support.”

The Provost’s Office also launched an online feedback form to get input from faculty, staff and students.

All increases and fees will be effective as of Sept. 1, 2014 for all students.

Samarasekera also said Acting Provost Martin Ferguson-Pell and the senior team decided to partially restore funding for graduate assistantships in the Science and Arts faculties. The funding was reduced in the 2013-2014 budget, however, provincial reinvestment of $14.4 million in the university’s operating grant meant the institution could allocate $2.4 million in the 2014-2015 budget to graduate assistantships.

<|begin_of_text|>Inflation accounting comprises a range of accounting models designed to correct problems arising from historical cost accounting in the presence of high inflation and hyperinflation.[1] [2] For example, in countries experiencing hyperinflation the International Accounting Standards Board requires corporations to implement financial capital maintenance in units of constant purchasing power in terms of the monthly published Consumer Price Index. This does not result in capital maintenance in units of constant purchasing power since that can only be achieved in terms of a daily index.

Historical cost basis in financial statements [ edit ]

Fair value accounting (also called replacement cost accounting or current cost accounting) was widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but historical cost accounting became more widespread after values overstated during the 1920s were reversed during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Most principles of historical cost accounting were developed after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, including the presumption of a stable currency.[3]

Measuring unit principle [ edit ]

Under a historical cost-based system of accounting, inflation leads to two basic problems. First, many of the historical numbers appearing on financial statements are not economically relevant because prices have changed since they were incurred. Second, since the numbers on financial statements represent dollars expended at different points of time and, in turn, embody different amounts of purchasing power, they are simply not additive. Hence, adding cash of $10,000 held on December 31, 2002, with $10,000 representing the cost of land acquired in 1955 (when the price level was significantly lower) is a dubious operation because of the significantly different amount of purchasing power represented by the two numbers.[4]

By adding dollar amounts that represent different amounts of purchasing power, the resulting sum is misleading, as one would be adding 10,000 dollars to 10,000 Euros to get a total of 20,000. Likewise subtracting dollar amounts that represent different amounts of purchasing power may result in an apparent capital gain which is actually a capital loss. If a building purchased in 1970 for $20,000 is sold in 2006 for $200,000 when its replacement cost is $300,000, the apparent gain of $180,000 is illusory.

<|begin_of_text|>Experts have roundly criticized BC Premier Christy Clark’s recent home ownership grant policy. A key part of the negative reaction has been based on fears that interest free grants will increase housing prices and drive a further wedge between incomes and housing costs, a divide already plaguing the Vancouver and lower mainland markets.

These worries about the divide between housing prices and incomes are well founded.

Trends in residential property prices and housing affordability between 2005 and 2016 paint a grim picture in both Vancouver and the city of Toronto. This article looks at those trends, analyzing the mortgage cost of homes in these two cities and in comparison to Canada more broadly.

More specifically, it looks at the number of weeks of labour time it would take workers making the average weekly wage to make a mortgage purchase in each city. The data are startling.

Methodology:

The nominal dollar cost of a house or a condo today is much higher than it was 10 or 20 years ago. Indeed, it is even higher than what it was just a couple of years ago. There exists a number of indices that look at the price of housing by deflating the nominal dollar price of a house by the consumer price index (CPI) to get an idea of how fast housing prices are rising relative to the general rise in prices of consumer goods.

This article does something different. It calculates how many weeks of labour time, paid at average provincial weekly rates, it takes to purchase an average residential property. In order to do so, it makes some key assumptions.

The calculations in this article concern changes in the mortgage costs of residential property purchases. Here, I assume that the entire price of the properties (inclusive of mortgage fees and financing costs) were paid through a mortgage financed with 5-year mortgage loans amortized over 15 years. In other words, it assumes no initial down payment. By looking at the weeks of labour time, the analysis assumes that all of a person’s income is going towards financing their mortgage. Of course, we know people have many other fixed costs and financial responsibilities. But this measure gives us an informative picture of the glaring gap between incomes and housing prices.

Of course, since we don’t know what interest rates and wage rates will be after 2016, the numbers for the years after 2011 are estimates based on an extrapolation of recent data for these two variables. The calculation also assume, after 2011, a return towards trend values in the case of interest rates). Finally, the data is based on yearly averages. So

Overweight The overweight range according to the body mass index (BMI) is the area on the chart where BMI > 25 Specialty Endocrinology

Being overweight or fat is having more body fat than is optimally healthy. Being overweight is especially common where food supplies are plentiful and lifestyles are sedentary.

As of 2003, excess weight reached epidemic proportions globally, with more than 1 billion adults being either overweight or obese.[1] In 2013 this increased to more than 2 billion.[2] Increases have been observed across all age groups.

A healthy body requires a minimum amount of fat for proper functioning of the hormonal, reproductive, and immune systems, as thermal insulation, as shock absorption for sensitive areas, and as energy for future use. But the accumulation of too much storage fat can impair movement, flexibility, and alter the appearance of the body.

Classification

The degree to which a person is overweight is generally described by the body mass index (BMI). Overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 or more, thus it includes pre-obesity defined as a BMI between 25 and 30 and obesity as defined by a BMI of 30 or more.[3][4] Pre-obese and overweight however are often used interchangeably, thus giving overweight a common definition of a BMI of between 25–30. There are, however, several other common ways to measure the amount of adiposity or fat present in an individual's body.

Body mass index

The body mass index (BMI) is a measure of a person's weight taking into account their height. It is given by the following formula: BMI equals a person's weight (mass) in kilograms divided by the square of the person's height in metres. The units therefore are kg/m2 but BMI measures are typically used and written without units.

BMI provides a significantly more accurate representation of body fat content than simply measuring a person's weight. It is only moderately correlated with both body fat percentage and body fat mass (R2 of 0.68).[5] It does not take into account certain factors such as pregnancy or bodybuilding; however, the BMI is an accurate reflection of fat percentage in the majority of the adult population.

The body volume index (BVI) was devised in 2000 as a computer, rather than manual, measurement of the human body for obesity and an alternative to the BMI

BVI uses 3D software

Jay L Zagorsky is an economist at Ohio State University.

Prom season is now upon us, the key social event of most people’s high school experience. My youngest child is preparing to attend her first senior prom and a steady supply of fancy dresses has begun to appear in our house. As my credit card bills climbed ever higher, I began to wonder, how has the price of the prom changed over time?

For teenagers scraping together money from minimum-wage jobs and informal work like babysitting and snow shoveling, the question has immediate relevance because the price determines if they can afford to go. For parents of teens, the question is relevant because the prom is another expensive bill competing with lots of other financial priorities.

Even for people not directly connected to the high school experience, the price of the prom is important. The U.S. is a melting pot of different cultures, religions and ethnic groups. Tying these disparate groups together is a variety of common shared experiences, such as celebrating the 4th of July, eating turkey at Thanksgiving and, for teens, experiencing the prom.

When the prom’s price goes down, more teens can afford to go, and it becomes a more inclusive shared experience. When the price rises, however, the prom becomes a more exclusive social event attended mostly by those with wealthier parents, resulting in fewer common shared experiences.

Cereal and donuts

It is possible to get a sense of the changing price of going to the prom using government data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides detailed monthly information on the trend in prices over time for a vast number of items purchased by the typical family.

The government does not care, directly, about the price of the prom – unfortunately it has yet to craft a “prom index.” However, using a subset of the inflation data we can see that proms are actually getting relatively cheaper over time.

The typical 17-year-old going to the prom this year was born in 1998. Since then, the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, has increased 45 percent. That means the average item a family bought for $1 in 1998 now costs $1.45. Each month the CPI releases hundreds of detailed price indexes so that anyone can see, for example, if the price of breakfast cereal is rising faster than, say, donuts over time.

A new tool developed by Jeff Kaufman, a 27-year-old programmer at Google in Cambridge, allows apartment renters to visualize where Boston’s most and least expensive apartments are. Kaufman's heat map displays the cost per bedroom relative to each Boston neighborhood.

The map indicates the most expensive apartments in Boston tend to hover between Back Bay and Downtown Boston and on into the Seaport District. The region’s least expensive apartments are found near Mattapan, Dorchester and Revere.

Areas of Cambridge along the Red Line also display expensive apartment listings, where the booming tech economy is squeezing commercial rents for startups.

Kaufman's first iteration of the heat map originated in 2011 when he was looking for a place to live.

"I was looking for an apartment and didn't have a good sense of how expensive different parts of the city were," Kaufman says. "I wanted to have a map that gave you a rough idea of the city and how expensive they were."

Reddit user “yiseowl” helped explain the heat map by overlaying the MBTA train map over Kaufman’s. The juxtaposition shows some correlation between rent and MBTA accessibility.

According to Kaufman’s data, which he took from apartment rental search engine Padmapper, the average cost per bedroom in 2013 is $1,314. In 2011, the average cost per bedroom was $1,141.

This is a much greater increase than inflation. The [Consumer Price Index] in June 2011 was 225.922 while the December 2012 one was 229.594, so you would expect $767/room then to turn into $780/room now instead of the $895 we actually see.

These readings, plus snapshots of car buying, gun ownership, food-stamp demand and more, make up the “Off the Grid Indicators” report that creator Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at the New York–based global brokerage Convergex, argues pushes economic sleuthing beyond the obvious payrolls report or consumer price index.

Government data often strip out volatile food prices, but market strategist Nicholas Colas and company say doing so miscalculates inflation expectations among shoppers.

Highlights from the current edition of the now five-year-old quarterly report, especially when combined with traditional government- and industry-issued data and anecdotes, indicate the Fed can be slow with raising interest rates, Colas said. The Fed’s next two meetings come later this month and then in June.

Convergex even trademarked its “Bacon Cheeseburger Index,” an evenly split minibasket of the popular beef-bacon-and-cheese combo that can serve as a relatable inflation gauge. Government data often strip out volatile food prices, but Colas and company say doing so miscalculates inflation expectations among food-conscious shoppers.

As of the first quarter, thanks to price declines in all three of these cholesterol commodities, a bacon cheeseburger now costs 5.1% less than a year ago, the Convergex report shows.

A look back at the Bacon Cheeseburger Index to 1990 finds that it is actually a decent indicator of deflation risk. Prior periods when the BCI turned resoundingly negative (3% or more) since 1990 include: 2009 (financial crisis); 1998 (emerging market and Long Term Capital collapse), and 1992 (the lead up to the Iraq invasion). In each case, the Fed was cutting interest rates, not raising them.

“So should the Fed actually use the Bacon Cheeseburger Index? Of course not. But does it help explain in one compact, if anecdotal, form why the Federal Reserve is happy to hold off on rate increases? I think it does,” said Colas.

<|begin_of_text|>During the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) press conference last week, one exchange stood out. Asked about a meeting scheduled by the finance ministry in New Delhi to discuss the RBI’s policy, the governor of India’s central bank, Urjit Patel, replied: “The meeting did not take place. All the MPC members declined the request of the finance ministry for that meeting."

The MPC is the Monetary Policy Committee, a six-member council that sets India’s benchmark interest rates. It’s a new institution, less than a year old; Patel’s predecessor, Raghuram Rajan, had full authority to set interest rates himself. But it seems India’s government is not as comfortable as many had hoped with this new arrangement—summoning the MPC members to the finance ministry before they decided rates was widely seen as an attempt to interfere in their decision.

So it’s a great relief that the RBI stood firm. Its independence has been questioned of late, partly because of the circumstances in which Rajan left, under pressure from lawmakers in New Delhi, and partly because of its supine acceptance of the government’s controversial decision in November to withdraw 86% of India’s currency from circulation. The government should never have asked for the meeting; but, given that it did, the members of the MPC were right to refuse.

Also read: India’s war of the Mandarins leaves companies as victims

In any case, they knew what the government was likely to say: “Please, for the love of God, cut rates." India is confronting a growth slowdown that is born, most agree, out of a sustained crisis in private investment. It doesn’t take a meeting with the government for the MPC to know that. Yet it has ignored the pleas of officials—and of many in the private sector—and kept rates steady.

This determination emerges from another relatively recent reform: an agreement between the central bank and the government to shift to targeting consumer price inflation. A clear goal for the RBI—rather than a vague admonition that it should care about growth, prices and the exchange rate all at once—adds to its independence and clarifies its approach to monetary policy. But the government has grown increasingly frustrated. After all, not only is growth slowing, but the RBI has refused to reduce interest rates even as the inflation rate has fallen to historic lows.

Some argue that the MPC is simply ignoring or misreading the evidence. Even the RBI had to admit that its inflation forecast for the first quarter was off by an unusually large 1.4

<|begin_of_text|>The latest data on the Chinese economy released on Saturday show exports down 8% year-on-year. By any measure you pick, China’s expansion is losing steam.

But working out how much it’s slowing by is extremely hard to do.

Based on a series of different indicators, the economy is currently growing between about 4% and 7% a year. That’s not exactly a small gap, and the truth matters enormously for China, Asia and the rest of the world. The country has a ballooning debt issue that will be much harder to deal with if growth is slow.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch global economist Gustavo Reis and his team sent out a note over the weekend discussing just how much Chinese growth is slowing by a series of different measures.

One of the measures they have looked at is an analyst favourite: The Li Keqiang Index (LKI). Back in 2007, Li reportedly told a US ambassador that he personally looked at the economy with an index made up of three parts: Electricity production, rail traffic, and lending.

Here’s how those three look:

Loans are rising, but electricity production is up by less than 5% year-on-year, and rail traffic is shrinking at rates last seen during the depths of the 2008-09 financial crisis.

So it’s fair to say that it’s not a pretty picture as far as China’s Premier’s favourite economic index is concerned. Here’s how it looks in comparison to GDP:

The BAI (broad activity index) brought together by BAML economists tracks GDP much more closely — it’s a composite of 20 different indicators.

But yet another indicator, the LEAP index, which brings together “power output, crude steel output, cement output, auto sales, housing starts, railway cargo traffic and medium- to long-term loans,” suggests Chinese GDP is even more overblown than the Li Keqiang Index does.

So it’s something of a mystery.

There seem to be at least three possibilities:

The government is lying. This doesn’t seem difficult to imagine. The credibility of the Chinese government is attached to both its ability to provide growth and its ability to exert a high level of control over the economy. Slower growth isn’t something it would like to admit.

Consumer-price inflation may currently be modest, but another sort of inflation, in share prices, is rampant. Many central bankers are privately worried about the lofty heights share prices have reached, but they do not believe there is much they can or should do about it. Such diffidence could prove damaging. Price stability, remember, is only a means to the end of maximum sustainable growth. And asset-price inflation can be even more harmful to growth than ordinary inflation.

Policymakers often claim that by pursuing price stability they will reduce the risk of boom and bust. But history suggests that, although price stability does deliver big benefits, it does not guarantee economic and financial stability. Indeed, there is reason to believe that financial bubbles may be more likely to develop during periods of low CPI inflation. The two biggest bubbles this century—America's in the 1920s and Japan's in the 1980s—both developed when inflation was modest.

One explanation is that when inflation is subdued, interest rates look low, thanks to “money illusion”: people fail to notice that in real terms rates are just as high as in more inflationary times. This encourages a borrowing binge and prompts investors to chase higher and hence riskier returns. When interest rates are low, people are also able to borrow a much bigger multiple of their incomes to finance speculative investment. At the same time, price stability can sometimes encourage economic euphoria. With seemingly no reason for central banks to raise interest rates, people start to expect that the expansion will continue indefinitely. This false sense of security encourages investors to take bigger risks, and lenders to relax their standards.

Flemming Larsen, the deputy director of research at the IMF, pointed out in a recent speech that there was much evidence that an economy can overheat even at a time of price stability as conventionally defined. Excess demand shows up instead in balance sheets and asset prices. Traditional indicators of

University life. (Photo: M. Spencer Green, AP) Story Highlights Administrative bloat at American colleges and universities is out of hand.

One calculation shows college tuition increased from 1978 to 2011 at an annual rate of 7.45%.

Now colleges and universities are actually facing declining enrollments, and even credit downgrades.

"Why am I paying so much tuition to people whose job seems to be telling me to call someone else?"

That was my daughter's lament last week as she tried to pry an essential form out of her college's labyrinthine bureaucracy, but it's a question that many Americans should be asking. Administrative bloat at American colleges and universities is out of hand, and it's probably the biggest cause of the skyrocketing tuitions that afflict students and parents today.

Everyone knows that tuitions have skyrocketed, though many may not appreciate the full extent of the problem. As University of Michigan economics and finance professor Mark Perry has calculated, college tuition increased from 1978 to 2011 at an annual rate of 7.45%. That far outpaced health-care costs, which increased by 5.8%, and housing, which, notwithstanding the bubble, increased at 4.3%. Family incomes, on the other hand, barely kept up with the Consumer Price Index, which grew at an annual rate of 3.8%.

That has led many students (and sometimes their co-signing parents) into a nightmare of debt, as student loans have been used to fill the gap. Now colleges and universities are actually facing declining enrollments, and in some cases even credit downgrades as their ability to endlessly raise tuition comes into question. But why has tuition risen so fast?

Some commentators blame lazy, overpaid faculty. But while faculty teaching loads are somewhat lower than they were decades ago, faculty-student ratios have been quite stable over the past several decades, while the ratio of administrators and staff to students has become much less favorable. In his book on administrative bloat, The Fall Of The Faculty, Johns Hopkins professor Benjamin Ginsberg reports that although student-faculty ratios fell slightly between 1975 and 2005, from 16-to-1 to 15-to-1, the student-to-administrator ratio fell from 84-to-1 to 68-to-1, and the student-to-professional-staff ratio fell from 50-to-1 to 21-to-1.

(Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures fell on Wednesday as Chinese stocks had another roller coaster ride and as investors await the minutes from last month's Federal Reserve meeting for clues on when interest rates will be increased.

* While the health of the U.S. economy appears to be stabilizing, the effect of the yuan devaluation and other macro factors are playing on investor's minds. The Fed minutes will be released at 2 p.m. ET.

* Economists believe the Fed will probably raise rates twice this year, with the first hike coming in September. Investors are still not fully convinced of a September hike, but most are betting a rate hike will occur by the end of year.

* Chinese stocks reversed sharp declines and ended higher after the central bank injected more funds into the financial system for a second day in a bid to calm panicky markets.

* The People's Bank of China devalued the yuan last week, triggering an avalanche of selling by investors globally who feared Beijing wanted to engineer a much sharper decline to support weak exports.

* The Chinese market gyrations kept commodity prices under pressure, with oil and copper near six-year lows.

* Other data due Wednesday is expected to show consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in July, less than the 0.3 percent rise in June. The Consumer Price Index data is due at 8:30 a.m. ET.

* Lowe's shares fell 1.6 percent to $71.85 in premarket trading after the No.2 U.S. home improvement chain's quarterly profit missed expectations.

* Yum Brands rose 1.5 percent to $85.50, a day after the owner of the KFC and Pizza Hut chains announced new leadership for its China division as activist investors lobby the company to spin off that business.

* Staples fell 1.6 percent to $13.93 after the office supplies retailer reported quarterly revenue slightly below analysts' estimates, hurt by a stronger dollar.

Futures snapshot at 7:07 a.m. ET:

* S&P 500 e-minis were down 5.25 points, or 0.25 percent, with 143,877 contracts traded.

<|begin_of_text|>(Updates with link to most and least expensive cities to live in the U.S.)

For the first time, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis released price-adjusted estimates of personal income for states and metropolitan areas for 2008 to 2012, and it shows that, at the very least, it’s more expensive for Members of Congress to live in the nation’s capital on their $174,000 salary than in any state from which they hail.

The results show the District of Columbia, in 2012, had the highest “regional price parity” of any state. Granted, D.C.’s really a city, not a state, and set against their more natural comparisons, it ranks fifth, behind the Urban Honolulu area, New York-Newark-Jersey City, San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk and San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward. Beaches, hedge funds and technology are the key to prices, evidently.

The cheapest metro areas, by this methodology, were Danville, Ill.; Jefferson City, Mo.; Jackson, Tenn.; Jonesboro, Ark.; and Rome, Ga.

See related look at most and least expensive cities to live in the U.S.

Put another way,it costs 54% more to live in Honolulu than in Danville.

The top five states (outside of D.C.) were Hawaii, New York, New Jersey, California and Maryland, and the bottom five states were Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Missouri and South Dakota. So, it costs 36% more to live in Hawaii than in Mississippi.

The BEA says it produced the report in large part so people and businesses can have a better understanding how their personal income may be impacted by a job change or move. There is regional consumer price index data, but those statistics aren’t designed for regional or city comparisons, whereas this data is, a spokesman says.

The Fond du Lac County Finance Committee is considering a proposal that would provide a workaround of the restrictions of the controversial collective bargaining law Act 10 for members of a public employees union.

County Human Resources Director Michael Marx sent a memorandum to the county's Finance Committee in May explaining the limitations the law placed on the AFSCME local 1366E Social Services union.

Act 10 removed the ability of public employees unions to negotiate for anything but a pay increase limited to the Consumer Price Index. The county board approved a 1.57-percent increase for the union's members, which is the maximum allowed under the law this year.

Other non-union county employees received a 2-percent increase without similar restrictions at the beginning of the year.

"In other words, this group is being penalized by the state because they didn't decertify their union," Board Chairman Martin Farrell said.

Marx recommended the board approve a supplemental pay increase for the more than 70 employees affected to make up for the difference. The extra pay would work like a bonus, being paid once in a lump sum in the first pay period of December.

The extra pay would also be based on the number of hours worked, ranging from 7 to 10 cents, depending on the employee's current wages, and would be increased by 1.5 times for overtime. Marx said the payments would amount to between $140 to $190, depending on the employee's wages.

Next year's supplemental pay would have to be reapproved by the board, and every year after, and can't be a part of the union's next contract negotiations. That's because the supplemental pay can't be part of the union's contact under Act 10 and is entirely at the discretion of the board, Marx said.

"This is just the least problematic way of getting the increase to the employees without creating extra coding in our system," County Executive Al Buechel said. "When you look at personnel administration

<|begin_of_text|>TOKYO (Reuters) - Nearly two-thirds of Japanese companies do not plan to hike their workers’ wages this year, a Reuters poll showed, a blow to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s campaign for higher pay to spur a recovery and a way to end two decades of deflation.

People walk past an electronic board showing stock prices outside a brokerage at a business district in Tokyo, Japan, January 4, 2017. Picture taken on January 4, 2017. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon

The Reuters Corporate Survey, conducted Jan. 4-17, also found that most wage gains over the past four years since Abe came to power have been minimal and that nearly one-quarter of firms have implemented none at all.

In each of those four years, just before labor and management kick off their annual “shunto” talks - which set the tone for broader wages - Abe has urged companies to raise wages to boost households’ purchasing power and stimulate spending.

But Japan Inc has generally resisted Abe’s plea. Although the yen has weakened recently, many companies were hurt badly by last year’s spike in the currency and are loath to commit to higher wages in the face of uncertainty amid threats about trade barriers by new U.S. President Donald Trump.

“Manufacturers’ profits may expand this year given the current yen weakening, but that could change depending on what Trump says and does,” said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute, who reviewed the survey results.

As such, companies appear to opt to reward employees with one-off bonus payments after profits are secured, rather than promising a base pay raise.

“Without base pay rise, wage growth is unlikely to accelerate. On the other hand, prices may increase as oil prices rebound, which will curb (inflation-adjusted) real wages and hurt households’ purchasing power,” Tokuda said.

The monthly poll of 531 big and mid-size firms, in which about 240 responded, found 63 percent said they were not planning a base pay hike.

In Japan, an increase is pivotal for sustainable wage growth as the base salary accounts for the bulk of monthly wages. Base pay rises had been virtually frozen for over a decade since the early 2000s, until Abe swept to power in late 2012 with a pledge to reboot the moribund economy.

<|begin_of_text|>For five months, the Luas strike was seemingly intractable, incapable of solution, before a change of heart by one shop steward broke the log-jam late last week.

However, if the Luas settlement came suddenly in the end, its effect will live long, as other transport workers set the 18 per cent increase over 4½ years as the starting point for their own demands.

In a fortnight’s time the Labour Court will hear claims from Dublin Bus workers who want rises of 20-30 per cent over a number of years.

The impact of the Luas dispute on the industrial relations landscape is hard to overstate, since it has ratcheted up expectations, altered mindsets and created new ideas of what is possible. It has also shown that a hard-fought campaign of disruptive industrial action, in the face of largely hostile media and public opinion, can win rises over and above recent norms.

The initial 54 per cent pay claim seemed excessive. However, management’s opening position was a deal linked to the Consumer Price Index – one that could be close to zero.

Supported

The Labour Court recommendation is considered by unions to have a set an important precedent. Unions such as the NBRU have already signalled they want pay parity between bus and tram drivers. In the absence of any centralised pay bargaining after the collapse of social partnership, prior to the Luas deal, a number of key unions such as Siptu and Mandate have concluded 2-3 per cent deals for the private sector. A survey of private sector employers published by specialist journal Industrial Relations News last March forecast pay deals this year would be an average of 2.2 per cent.

Under the deal, Luas drivers will receive increases of about 18 per cent phased over 55 months to late 2020 – far more than the company had wanted, but less than they could have received if they had accepted an earlier offer.

Ahead of trends

Some, though, contend that if the deal is extended back to October 2014, when the previous agreement expired, then the new increases fall within the 2-3 per cent pay norms.

However, this argument is unlikely to hold much sway. Last month, Dublin Bus unions rejected a proposal in talks at the Workplace Relations Commission for increases of 8 per cent over four years for its 3,400 staff.

Siptu is likely to argue to the Labour Court on June 30th that it can accept nothing less than the 18 per cent proposed

China’s Central Bank Continues to Shake Up the Bitcoin Market

Over the past few weeks, Bitcoin spectators have been closely watching Chinese exchanges make significant changes. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has been inspecting the country’s Bitcoin exchanges looking for issues with regulatory compliance such as money laundering. So far the top three exchange platforms have ceased margin lending practices and have also added fees to every Bitcoin trade.

Now, this week the PBOC has visited with smaller exchanges within the region including Chbtc, Haobtc, Btctrade, Yunbi, BTC100, Dahonghuo, Jubi, Bitbay, and Yuanbao. The initial visits had caused the price to drop a touch but quickly rose back to the $1070 range on February 8. The following day on February 9 the exchanges Okcoin and Huobi announced they would suspend BTC and LTC withdrawals for one month which subsequently caused the Bitcoin price to drop 10 percent.

Both companies have stated their exchanges will be “upgrading” in order to comply with “anti-money laundering efforts, foreign exchange management and other financial laws and regulations.” The pausing of withdrawals and the upgrades are expected to last one month but “may also be substantially ahead of the development process,” says Huobi’s announcement. This “in order to avoid possible illegal transactions that may continue before the system upgrade is complete,” Huobi’s announcement concludes.

Inflation is expected to end 2015 at 6.99 percent, up from 6.67 percent in the prior week's survey and 6.53 percent a month ago, according to the median forecast of about 100 market economists.

<|begin_of_text|>To see how it works, consider a topic I know well: the recent history of inflation scares.

More than five years have passed since many conservatives started warning that the Federal Reserve, by taking action to contain the financial crisis and boost the economy, was setting the stage for runaway inflation. And, to be fair, that wasn’t a crazy position to take in 2009; I could have told you it was wrong (and, in fact, I did), but you could see where it was coming from.

Over time, however, as the promised inflation kept failing to arrive, there should have come a point when the inflationistas conceded their error and moved on.

In fact, however, few did. Instead, they mostly doubled down on their predictions of doom, and some moved on to conspiracy theorizing, claiming that high inflation was already happening, but was being concealed by government officials.

Why the bad behavior? Nobody likes admitting to mistakes, and all of us — even those of us who try not to — sometimes engage in motivated reasoning, selectively citing facts to support our preconceptions.

But hard as it is to admit one’s own errors, it’s much harder to admit that your entire political movement got it badly wrong. Inflation phobia has always been closely bound up with right-wing politics; to admit that this phobia was misguided would have meant conceding that one whole side of the political divide was fundamentally off base about how the economy works. So most of the inflationistas have responded to the failure of their prediction by becoming more, not less, extreme in their dogma, which will make it even harder for them ever to admit that they, and the political movement they serve, have been wrong all along.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

“France is rotten,” said a friend yesterday. “I don’t know why you came back. Half the people are broke. The other half are crazy…

“…and you foreigners still come here, pay $1 million for a hole-in-the-wall apartment…and walk around the city and step in dogsh*t.”

Yes, dear reader, that is a fair description of France circa 2012. The new president, Francois Hollande, says he won’t wait for the private sector to create jobs. He will do it himself. He’ll hire more teachers. Never mind that the payback on educational spending is zero — or less. It sounds good to the lumpen-voters.

And how will he pay for these new teachers? This week, he is expected to raise taxes on the rich. The top marginal rate, he says, will go up to 75%. And the wealth tax will go up too.

In short, the elites who control France will soon control, directly, more of it…and more of the rich will move to Switzerland, England or Belgium.

Rotten…rotten…rotten…

But here at The Daily Reckoning, we like rotten countries. For example, in a state of even more advanced decay, there is Argentina, where president Cristina Fernando de Kirchner has just announced a solution to the housing problem.

We pause to give dear readers a quick résumé of how housing got to be a problem south of the Rio Plata. In the ’80s, the generals who ran Argentina tried to pay their bills by printing money. This led to consumer price increases of more than 1,000% per year. They had to throw out one currency, start a new one, and then throw that one out too. And then there was the war with England. Eventually, people got sick of it and threw the generals out. Then, President Carlos Menem promised a “hard” currency for Argentina, which he would achieve by tying the peso directly to the dollar.

No one is more persuasive than an Argentine when he is trying to borrow money. And since the currency risk was eliminated — or so investors thought — the Argentines soon were able to borrow more money than they could possibly repay, which led to the biggest default — about $100 billion — in world history.

The official inflation rate is now still in single digits. But the actual inflation rate — which is apparently illegal to report — is near 25%. This —

<|begin_of_text|>Despite several quarters of rising GDP, and the upbeat exertions of Administration spokespeople, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has yet to announce the recession is over. Their reluctance is well-founded. It is beginning to dawn on even the more optimistic analysts that the tepid growth we have seen over the past three quarters is only an interlude in an otherwise grave and prolonged recession. Moreover, the respite will cost dearly as the United States has racked up a generation worth of debt for dubious benefit.

The paltry number of new jobs currently being created still fall far short of the 375,000 per month needed to offset the 125,000 new entrants to the job market due to population growth and to erode the 8 million people laid off in the past year alone. Meanwhile, house prices continue to fall and credit continues to contract. With retail sales dropping in June and the Leading Economic Index (LEI) standing at minus 7.7 per cent, it should be clear that the US economy is heading back towards recession, following a temporary distortion created by some $1.3 trillion in federal stimulus. In short, the stimulus has failed.

While there can be no doubt that an increase in government spending will result in a boost to GDP figures, the evidence of history shows that such growth is short-lived. Unfortunately as leaders around the world look to tighten the reins on out of control spending, President Obama and his Democratic supporters in Congress believe that their stimulus actions have succeeded and should be redoubled. Armed with nothing more than faith in government and a belief that spending is both a means and an end, it appears that the US stimulus policy will continue. The net result of these efforts will not be a more vibrant economy, but the perpetuation of fear and confusion in the business community and the continuing expansion of deficits that will lead inevitably to higher taxes.

The more indebted an economy becomes, the greater the burden that must be borne by the wealth-creating private sector. Indeed, at the present rate of government debt-financing, the private sector will have to contribute some $2 trillion each year in interest costs alone. This money must be raised by taxation or inflation.

This week, in response to their fears of increased regulations, higher taxes, and greater government stewardship of the economy, discontent among business leaders flared into the open. Gathering in Washington, leaders of the US Chamber of Commerce lashed out at current regulatory changes in healthcare.

Press Release: March PCI Increase Indicates U.S. Economy on 4 Percent Growth Track

Ceridian-UCLA Pulse of Commerce Index™ (PCI) by UCLA Anderson School of Management staged a healthy comeback in March, with the PCI growing by 1 percent, making up for February’s snowstorm-induced decline of 0.7 percent. The adjusted index grew from 107.4 to 108.5, continuing its climb from a recessionary low of 100.7 in June 2009.... [T]he March PCI shows growth over the prior year period for the fourth consecutive month. This follows twenty-two consecutive months of year-over-year declines experienced prior to December 2009.

...

“The good news in March is that the economy is still recovering at a pace that should support job growth, although unfortunately not at a pace that will drive rapid improvement in the unemployment rate. GDP needs to grow at a 5 to 6 percent rate to drive meaningful change in unemployment,” said Ed Leamer, chief economist for the PCI.

For the first quarter of 2010, the PCI grew at an annualized rate of 9.7 percent, a solid gain but not enough to offset the declines of 14 percent and 16 percent suffered in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. “In other words, we fell into the recession much more rapidly than we are climbing out of it,” Leamer said.

<|begin_of_text|>Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan dashed expectations of the government, consumers and business leaders as he kept lending rates unchanged on Tuesday despite plunging inflation and mounting pressure to ease borrowing costs to aid a revival.

Unchanged interest rates would imply your home loan EMIs, which eat away large chunks of household incomes, are unlikely to fall anytime soon.

High loan rates could influence people’s decision to buy houses, cars and other consumer goods, mostly bought through loans.

The benchmark lending rate has remained unchanged since January last year, demonstrating the RBI governor’s unwavering commitment to keep inflation firmly bottled up for longer period of time, before softening of the rather hawkish stance.

Budding revival signs in the broader economy and falling inflation rates had rekindled hopes that the RBI would lower loan rates to assist companies’ investment plans, critical to spin jobs and multiply income.

Rajan retained the repo rate -- the rate at which banks borrow from RBI -- at 8%, and kept the cash reserve ratio (CRR)-- the proportion of deposits banks to have to park with the central bank -- at 4%, in the bi-month monetary policy review.

Retail inflation eased in to a three-year low of 5.52% in October, below the central bank's target of 6% by 2016.

India’s wholesale inflation rate -- the main gauge to capture country-wide price movements -- has also plunged to a five-year low of 1.77% in October, triggering a chorus of demand for lower borrowing costs to boost investment and consumer spending.

The next monetary policy is scheduled for February 3, 2015, but Rajan did not rule out a rate revision outside of the policy calendar depending on future price movements.

“A change in the monetary policy stance at the current juncture is premature. However, if the current inflation momentum and changes in inflationary expectations continue, and fiscal developments are encouraging, a change in the monetary policy stance is likely early next year, including outside the policy review cycle,” Rajan said.

Analysts said the RBI governor could wait for cues to come from the next year’s Union budget in February before initiating any rate action.

Industry leaders have been ratcheting up their demand for cheaper loans with the government also hoping that the central bank would signal a reversal of its prolonged hawkish stance that some see as affecting capacity expansion plans.

According to experts low and stable interest rates are critical to fast-track roads, ports, airports, and railways projects to create

Creative packaging that includes smaller quantities but offers the same price helps delude many Americans into thinking their dollar still has the purchasing power of better days. This all occurs in a relatively subtle and typically hidden process. Cotton for example is now up 90 percent for the year. Corn is up over 40 percent. It would be one thing if this was all based purely on demand but more of this increase in price is coming from the Federal Reserve pursuing actions that are punishing the U.S. Dollar. The below chart is rather startling and shows that even though the CPI has remained weak, principally because of the crashing housing market, many other areas are seeing incredible price increases.

The S&P 500 is up a good 9 percent for the year but that pales in comparison to other sectors:

Notice that orange juice is now more expensive? Probably because it is up 20 percent for the year. We also need to remember that the working and middle class feel much poorer because even if wages remain stagnant, the cost of daily goods and items has steadily increased. Part of this doesn’t show up in the CPI because of the large dominance of “owner’s equivalent of rent” which has held the index lower for a good time now. But even oil is reflecting the weakness of the dollar:

Clearly gas prices are not going down. The dollar weakness is already showing up in crude prices because people are having less faith in the dollar especially when the Federal Reserve can go off and print money on whatever whim they desire. Did Congress have any thorough vote regarding quantitative easing? It just seems that the Fed can ram down whatever policy it likes and condemn the middle class in the U.S. to a currency that is weaker and weaker. The Fed and the U.S. Treasury won’t openly say this but what they are doing is exporting the U.S. middle class around the globe and lowering the standard of living for most Americans because of their goal of maintaining the current monetary and banking system in place.

Everyone knows about inflation - a pervasive, unstoppable force that moves prices (and hopefully wages) upward in the economy, but do we really understand it? Further analysis reveals that official overall inflation statistics understate the effect of rising prices on the poor.

Understanding Inflation

Inflation is measured through changes in what is called the Consumer Price Index or CPI. This is an aggregate measure of prices based on a certain ‘basket’ of goods composed of those typically consumed by households. It seems like a fair enough way to measure general price increases, but it has the effect of making you think that inflation affects everyone equally - it does not.

The basket of goods is an approximation of the average proportions that households consume. It turns out, however, that there are significant differences in the basket of goods for households from different income levels:

Lower income classes tend to spend more of their income on Food & Beverage, and this proportion drops as we move up the income scale. This is because the absolute level of food consumed in the household is limited, and extra income is allocated to certain ‘luxuries’ and other necessities, evidenced by the fact that higher income households spend more of their income on the other, non-food categories.

Just as a validity check: the data that we generated from the FIES raw data closely approximates the official NSO weighting, except for food and housing. I suspect that imputed rental value was used by the NSO instead of actual rentals paid, but since there was no breakdown in the CPI Technical Notes, I can’t say for sure. Nevertheless, it is the variance in the effect, not the absolute effect, that we are interested in.

So what does this mean? Different income classes will experience different inflation burdens because the prices of goods and services that they consume rise at different rates:

Since the base year 2006, essentials such as food and beverage and education have risen much more than the overall inflation rate. This means that poorer households that spend more of their income on food and beverage will feel a stronger pinch from price increases. Non-essential goods’ prices have risen slower than inflation except for Alcohol & Tobacco which were

They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.

If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.

Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Sterling climbed to its highest level against the euro in almost two years on Monday as concerns grew in the financial markets about the deepening crisis in the single currency.

A pound at one stage bought more than €1.23 on the foreign exchanges – making foreign holidays cheaper but UK exports to the single-currency zone more expensive.

Fears that "austerity fatigue" is setting in among voters were heightened after figures were released showing that Spain – the country thought to be next in line for a bailout – has slid back into recession.

The pound was also stronger against the US dollar, where last week's weaker-than-expected growth figures for the first three months of 2012 were followed by a closely watched barometer of business in Chicago. Although figures last week showed the UK economy suffering from a double-dip recession, dealers are now anxious that the recovery in the world's biggest economy is losing momentum.

City analysts said the rise in the value of the pound was not a vote of confidence in the UK but rather a vote of no confidence in the eurozone, where growth prospects are deemed to be worse than they are in Britain. Speculation that the Bank of England will be reluctant to expand its £325bn quantitative easing programme has also underpinned the pound over the past month, a period when pressure has mounted on bond markets in Spain and Italy.

Valentin Marinov, currency analyst with CitiFX in New York, said the next few days could be crucial for the pound because the monthly Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) surveys starting on Tuesday of manufacturing, construction and services would be closely watched for evidence that last week's figures showing a 0.2% drop in gross domestic product in the first three months of the year gave a false picture of the true state of the economy.

"The reason for that is the fact that investors largely ignored the very disappointing quarter one GDP data released last week on the grounds that the PMIs were largely upbeat. Indications that the sentiment indicators declined more than expected in April could undermine to a degree market confidence that the UK growth figures will be revised significantly to the upside in coming weeks. In turn, renewed growth concerns could erode some of the interest rate advantage of sterling ahead of the regular Bank of England meeting and the release of the Bank's inflation report in the next couple of weeks."

Dealers are looking to see whether the pound can break through €1

<|begin_of_text|>Should we expect prices to fall all the way back? Well, in the late 1980s, Los Angeles experienced a large localized housing bubble: real home prices rose about 50 percent before the bubble popped. Home prices then proceeded to fall by a quarter, which combined with ongoing inflation brought real housing prices right back to their prebubble level.

And here’s the thing: this process took more than five years — L.A. home prices didn’t bottom out until the mid-1990s. If the current housing slump runs on the same schedule, we won’t be seeing a recovery until 2011 or later.

What about the broader economy? You might be tempted to take comfort from the fact that the last two recessions, in 1990-1991 and 2001, were both quite short. But in each case, the official end of the recession was followed by a long period of sluggish economic growth and rising unemployment that felt to most Americans like a continued recession.

Photo

Thus, the 1990 recession officially ended in March 1991, but unemployment kept rising through much of 1992, allowing Bill Clinton to win the election on the basis of the economy, stupid. The next recession officially began in March 2001 and ended in November, but unemployment kept rising until June 2003.

These prolonged recession-like episodes probably reflect the changing nature of the business cycle. Earlier recessions were more or less deliberately engineered by the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates to control inflation. Modern slumps, by contrast, have been hangovers from bouts of irrational exuberance — the savings and loan free-for-all of the 1980s, the technology bubble of the 1990s and now the housing bubble.

Ending those old-fashioned recessions was easy because all the Fed had to do was relent. Ending modern slumps is much more difficult because the economy needs to find something to replace the burst bubble.

<|begin_of_text|>Senate Democrats on Friday told President Obama they don’t want to see cuts to Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid in his annual budget.

Sixteen senators wrote to the president as fears persist among liberals that Obama will once again offer some entitlement cuts in his budget, which is set to be released March 4.

In last April’s budget, Obama proposed changing the way the government calculates inflation. The change to the chained consumer price index (CPI) would have reduced retirement benefits as well as increasing some taxes.

Obama also proposed increasing means testing for outpatient and drug benefits under Medicare.

In total, the budget had $1 trillion in spending cuts the administration touted as a sign of Obama’s seriousness on the deficit.

The Senate Democrats are warning that cuts to Social Security do not jive with the president’s focus on income inequality. The issue of entitlement spending is a highly charged one this election year, and many Democrats are trying to paint themselves as the party with compassion.

“Mr. President: These are tough times for our country. With the middle class struggling and more people living in poverty than ever before, we urge you not to propose cuts in your budget to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid benefits – cuts which would make life even more difficult for some of the most vulnerable people in America,” the senators said.

“Social Security has not contributed one penny to the deficit,,” the letter goes on to state. “We are also opposed to shifting the cost of healthcare onto senior citizens, the poor, and the disabled by cutting Medicare and Medicaid benefits.”

Sanders said in an interview that, given the fact the annual budget deficit has been cut in half, Obama's focus has to shift to helping the middle class and poor.

"The focus of attention right now has got to be on the collapsing middle class," Sanders said. "What we need from the president now is a reassurance that he is not going to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid."

On Friday, White House press secretary Jay Carney was asked at the daily briefing whether chained CPI will be in the budget, and he declined to say.

"What I can tell you is the president has demonstrated in the past and continues — and will continue to demonstrate his commitment to achieving additional deficit reduction that addresses our medium- and long-term challenges through a balanced approach," he said.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>U.S. may face deflation, a problem Japan understands too well

Economists worry that America could be edging closer to the trap that cost the other nation more than a decade of growth.

But soon, lower prices cut into business profits, and managers begin to trim payrolls. That in turn undermines consumers' buying power, leading to more pressure on profits, jobs and wages — as well as cutbacks in expansion and in the purchase of new plants and equipment.

When deflation begins, prices fall. At first that seems like a good thing.

And as Tokyo's experience suggests, deflation can be at least as tough a problem as the soaring prices of inflation or the financial pain of a traditional recession.

But increasingly, economists and other analysts are expressing concern that the United States could be edging closer to a different problem — the kind of deflationary trap that cost Japan more than a decade of growth and economic progress.

Reporting from Washington — The White House prediction Friday that the deficit would hit a record $1.47 trillion this year poured new fuel on the fiery argument over whether the government should begin cutting back to avoid future inflation or instead keep stimulating the economy to help the still-sputtering recovery.

Also, consumers who are financially able to buy often wait for still lower prices, adding to the deflationary trend.

All these factors feed on one another, setting off a downward spiral that can be as hard to escape from as a stall in an airplane.

For now, the dominant theme of the nation's economic policy debate remains centered on the comparative dangers of deficits and inflation. However, economists across the political spectrum — here and abroad — are talking more often about the potential for deflation.

So how likely is the problem?

The latest U.S. data are sobering: Consumer prices overall have declined in each of the last three months, putting the inflation index in June just 1.1% above a year earlier. The core inflation rate — a better gauge of where prices are going because it excludes volatile energy and food items — has dropped to a 44-year low of 0.9%.

That's well below the 1.5%-to-2% year-over-year inflation that the Federal Reserve likes to see, and some Fed policymakers have raised concerns about the rising risk of a broad decline in prices.

Private economists and financial experts have expressed much greater concern.

"I think we have to take it seriously," said John Mauldin, president of Millennium Wave Advisors in Dallas, who puts the probability of def

India's economic growth rate picked up strongly in the most recent quarter, according to official figures.

The economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.8% in the July-to-September period, up from 4.4% in the previous quarter.

The acceleration was faster than analysts had been expecting.

Asia's third-largest economy has been weighed down by various factors, such as high inflation, a weak currency and a drop in foreign investment.

This is the fourth quarter in a row that India's annual growth rate has been below the 5% mark, and the previous quarter's rate of 4.4% was the lowest for four years.

Earlier this year, the Indian prime minister's economic advisory council lowered the growth outlook for the current financial year.

It now expects the economy to expand by 5.3% this year, down from its earlier projection of 6.4%.

Growth hurdles

India's economy has been hurt by a range of factors in recent months, including a slowdown in key sectors such as mining and manufacturing.

Slowing growth, coupled with a recovery in developed markets, such as the US, has made India a less attractive option for foreign investors.

Speculation that the US may scale back its key economic stimulus measure has seen investors pull money out of emerging markets, such as India.

This has affected India's currency, which dipped nearly 25% against the US dollar between January and September this year.

Though the rupee has recovered a little since then, it is still down about 13% against the dollar since the start of this year.

That has made imports more expensive and contributed to a high rate of consumer inflation, which was 10.1% October, up from 9.84% in September.

High food and fuel prices have contributed to inflation becoming "entrenched", finance minister P Chidambaram said.

As a result, the central bank has had to raise the cost of borrowing in a bid to curb inflation.

The latest interest rate rise in October saw the key rate increase to 7.75%.

Some observers argue that high interest rates are hurting businesses and households, and having a negative impact on the economy.

"A combination of weak investment, high inflation and tight monetary policy would not let India's economic recovery gather steam any time soon," Miguel Chanco, Asia economist at Capital Economics, told the BBC.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

This data is based on the 2017 edition of the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report that features the latest iteration of the Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI). The TTCI benchmarks the travel and tourism competitiveness of 136 economies. The TTCI measures “the set of factors and policies that enable the sustainable development of the Travel & Tourism (T&T) sector, which in turn, contributes to the development and competitiveness of a country”. It comprises four sub-indexes, 14 pillars, and 90 individual indicators, distributed among the different pillars.

India’s ranking in the TTCI of World Economic Forum moved from 65th position to 52nd position in 2015. This year, India has moved up by another 12 positions and ranked at the 40th position. In the last three years, India has cumulatively improved its ranking by 25 places, which is a significant achievement.

Spain tops the 2017 edition of the TTCI global rankings for the second time, followed by France (2nd), Germany (3rd), Japan (4th, gaining five places), the United Kingdom (5th), the United States (6th, losing two places), Australia (7th), Italy (8th), Canada (9th, up one) and Switzerland (10th, losing four places).

Dr Mahesh Sharma, Minister of State (I/C) for Tourism and Culture acknowledged the vision, guidance and support of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the tourism sector of the country that is the driving force and motivation for everyone to continuously work for the growth of Tourism in India.

India continues to allure international tourists with its vast cultural and natural resources with a ranking of 9th and 24th respectively. In terms of price competitiveness advantage, India is ranked 10th.

India continues to enhance its cultural resources, protecting more cultural sites and intangible expressions through UNESCO World Heritage lists, and they also increasing their digital presence.

India is ranked 55th, up by 14 places in terms of international openness, which has been possible through stronger visa policies. Implementing both visa-on-arrival and e-visa has enabled India to rise through the ranks.

Approximately 5–15% of the fuel consumed by a typical car may be used to overcome rolling resistance.[1] A 2003 California Energy Commission (CEC) preliminary study estimated that adoption of low-rolling resistance tires could save 1.5–4.5% of all gasoline consumption, but that current data were also insufficient to compare safety and other characteristics.[2]

A United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) study in 2009 found that if 2% of the replacement tires would reduce their rolling resistance by 5%, there would be 7.9 million gallons fuel and 76,000 metric tons of CO2 saved annually.

(SAE J1269 and SAE J2452) performed on new tires.

Measuring rolling resistance in tires [ edit ]

Rolling resistance can be expressed by the rolling resistance coefficient (RRC or C rr ), which is the value of the rolling resistance force divided by the wheel load. A lower coefficient means the tires will use less energy to travel a certain distance. The coefficient is mostly considered as independent of speed, but for precise calculations it is tabled at several speeds or an additional speed-dependent part is used. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has developed test practices to measure the RRC of tires. These tests (SAE J1269 and SAE J2452) are usually performed on new tires.

When measured by using these standard test practices, most new passenger tires have reported RRCs ranging from 0.007 to 0.014.[3] In the case of bicycle tires, values of 0.0025 to 0.005 are achieved.[4] These coefficients are measured on rollers, with power meters on road surfaces, or with coast-down tests. In the latter two cases, the effect of air resistance must be subtracted or the tests performed at very low speeds. In 2009 The CEC used a rating called Rolling Resistance Force RRF. RRF and RRC, rolling resistance coefficient are very similar. Difference is taking the RRF and dividing it by the load(weight) to get RRC. So a Michelin Harmony tire rated at 9.45 RRF at 1000 pounds load would be.0095 RRC.[5][6]

The Nielsen Consumer Confidence Index dropped by seven points in the first quarter of 2015 to 72 points, as the recession in Russia and high consumer-price inflation have undermined optimism over the future.

To put that number in perspective, in the first quarter of 2009 with the global financial system in free fall after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the index never fell below 75.

Even during the worst of the Great Recession, only 4.7% of Russians surveyed said they had enough money only for the basics. The current figure is more than three times as high as that level.

And the rest of the statistics for the Russian domestic economy make for equally grim reading.

According to Rosstat, the country's official statistics bureau, real disposable incomes fell for a fifth consecutive month in March, contracting at an annual rate of 1.8%. That follows falls of 1.6% in February and 0.8% over 2014 as a whole.

Vladimir Putin attends the World Health Organization meeting on healthy lifestyle in Moscow, April 28, 2011. Reuters The figures illustrate starkly on whom the burden of Russia's recent downturn has really fallen. While the country's banks and state-owned enterprises have been the recipients of billions of dollars of bailout cash, the country's citizens have had to take on the burden of runaway inflation (now around 17%), shortages of Western food imports, and a stagnating domestic economy.

According to the Russian business news site RBC, 55% of Russians are now being forced to save for clothes, with 48% saying they are reducing the money they plan to spend on vacations.

The Russian central bank has repeatedly stressed the importance of focusing on the weakness of the domestic economy over recent months. It has pointed to weak labour productivity, low levels of investment, and declining consumer demand as causes for concern.

The question now is whether the Kremlin has the desire or the ability to address the situation. After all, the fall in the oil price might be temporary, but the belief of its citizens in their future prosperity is what Russia desperately needs if it is to succeed in diversifying its economy away from commodity exports.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

According to a report from Buzzfeed, Apple objected to the idea of introducing a second gun emoji on its platforms, and Microsoft joined in. The decision to remove the rifle emoji, as well as a second "pentathlon" emoji depicting a man holding a pistol among other athletes, was apparently unanimous.

“Nobody in the room seemed to mind not encoding the rifle,” said a Unicode Consortium member present during the discussion.

The two characters will still be part of the Unicode spec, but they'll be classed as black-and-white "symbols" instead of regular emoji. Companies that want to add them to their emoji keyboards still can (Google already integrated both into the Android N betas), but they may or may not be supported on other platforms. Both characters were originally included because they were parts of Olympic sports, according to Unicode President Mark Davis.

Apple has historically been a bit conservative about the more violent emoji—for quite a while, the gun, knife, and a few others were excluded from the macOS emoji picker even though the OS could display them just fine and they were included on the iOS emoji keyboard.

The final version of the Unicode 9.0 spec is scheduled to be released on June 21. Google and Microsoft have already included Unicode 9.0 emoji in the OS updates they're releasing this fall, and Apple will presumably do the same when it's ready.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Choir singing is known to promote wellbeing. One reason for this may be that singing demands a slower than normal respiration, which may in turn affect heart activity. Coupling of heart rate variability (HRV) to respiration is called Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). This coupling has a subjective as well as a biologically soothing effect, and it is beneficial for cardiovascular function. RSA is seen to be more marked during slow-paced breathing and at lower respiration rates (0.1 Hz and below). In this study, we investigate how singing, which is a form of guided breathing, affects HRV and RSA. The study comprises a group of healthy 18 year olds of mixed gender. The subjects are asked to; (1) hum a single tone and breathe whenever they need to; (2) sing a hymn with free, unguided breathing; and (3) sing a slow mantra and breathe solely between phrases. Heart rate (HR) is measured continuously during the study. The study design makes it possible to compare above three levels of song structure. In a separate case study, we examine five individuals performing singing tasks (1–3). We collect data with more advanced equipment, simultaneously recording HR, respiration, skin conductance and finger temperature. We show how song structure, respiration and HR are connected. Unison singing of regular song structures makes the hearts of the singers accelerate and decelerate simultaneously. Implications concerning the effect on wellbeing and health are discussed as well as the question how this inner entrainment may affect perception and behavior.

Introduction

This paper aims to illuminate and discuss how singing (Grape et al., 2003) and especially choir singing (Marti, 2012) promotes wellbeing. We focus on the interplay between two oscillators: the respiratory organ and the heart, while singing. The heart does not keep a constant rhythm. On the contrary, heart rate (HR) is accelerating and decelerating constantly. This fluctuation in HR is called heart rate variability (HRV). In this article, we mainly speak of the dynamic aspects of HRV, i.e., how HR develops over time forming cycles of HR fluctuations, but we also measure HRV by RMSSD (Root Mean Square of the Successive Differences) (Degiorgio et al., 2010).

It is known that HRV and respiration rate affect each other. This interdependency, first discussed by (Ludwig, 1847), is referred to as respiratory sinus

Politicians who rest their demands for more redistribution on studies of income inequality but leave out the existing safety net are putting their thumb on the scale.

Second and more important, it is well known that people's earnings in general rise over their working lifetime. And so, for example, a person who decides to invest more in education may experience a lengthy period of low income while studying, followed by significantly higher income later on. Snapshot measures of income inequality can be misleading.

According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Expenditure Survey, if you sort households according to their pretax income, in 2010 the bottom fifth accounted for 8.7% of overall consumption, the middle fifth for 17.1%, and the top fifth for about 38.6%. Go back 10 years to 2000—before two recessions, the Bush tax cuts, and continuing expansions of globalization and computerization—and the numbers are similar. The bottom fifth accounted for 8.9% of consumption, the middle fifth for 17.3%, and the top fifth for 37.3%.

While this stability is something to applaud, surely more important are the real gains in consumption by income groups over the past decade. From 2000 to 2010, consumption has climbed 14% for individuals in the bottom fifth of households, 6% for individuals in the middle fifth, and 14.3% for individuals in the top fifth when we account for changes in U.S. population and the size of households. This despite the dire economy at the end of the decade.

The percentage of low-income households with microwave ovens grew to 92.4% from 74.9% between 2001 and 2009. Fully 75.5% of low-income Americans now have a cell phone, and over a quarter of those have access to the Internet through their phones.

We would hazard a guess that if you were to ask a typical low-income American in 2009 if he would like to trade his house for its 2001 version, he would tell you to take a hike. How then is he worse off in 2009?

So poor people are not in fact getting worse off because when they get worse off, we give them food stamps. That's exactly the sort of deep thinking I would

FILE PHOTO: A copy of bitcoin standing on PC motherboard is seen in this illustration picture, October 26, 2017. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo

The price of bitcoin topped $11,000 on Wednesday less than a day after passing the $10,000 mark and has increased more than 10-fold in value so far this year, prompting concerns of a bubble.

CME Group, the world’s largest derivatives exchange, and CBOE Holdings, have both said they plan to launch futures products based on bitcoin this year, pending regulatory approval, helping fuel the crypto-currency’s rally.

While Nasdaq does not have a hard date set for its product, the transatlantic exchange operator has offered an exchange-traded note based on bitcoin on its Stockholm exchange since 2015.

Nasdaq has teamed up with New York-based money manager VanEck to develop the futures contract, which will be cleared by the Options Clearing Corporation. The OCC clears all Nasdaq futures products, the source said.

VanEck had applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this year to launch a bitcoin-related exchange-traded fund, but withdrew the request in September after speaking with SEC staff, according to a regulatory filing.

The SEC requested that VanEck wait until the underlying instruments in which the ETF planned to primarily invest - bitcoin futures contracts - become available for investment, the filing said.

A representative for VanEck was not immediately available for comment.

One of the ways the Nasdaq futures product will differ from CME’s and CBOE’s is that it will be based on an index that takes in prices from more than 50 bitcoin exchanges, the source said.

CME has said it’s bitcoin future will be based on the CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR), a once-a-day reference rate of the U.S. dollar price of bitcoin, that currently takes prices from four bitcoin exchanges. CBOE will price its bitcoin future off the Gemini Trust, the digital currency exchange founded by brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

The SEC in March denied a request for CBOE to list what would have been the first U.S. ETF built to track bitcoin.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>"You must be the only person worried about inflation, Liam". So I was told on Newsnight last week – by someone who's spent four of the last five years in the cabinet.

Almost lost for words, I blurted an answer before Mr Paxman intervened.

But I left the television studio shocked that the former minister, someone of genuine ability, could be so ignorant of life beyond the Westminster village.

"Inflation, not deflation" is a recurrent theme of this column. That's because the Western world's response to the "credit crunch", this orgy of wildly expansive policy using "deflation is nigh" as an alibi, amounts to a repeated whacking of the self-destruct button.

Almost everyone outside the "political and media elite" knows this. Amidst "deflation is upon us" warnings from this elite, UK CPI inflation went up last month – to 3.2pc. CPI understates true inflation. But even CPI is above the Bank of England's target – and has been for 17 months.

So if I'm the only one worried, why is Mervyn King writing repeated letters acknowledging inflation is too high?

Sterling is down a third in 18 months. Import prices are soaring. The UK's monetary base is doubling.

"Broad" M4 money is expanding at 16pc a year. Food price inflation is 8pc, with double-digit producer price inflation too – as the credit crunch destroys supply chains.

Warren Buffett, the most successful living investor, foresees an "inflation onslaught". Peter Brabeck, the Nestlé chairman and one of the world's top businessmen, says "Now the printing machine is starting, this is the start of inflation."

China and other major creditors are rightly concerned Western governments – particularly the US and UK – want to inflate away their sovereign debts.

That's why the "bond vigilantes" are stirring and we could very soon face a gilts strike.

If I'm the only one worried about inflation, why is the price of gold so high, with the price of commodities also up sharply – even though the global demand outlook is weak?

If I'm the only one worried about inflation, why does the latest report of the Bank of England's pension scheme show it recently changed it allocation of index-linked instruments – the ultimate anti-inflation hedge – from 25pc to more than 70pc of its portfolio?

Am I the only one worried? I so wish that was true. We face an inflation tsunami. And

Half of this oil is to come from the SPR of the United States; the rest is to come from SPRs of other members of OECD.

Both the amount and the timing of the release are strange. The amount of the release is equivalent to 2 million barrels a day. This is actually more than the Libyan disruption took off the market, which was about 1.4 million barrels a day. The disruption first took place in February, and oil prices have been declining since early May, so the timing is strange, as well.

What the timing of the oil release is close to, is the end of Quantitative Easing 2 (QE2). QE2 is the United States’ program of buying back debt to keep interest rates low and the dollar low, which began November 2010 and is scheduled to end June 30, 2011. It was intended to stimulate the economy, and oil prices have indeed risen during most of the time it was in effect.

Today’s announcement of the SPR oil-release program was made by IEA, but a person can’t help but wonder if the United States wasn’t heavily involved in the decision. After all, the United States is the largest member of the IEA, and is making half the release itself. Also, when Ben Bernanke spoke yesterday, he didn’t have any financial replacement for QE2. The release of oil from the SPR looks as if it is the latest attempt to kick-start the economy, both of the US and other OECD countries, using yet another approach.

If we look at oil price and the S&P 500 Index (Figure 2), there has been a significant correlation between the two since late 2008. When oil prices drop, so does the S&P 500 Index, most likely since this means the economy is “tanking.” When oil prices rise, so does the S&P 500 Index, indicating the economy is working well.

The problem is that high oil prices soon sow the seed of their own destruction. Once the oil price starts getting high (over $85 is high, over $110 is very high), the high oil prices start causing recessionary influences, because citizens have to cut back on other goods, when oil and food prices start rising. Oil and food prices usually rise and fall

16 July 2015

Share

A ceremony was held in Beijing yesterday to mark the official launch of China's State Power Investment Corporation (SPI), formed through the merger of China Power Investment Corporation (CPI) and State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation (SNPTC).

A plan for the merger of China's general contractor for reactors SNPTC and nuclear power plant operator CPI was submitted to the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) for approval by SNPTC in July 2014. The merger was approved by the State Council on 29 May.

The combined company formally established yesterday has a registered capital of CNY 45 billion ($7 billion), with total assets of CNY 722.3 billion ($116.3 billion) and, due to CPI's numerous subsidiaries and their extensive activities, almost 14 million employees in total. The business encompasses hydro, thermal and nuclear power, as well as new energy sources. SPI has an installed generating capacity of 98 gigawatts. The company also covers electricity, coal, aluminium production, logistics, finance and other sectors. Annual sales are expected to exceed CNY 200 billion ($32 billion).

CPI is one of five state-owned power generation holding companies formed from the State Power Corporation in 2002 and inheriting all of its nuclear capacity. It owns 19 operating power plants above 1000 MWe each, a majority of Shandong Haiyang nuclear power project, 45% of the first phase of Liaoning Hongyanhe nuclear power project, and holds minority shares in five nuclear power plants in operation, and three under construction. It is preparing nuclear power projects in Guangxi, Liaoning, Hunan, Jilin and Chongqing.

SNPTC was set up in 2004 to take charge of technology selection for new plants bid from overseas. The company was directly under China's State Council and closely connected with it, being owned 70% by SASAC and with 10% of shares owned by each of China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), CPI and China General Nuclear Corporation (CGN).

SPI chairman Wang Binghua, former chairman of SNPTC, was cited by China's CCTV as saying that China relies on fossil fuels for nearly 70% of its electricity needs, "leaving a large space" for nuclear power. He added that SPI, CNNC and CGN will enjoy strategic cooperation and healthy competition.

<|begin_of_text|>The headline on a recent piece by Ylan Mui of the Washington Post—“Why the Fed is rethinking everything”—captured the current moment well. The Federal Reserve has indeed been revising its views on some key aspects of the economy, and that’s been affecting its outlook both for the economy and for monetary policy. In this post I document and explain the ongoing shift in the Fed’s economic views. I then turn to some implications, suggesting among other things that, for now at least, Fed-watchers should probably focus on incoming data and count a bit less on Fed policymakers for guidance.

Talking about the “Fed’s thinking” is of course very loose. There are few official communications from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) as a whole, and those that exist (such as the statements issued after each FOMC meeting) have the prose style that might be expected of a document prepared by a large committee. The usual practice therefore is to try to infer the FOMC’s policy inclinations from the views expressed by individual FOMC participants in various forums. To quantify changes in the thinking of FOMC participants, I use in this post the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections, a summary of participants’ forecasts that the Committee releases four times a year.

Shifting views on the economy. Each quarter, individual FOMC participants—the Washington-based members of the Fed’s Board of Governors and all 12 of the regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents—submit their projections of how they expect certain key economic variables to evolve over the next 2-3 years and in the longer run. “Longer-run” projections are defined by the Fed as the values to which the variables in question are expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy; these projections can thus be thought of as the “steady-state” or “normal” levels of the variables, to which the economy tends over time. I’ll focus here on FOMC participants’ longer-run projections of three variables—output growth, the unemployment rate, and the policy interest rate (the federal funds rate)—and designate these longer-run values by y*, u*, and r*, respectively. Under the interpretation that these projections equal participants’ estimates of steady-state values, each of these variables is of fundamental importance for thinking about the behavior of the economy:

Projections of y* can be thought of as estimates of potential output growth, that is, the economy’s attainable rate of growth in the long run when resources

A great swathe of Pluto that features a strange rippling terrain is perhaps the highlight of the latest image release from the New Horizons mission.

The Nasa probe, which flew by the dwarf planet in July, continues to downlink its data, and as it comes in, the scientists get to work on it.

The ripples stretch for many hundreds of km.

"It looks more like tree bark or dragon scales than geology," observed mission team member Bill McKinnon.

"This'll really take time to figure out; maybe it's some combination of internal tectonic forces and ice sublimation driven by Pluto's faint sunlight," the Washington University, St Louis, scientist said in a US space agency release.

The best way to look at "scales" is to browse the new high-resolution enhanced colour view of Pluto that has been made available (PNG file, 70MB). The features are on the far eastern edge.

Image copyright NASA/JPLJHU/SWRI Image caption The image resolves details and colours on scales as small as 1.3km

This super image comes from the Ralph/Multispectral Visual Imaging Camera on New Horizons. It combines blue, red and near infrared (NIR) images.

The enhanced view will help decode the various geological and climatological processes that have worked together to produce all the complex surface features seen on Pluto.

Alex Parker, a team member from the Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, worked on the Ralph portrait.

"This image consumed the better part of this week for me," he tweeted.

"I removed striping noise and deconvolved the images, massively improving sharpness.

"Since the NIR, red and blue images used to make this colour composite are taken separately, they have to be precisely aligned in software.

"The instrument is a TDI (time delay and integration) camera, and has funny spatial distortions. I removed all of these by hand to create the final colour product."

Companies added 158,000 positions for the month, a number that economists who released the report said was still strong but stood well below the robust 230,000 number the report showed in May. The reading also was considerably below the 185,000 gain that economists surveyed by Reuters expected, and was revised lower from the initial 253,000 count.

"The job market continues to power forward," Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said in a statement. "At this pace, which is double the rate of labor force growth, the tight labor market will continue getting tighter."

The ADP/Moody's release comes a day before the government's closely watched monthly nonfarm payrolls count. The market is expecting that report to show a gain of about 180,000 jobs in June. However, the two numbers sometimes don't mesh — in May, the ADP count of 230,000 was well ahead of the 138,000 in the Bureau of Labor Statistics report.

All of the June jobs in the ADP/Moody's count came from services, with professional and business positions showing the biggest gain at 69,000. Administrative and support services contributed 43,000 while the trade, transportation and utilities category grew by 30,000.

On the other side of the ledger, education lost 6,000 jobs, natural resources and mining declined by 4,000 and construction fell by 2,000.

Businesses with 50 to 499 employees led the way with 91,000, while large firms added 50,000. Small business, which has led job creation through much of the recovery, saw growth of just 17,000 for the month.

Federal Reserve policymakers are watching the employment reports closely. Officials at the central bank are curious not only about job creation but also the effect that a tightening labor market is having on wages. Salary growth has remained muted for much of the recovery, and June is expected to show an annualized gain of 2.6 percent. Minutes released Wednesday from the June meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee indicate that the Fed is likely to raise rates at least once more this year and to begin reducing its $4.5 trillion balance sheet portfolio of bonds, despite the lack of inflation pressures.

According to Oxford Dictionary the term Slave is defined as “a person who is the legal property of another and is forced to obey them” as in the case of the United States during the 18th and 19th centuries where slavery was a legalized institution. Oxford dictionary also defines slavery as “a person who works very hard without proper remuneration or appreciation” as in today’s world of a person working for a company or corporation where their efforts are usually under appreciated. It also describes a slave as “a person who is excessively dependent upon or controlled by something” or “a device, or part of one, directly controlled by another”. Debt can be an instrument used to control an individual or a nation for that matter. In this case, an individual is dependent upon “Credit” to buy products.

Then the credit becomes a debt that has to be repaid. It becomes a “control mechanism” as the creditor becomes the “Slave Owner” and the debtor becomes the “Slave”. What is the point? In today’s world of unlimited credit, consumers become modern-day slaves to their creditors. What is the difference between slavery in 18th century America with imported African slaves and the America of 2013? There is no difference besides the physical abuse of the African slaves by their owners. In America, consumers suffer psychological abuse by its creditors. As long as an individual remains in debt bondage, that person will have to repay that debt until the day that person literally dies in most cases.

Black Friday is the day that starts the most important holiday for big name retailers and Wall Street speculators and that is Christmas. It is the shopping season that investors, economists and corporations pay close attention to as they measure consumer confidence and the profits they reap from consumer spending. Major retailers and corporations such as Wal-Mart expect to make profits. Wall Street expects consumers to spend on Black Friday through the Christmas holidays following the Federal Reserve’s continued policies of Quantitative Easing (QE). Economists across the spectrum predict that the new Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen will continue to buy US bonds indefinitely continuing Ben Bernanke’s current policies.

He is ashamed to have others view his penis, especially in the flaccid state. Such concerns might be unfounded in reality and might be a presentation of social anxiety or some other clinical problem, such as erectile dysfunction. Concern over the size of the penis, when such concern becomes excessive, might present as the ‘small penis syndrome’, an obsessive rumination with compulsive checking rituals, body dysmorphic disorder, or as part of a psychosis. However, it is often a worry that can be described as within the normal experience of many men. Various potential causal factors are considered. A thorough assessment, normalizing the worry and then exploring the treatment options in detail with the man, is essential to allow the matter to be consolidated satisfactorily within the male ego.

Abbreviations SPS small penis syndrome BDD body dysmorphic disorder (dysmorphophobia) ED erectile dysfunction CBT cognitive behavioural therapy SSRI selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.

INTRODUCTION The penis, particularly in its erect state, is a symbol of masculinity. In many cultures it has come to symbolise attributes such as ‘largeness, strength, endurance, ability, courage, intelligence, knowledge, dominance over men, possession of women; a symbol of loving and being loved’. A review [1] is recommended which describes Indian Sadhus using weights, Dayak men in Borneo piercing the glans and then inserting items in the resultant holes to stimulate the partner, and the Topinama of Brazil, who encourage poisonous snakes to bite their penis to make it enlarge (for 6 months!). Some of these concepts date back over many thousands of years, and there is evidence that prehistoric cave dwellers attributed the symbolic values of strength and power to penile size, as well as those of virility and fertility, a process also recommended in the Kama Sutra [2]. Given the historical context it is perhaps no surprise that even today many men place great importance on the size of their penis. Hegemonic masculinity is defined by attributes such as physical strength, heterosexuality with authority over women and other men, showing no emotions (such as remorse and uncertainty, which might suggest vulnerability), economic independence, and an ability to demonstrate sexual ‘conquest’. While most men do not embody all of these qualities, society supports hegemonic masculinity within most of its institutions [3].

<|begin_of_text|>The Formula One World Constructors' Championship (WCC) is awarded by the FIA to the most successful Formula One constructor over a season, as determined by a points system based on Grand Prix results. The Constructors' Championship was first awarded, as the International Cup for F1 Manufacturers, in 1958 to Vanwall.

Constructors' Championship points are calculated by adding points scored in each race by any driver for that constructor. Up until 1979, most seasons saw only the highest-scoring driver in each race for each constructor contributing points towards the Championship. On only ten occasions has the World Constructors' Champion team not contained the World Drivers' Champion for that season.

In the 61 seasons the Championship has been awarded, only 15 different constructors have won it, with Scuderia Ferrari the most successful, with 16 titles including 6 consecutive from 1999 to 2004. Only five countries have produced winning constructors: United Kingdom (33 championships with 10 different constructors), Italy (16 with Ferrari), Germany (5 with Mercedes), Austria (4 with Red Bull) and France (3 with two constructors). However, all German, Austrian and French titles have seen the winning cars designed and built (except Matra in 1969) and run by teams based in the United Kingdom. Among drivers that have contributed with at least a single point to the constructors' title, Michael Schumacher has the unofficial record, having been involved with seven such titles, six of those consecutively with Ferrari.[1] Schumacher won the world drivers' title on six of those seven occasions.

Net worth boosted by stocks, housing

Consumer credit growth may be slowing in Canada, but the key measure of household debt has hit a record.

That measure, household credit market debt to disposable income, climbed in the third quarter of the year to 163.7 per cent, from a revised 163.1 per cent in the previous three-month period, Statistics Canada said Friday.

At the same time, the net worth of Canadian families rose 2.2 per cent, buoyed by rising stock markets and property values.

Story continues below advertisement

On a per-capita basis, net worth among Canadian households rose in the latest quarter to $211,400, though that masks the income inequality across the country.

"Shares and other equities grew on the basis of the rebound in domestic and foreign equity markets," Statistics Canada said.

"The increase in household net worth was also supported by a 1.5-per-cent gain in the value of household real estate."

The higher debt burden could well spell trouble for some families when interest rates inevitably rise, though the Bank of Canada is believed to be more than a year away from such a move.

Here are some of the highlights from the federal agency's report:

Household net worth rose by 2.2 per cent to $211,000, led by a 3.7-per-cent rise in the stock market.

Real estate values rose by 1.5 per cent.

Consumer credit debt rose by 1 per cent to $505-billion.

The consumer credit debt to disposable income ratio climbed to 163.7 per cent from 163.1 per cent.

Mortgage debts rose by 1.8 per cent to $1.1-trillion, compared with the average quarterly growth of 1.7 per cent over the past five years.

National net worth climbed 2.1 per cent to $7.5-trillion, or, on a per-capita basis, $212,700. That's a slower pace than the second quarter's 3.2-per-cent rise.

Home sales, of course, have rebounded smartly in Canada since the short government-induced slump in the summer of 2012, brought on by new mortgage insurance restrictions aimed at stopping a bubble.

Some of that is deemed to be the result of home buyers jumping in earlier than they otherwise would have because of higher mortgage rates and speculation of further increases.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City released the March Manufacturing Survey today. According to Chad Wilkerson, vice president and economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, the survey revealed that Tenth District manufacturing activity strengthened further with strong expectations for future activity.

“Our composite index accelerated again, and has only been higher one time in the last 15 years,” said Wilkerson. “The future employment index was the strongest in the 23-year history of the survey."

...

The month-over-month composite index was 20 in March, its highest reading since March 2011, up from 14 in February and 9 in March. The composite index is an average of the production, new orders, employment, supplier delivery time, and raw materials inventory indexes. Activity in both durable and nondurable goods plants increased, particularly for metals, computer, electronic, and aircraft products. Most month-over-month indexes rose further in March. The production and shipments indexes increased considerably, while the new orders and order backlog indexes rose more moderately but remained high. The employment index moderated slightly from 17 to 13, and the new orders for exports index also eased. Both inventory indexes increased for the second straight month.

emphasis added

The Kansas City region was hit hard by the decline in oil prices, but activity is expanding solidly again. The regional Fed surveys released so far suggest another strong reading for the ISM manufacturing index for March.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Fresh Christmas trees are a holiday tradition, loved for their beauty and fresh, outdoorsy fragrance. However, Christmas trees often take the blame for destructive fires that occur during the holiday season. The most effective way to prevent Christmas tree fires is to keep the tree well hydrated. With proper care, a tree should remain fresh for two to three weeks. This may sound easy, but it becomes a problem if your Christmas tree is not drinking water.

Causes for a Christmas Tree Not Taking Up Water

Generally, when Christmas trees have problems taking up water, it’s because we tend to add products to the tree itself or the water. Avoid spray-on fire retardants and other products advertised to keep your tree fresh. Similarly, bleach, vodka, aspirin, sugar, lime soda, copper pennies or vodka have little or no effect and some can actually slow water retention and increase moisture loss.

What works best? Plain old tap water. If you tend to be forgetful, keep a pitcher or watering can near the tree to remind you.

How to Get a Christmas Tree to Take Up Water

Cutting a thin sliver from the bottom of the trunk is key to keeping a tree fresh. Keep in mind that if the tree is freshly cut, you don’t need to cut the trunk. However, if the tree has been cut for longer than 12 hours before you put it in water, you must trim ¼ to ½ inch from the bottom of the trunk.

This is because the bottom of the trunk seals itself with sap after a few hours and can’t absorb water. Cut straight across and not at an angle; an angular cut makes it harder for the tree to take up water. It is also difficult to get a tree with an angular cut to stand upright. Also, don’t drill a hole in the trunk. It doesn’t help.

Next, a large stand is critical; a Christmas tree can drink up to one quart of water for each inch of stem diameter. The National Christmas Tree Association recommends a stand with a one-gallon capacity. Never trim the bark to accommodate a too-tight stand. The bark helps the tree take up water.

Christmas Tree Watering Tips

Start with a fresh Christmas tree. There’s no way to hydrate a dried up tree, even if you trim the bottom. If you aren’t sure about freshness, pull a branch slowly through your fingers. A few dry needles are no reason for concern, but look for a fresher tree if a large number of needles are loose or brittle.

—Charles Dana, managing editor of the New York Tribune, and Lincoln’s assistant secretary of war, 1848

The workingmen of Europe feel sure that, as the American War of Independence initiated a new era of ascendancy for the middle class, so the American Antislavery War will do for the working classes. They consider it an earnest of the epoch to come that it fell to the lot of Abraham Lincoln, the single-minded son of the working class, to lead his country through the matchless struggle for the rescue of an enchained race and the reconstruction of a social world.

—Karl Marx and the First International Workingmen’s Association to Lincoln, 1864

ON DECEMBER 3, 1861, a former one-term congressman, who had spent most of the past dozen years studying dissident economic theories, mounting challenges to the existing political order and proposing ever more radical responses to the American crisis, delivered his first State of the Union address as the sixteenth president of the United States.

Since assuming office eight months earlier, this new president had struggled, without success, first to restore the severed bonds of the Union and then to avert a wrenching civil war. Now, eleven southern slave states were in open and violent rebellion against the government he led.

His inaugural address of the previous spring had closed with a poignant reflection on the prospect of eventual peace, imagining a day when the Union might again be touched “by the better angels of our nature.” But, now, in the last month of what Walt Whitman would recall as America’s “sad, distracted year”—“Year that suddenly sang by the mouths of the round-lipp’d cannons”—the better angels seemed to have deserted the continent. Every effort to restore the republic had been thwarted. There was no room for accommodation with the Confederate States of America. Fort Sumter had been fired upon and the flag of southern rebellion now flew above Charleston Harbor. Virginia, the cradle of presidents, the state of Washington, Jefferson and Madison, had joined the revolt and assembled a capital of the Confederacy less than 100 miles from Washington. Hundreds of Union and Confederate soldiers had died, with thousands more wounded at the First Battle of Bull Run. Armies had been reorganized and generals replaced with the recognition that this was no skirm

But almost half of those who have found a place are straining their finances to keep those roofs over their heads, according to data contained in Wednesday’s Census release.

Coverage of renting in Vancouver on Globalnews.ca:

This week, Statistics Canada released “Housing in Canada: key results from the 2016 Census,” a dataset showing how much the country’s housing landscape has changed over the past decade.

Data contained in the release showed that just over 43 per cent of renters are spending 30 per cent or more of their income on shelter in the Vancouver Census Metropolitan Area (CMA).

The CMA covers an area that includes municipalities such as Vancouver, Richmond, Surrey, North Vancouver and Langley.

The Census release showed that, out of 348,700 renters identified in the Census, 150,505 (43.2 per cent) were spending 30 per cent or more of their income on shelter costs in 2015.

The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) says housing can be considered affordable if it takes up less than 30 per cent of before-tax household income.

Therefore, more than 43 per cent of residents in the Vancouver CMA were living in housing that can’t necessarily be considered affordable.

Census data compiled by Andy Yan, director of the SFU City Program, shows varying levels of renters living in “unaffordable” housing across Metro Vancouver’s municipalities.

In the City of Vancouver, 44.2 per cent of renters were living in housing that took up 30 per cent or more of their income.

The highest share of renters living in housing they couldn’t afford was observed in Lions Bay, where the share was 66.7 per cent.

The lowest share was witnessed in Anmore, where it was 25 per cent.

But that’s not the only figure suggesting that Metro Vancouverites are spending more than they can technically afford on a place to live.

Data crunched by the B.C. Non-Profit Housing Association (BCNPHA) shows that 22 per cent of renters were spending at least half of their before-tax income on shelter.

Either way, the share of renters paying more than 30 per cent is significant, said Nathanael Lauster, a UBC professor and the author of The Death and Life of the Single-Family House: Lessons from Vancouver on Building a Livable City.

<|begin_of_text|>Where did the gains from productivity go? Well, they went to the top. Household income, adjusted for inflation, has grown 12X more for the top 1% than for the middle 20%... and 24X more than the bottom 20%.

The full story of income inequality cannot simply be told with wages, where the 40-year growth gap between the top 10% and the rest is "only" about two-to-one.

To understand the full story, you have to look at capital income -- from assets like housing and stocks and bonds. This is where income growth for the top 1% has positively exploded, taking income inequality to record highs.

This is not a new trend. This is an old trend going back to before the Reagan administration. Since 1979, the top 5% took home more than half of total income growth. The top 1% took nearly 40%.

EPI's conclusion that health care costs and technology have nothing to do with stagnating wages for the middle class is controversial (see here and here for other takes). But its diagnosis for the three "wage gaps" is still compelling. Slide here, graphs to follow.

First, let's look at the gap between the super-super rich and the rest. About 60% of the increase in the top 1%'s share of total income seems to come from the expansion of the financial sector and the explosion in executive pay in non-financial compensation.

At the same time that their incomes have grown, effective tax rates on the super-super rich have fallen, especially since our laws give preference to income from capital gains. This is huge, because the top 1% has controlled more than 40% of stock market wealth since the 1980s. The next 9% owns another 40%. Stock wealth hasn't exactly democratized.

Since 1960, average effective tax rates have fallen dramatically for the top 0.1% -- much of it thanks to preferences for capital gains income. Progressive taxation won't fix the middle class crisis, Mishel pointed out to me over the phone, but it can discourage sky-high CEO salaries and provide more public funds to pay for infrastructure, education, and a safety net.

We're moving from the tippy-top of income to the very bottom here. As taxes have fallen at the top, the minimum wage has fallen at the bottom. In 1964, the minimum wage was about 50% of the average worker's hourly earnings.

<|begin_of_text|>The gustatory system creates the human sense of taste, allowing us to perceive different flavors from substances that we consume as food and drink. Gustation, along with olfaction (the sense of smell), is classified as chemoreception. Because it functions by reacting with molecular chemical compounds in a given substance. Specialized cells in the gustatory system that are located on the tongue are called taste buds, and they sense tastants (taste molecules). The taste buds send the information after coming in contact with food from the tastants to the brain, where a molecule is processed as a certain taste. There are five main tastes: bitter, salty, sweet, sour, and umami (savory). All the varieties of flavor we experience are a combination of some or all of these tastes.

The sense of taste is transduced by taste buds. Which are clusters of 50-100 taste receptor cells located in the tongue, soft palate, epiglottis, pharynx, and esophagus. The tongue is the main sensory organ of the gustatory system. The tongue contains papillae, or specialized epithelial cells, which have taste buds on their surface. There are three types of papillae with taste buds in the human gustatory system:

Loading...

fungiform papillae, which are mushroom-shaped and located at the tip of the tongue;

foliate papillae, which are ridges and grooves toward the back of the tongue;

circumvallate papillae, which are circular-shaped and located in a row just in front of the end of the tongue.

You can’t taste food unless it’s mixed with your saliva

Each taste bud is flask-like in shape and formed by two types of cells: supporting cells and gustatory cells. Gustatory cells are short-lived and are continuously regenerating. They each contain a taste pore at the surface of the tongue which is the site of sensory transduction. Though there are small differences in sensation, all taste buds, no matter their location, can respond to all types of taste.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Minyanville.com had the headline, “Velocity of Money Comes to a Standstill.” The report starts off with the news that “Current consumption, which at $8.2 trillion is around 70% of GDP, has fallen $150 billion from last year,” and that investment, which represents things like building factories, is $1.3 trillion or 11% of GDP, and down 23.3% from last year.”

This is certainly bad news, although I am always leery of the concept of velocity, as it is just the plug number that makes Fisher’s famous equation (MV = PQ) work out, namely that the Money supply times the turnover of the money (Velocity) equals the Quantity of things sold times the Price of those things that were sold. Simple.

So since the Money supply (as measured by M2) is growing at almost 9%, Prices overall (as measured by the broad CPI) are not growing very much, and the Quantity of goods sold is way down as consumers stop consuming since they are out of money and credit, then Velocity must, by arithmetical necessity, be going down. Now do you know something that you didn’t already know?

But perhaps this seeming fascination with velocity has something to do with why Bloomberg.com reports that “U.S. household wealth fell in the first quarter by $1.3 trillion, extending the biggest slump on record, as home and stock prices dropped.” Yikes! And in just the first three months of the year!

You may be thinking to yourself, “Well, since the Worthless Mogambo Idiot (WMI) goes ballistic at the drop of a hat these days, probably as a result of his having such a tenuous and apparently transitory grasp of reality, maybe he is just over-reacting, and this is not so much.”

If you are one of those people who thinks such things, then I laugh – Hahaha! – in your face, and in response to the quizzical look on your face at my sudden rude arrogance, I hold up the rest of the article where it says, “Net worth for households and non-profit groups” is a nice, tidy $50.4 trillion, which seems like a lot of money, but which is actually the “lowest level since 2004,” and which was down from $51.7 trillion in the fourth quarter.

New medications with faster onset are needed. As converging evidence suggests a role for the glutamate system in the pathophysiology of OCD, we tested whether a single dose of ketamine, a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist, could achieve rapid anti-obsessional effects. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, drug-free OCD adults (n=15) with near-constant obsessions received two 40-min intravenous infusions, one of saline and one of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg), spaced at least 1-week apart. The OCD visual analog scale (OCD-VAS) and the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) were used to assess OCD symptoms. Unexpectedly, ketamine's effects within the crossover design showed significant (p<0.005) carryover effects (ie, lasting longer than 1 week). As a result, only the first-phase data were used in additional analyses. Specifically, those receiving ketamine (n=8) reported significant improvement in obsessions (measured by OCD-VAS) during the infusion compared with subjects receiving placebo (n=7). One-week post-infusion, 50% of those receiving ketamine (n=8) met criteria for treatment response (≥35% Y-BOCS reduction) vs 0% of those receiving placebo (n=7). Rapid anti-OCD effects from a single intravenous dose of ketamine can persist for at least 1 week in some OCD patients with constant intrusive thoughts. This is the first randomized, controlled trial to demonstrate that a drug affecting glutamate neurotransmission can reduce OCD symptoms without the presence of an SRI and is consistent with a glutamatergic hypothesis of OCD.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>EspañolThe value of the Venezuelan bolívar has plummeted in the past month, depreciating from 102.56 to 159.02 per US dollar on the black-market exchange. November’s decline indicates that Venezuela now flirts with hyperinflation.

The rule of thumb among economists is that hyperinflation occurs when inflation — the declining purchasing power of a currency as measured by a rise in the price level — exceeds 50 percent on a monthly basis. As deduced from the black-market exchange rate and the US Consumer Price Index, Venezuela’s inflation for November reached 55.27 percent.* Even the highest denomination of the bolívar, the 100 Bs. note, is now worth a mere 62.9 US cents.

If Venezuela were to continue November’s free-fall trajectory for the bolívar, its annual compounded inflation would reach 19,633 percent.

While DolarToday is the most commonly referenced website for the bolívar’s informal exchange rates, Aguacate Verde and Lechuga Verde both uphold the trend (at 146 Bs. per US dollar). Of the three, DolarToday is the only one that offers a publicly available data record (Excel), enabling comparisons between past and present exchange rates.

The Bolívar’s Disappearing Act

In a country with three fixed official exchange rates — all with rationed supplies of foreign currencies — the informal rate has become the most accurate gauge of the bolívar’s underlying purchasing power.

“The black market rate is a very good indicator of what the exchange rate should be,” says Boris Ackerman, an economist and professor at Simon Bolívar University in Caracas. “Public expectations and speculation continue to drive the rate up despite strict financial controls enacted by the government.”

In an economy defined by crisis, Venezuelans are scrambling from the bolívar to take refuge in the US dollar, which offers a relatively more stable alternative and store of value. In response, President Nicolás Maduro has worked to steadily decrease the availability of US dollars within the country, even going so far as to outlaw transactions in greenbacks.

This year, the Chavista regime also introduced the third SICAD II rate, in an attempt to curb the thriving black market. However, the measure has since backfired, and the black-market exchange rate has more than doubled since SICAD II’s introduction in March.

Venezuela’s financial woes have come under immense criticism, including from prominent outlets such as the

<|begin_of_text|>Societe Generale Societe Generale's Albert Edwards has warned for some time that we are on the precipice of deflation.

But in his new note to clients, he seems utterly bemused. Markets just don't seem to care.

"Markets remain stoic about the risks of outright deflation in the US and eurozone for one very simple reason," he writes.

"They simply do not believe a recession that would trigger outright deflation is on the horizon. Quite the reverse - they believe with all their heart that we are at the start of a self-sustained recovery. That is despite the fact that the US recovery is already noticeably longer than average, and that the classic signs of old age, such as rapidly slowing productivity growth and stagnant corporate profits, can clearly be seen."

Market expectations of inflation — via the 10-year bond market — has "remained entrenched" above 2% for more than a year, Edwards writes.

"A chasm is growing between reality, both on a core and headline basis, and expectations," he says. "If investors begin to doubt the economy recovery then they will no longer be able to ignore the lurking deflationary threat. Rapid market moves would ensue."

Down go consumer confidence and real estate values to all-time lows, but, nevertheless, up goes the Dow undaunted, claiming its second largest point gain ever as the counterintuitive insider trading beat goes on and on and on, ad nausea. Insiders get wealthy, and the non-insiders chasing them get annihilated. This has been the story on Wall Street for over a century. Do you think it was merely some sort of serendipitous coincidence that the dark pool of liquidity, known as Project Turquoise, was set to be activated near the end of August, just in time for all the Illuminist insiders to enjoy the profitable fireworks as volatility reached all-time highs, so that all of their nefarious trading could be done in unregulated secrecy? We can assure you that there are no coincidences on Wall Street. There is only rampant, rampaging insider trading and fiendish manipulation.

Any time they think they are in need of a good fleecing, all the poor sheople have to do is get back into the general stock markets where their Illuminist shearers will be more than happy to oblige them. We absolutely guarantee that the pink of your sheople skin will be showing as all your wool is shaved off right down to the hair follicles. You've probably heard about "pink flamingos." Well, now we are going to see a lot of pink sheople wandering around aimlessly, wondering where all their vaporized money went, as they are prepared for the big slaughter while the Big Sting Two goes into its next phase. You need to protect yourself with gold, silver and their now bargain-basement related shares, unless of course the color pink flatters you.

The United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is predicting that the national debt of the US will double in 10 years. Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has raised its forecast of the 10-year cumulative budget deficit to US$7.137 trillion, due to increased spending. Both offices released reports on Tuesday.

"Over all, it underscores the dire fiscal situation that we inherited and the need for serious steps to put our nation back on a sustainable fiscal path," wrote Peter R. Orszag, President Barack Obama's budget director.

"I know that there will be some who say this report proves that we cannot afford health reform. I think that has it backward," Orszag said in a conference call.

The CBO report predicts that public debt will exceed 61% of gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of 2010 while continuing to rise to 68% of GDP by the end of 2019.

"If anyone had any doubts that this burden on future generations is unsustainable, they're gone," said Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader.

"Today's budget numbers send a clear signal that the time for putting off tough choices is over and the time to act is now," said the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Kent Conrad.

"While the U.S. health care system does need to be reformed, we cannot ignore the fiscal realities of our situation," said Senator Judd Gregg who is also on the Senate Budget Committee. "We must proceed with extreme caution before putting in place a huge and costly new program that will threaten our economy and the future of our children."

"The administration has always said that you have to get deficits under 3 percent of GDP to be safe. They now admit that they will not in the next 10 years," commented Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the CBO. "I'm stunned at how hard they have worked to bury this."

<|begin_of_text|>In macroeconomic models, if everything works perfectly -- if all markets clear at all points in time, prices are fully and instantaneously flexible, people have the information they need, and so on -- then monetary policy will have no affect on real variables such as output and employment. Only nominal variables such as the price level will change. This is known as monetary neutrality.

In order to get non-neutrality, i.e. in order to make it so that changes in the money supply can change real output and employment in a theoretical model, there must be a friction of some sort. One popular friction is price/wage rigidity, but it is not the only type of friction that can generate non-neutralities. Any friction that prevents optimal and instantaneous response to a shock will overcome neutrality and restore the ability of the Fed to affect the course of the real economy.

The point I want to emphasize is that the optimal monetary policy rule depends upon the underlying friction that is being used to generate non-neutralities in the theoretical model. For example, Calvo type price rigidity combined with some sort of social objective function such as maximizing the welfare of the representative household often gives you something that resembles the standard Taylor rule (though whether the level and/or the growth rates of price and output belong on the right-hand side of the Taylor rule depends upon the nature of the friction, i.e. even in this case the standard Taylor rule may not be the optimal rule).

I am willing to believe that during the Great Moderation the standard Taylor rule may have at least been close to the optimal rule. If you believe price frictions were the source of the mild fluctuations we had during that time, then theory tells us that's possible. What puzzles me is why people think the same rule should work now. I don't think that Calvo type price rigidities are the reason for the problems we are having right now, and hence this does not give us much insight and explanatory power for the Great Recession. Mild price sluggishness is plainly and simply not the dominant friction at work right now, and if that is the case, why would we think the same monetary policy rule should be optimal? If, in fact, there has been a switch in the dominant type of friction affecting the economy -- and I would argue there has been -- it would be quite remarkable for the same monetary policy rule to be optimal in both situations.

So, I have to agree with Paul Krugman:

<|begin_of_text|>Over the last year, and, in fact, over the last five years, nominal wage growth has been slow—slow by historic standards and slow relative to wage growth that would be consistent with the Fed’s 2 percent overall price inflation target. Hourly wage growth has run at about 2 percent a year and, as we’ve discussed in great length, 2 percent hourly wage growth is far below the 3.5-4 percent target growth that is consistent with the Fed’s target of 2 percent price inflation and a 1.5 to 2.0 percent trend in productivity growth.

Wage growth that exceeds this 3.5 to 4 percent target for a period of time is not an economic problem to be solved. Rather, it is a normal pattern of the labor share of corporate sector income finally recovering its pre Great Recession levels. If last month’s weak job growth is just a blip and healthy job growth continues in the next year, this should eventually lead to a labor market tight enough to finally provide workers with the bargaining power necessary to bid up their wages.

There has been some discussion that the sluggish wage growth we’ve seen since the recovery began in 2009 is driven in large part by the mix of jobs being created, as if we have lower wages simply because the economy is adding more low-wage jobs. Earlier in the recovery there was likely some truth to this, as lower-wage sectors saw the first pickup in job growth. However, over the last year jobs have been created throughout the economy in high-, low-, and middle- wage sectors. The evidence suggests that the economy has been adding jobs in proportion to the rate that those jobs already exist in the economy.

Let’s look at this by industrial sector. If we identify sectors as low-, middle-, and high-wage, there are several ways to cut the data. Here’s one way:

The economy-wide average hourly wage in the first quarter of 2015 was $24.80. There are several industries with wages right around the average, and a couple obviously lower and a few obviously higher.

So, now, let’s look at job creation. In the first quarter of 2014, low-wage jobs were 25.7 percent of the private sector economy. Over the last year, 26.6 percent of low-wage jobs added were in low-wage sectors. That looks relatively proportional. It’s a similar story at the middle and high ends of the wage-sector spectrum. Jobs are being added relatively in proportion to their share

<|begin_of_text|>We've mentioned a few times today that GDP went negative primarily because of the big drop in defense spending.

But we didn't realize just how historic the drop was.

JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli put it in context. The defense spending drop happened at the fastest pace in 40 years. As you can see in the chart below, the last time we had a faster drop was in 1972.

Below is Feroli's take:

Real GDP contracted at a 0.1% annual rate last quarter -- a disconcerting headline number which masked better underlying performance of the economy. The weakness in Q4 output was primarily driven by two factors: a 22% annualized drop in defense spending -- the most in forty years -- and a pullback in the pace of inventory accumulation, in part due to lingering effects of the drought. Absent these two factors the rest of the economy expanded at a relatively decent 2.5% pace last quarter.

Foreign trade subtracted another 0.3%-point from growth in Q4.

The two main components of private domestic demand, consumption and business fixed investment, actually accelerated last quarter, as consumers increased real outlays at a 2.2% rate and capital spending rebounded to an 8.4% growth pace.

Odd as it may sound, today's number actually leaves the economy relatively well-positioned heading into the first quarter; the slowing in the pace of inventory accumulation (real inventories were only built up at a $20.0 billion rate in Q4) means that businesses will not have to pull back on production as much in Q1 if consumer spending does downshift in response to the recent tax increases.

We continue to look for growth this quarter of around 1.0%, with modest upside risk due to the lean inventory situation and the decent momentum in private final demand.

Here's the chart:

<|begin_of_text|>Several fundamental ideas in calculus are more than 2000 years old. As a formal subdiscipline of mathematics, calculus was first introduced and developed in the late 1600s, with key independent contributions from Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Mathematicians agree that the subject has been understood rigorously since the work of Augustin Louis Cauchy and Karl Weierstrass in the mid 1800s when the field of modern analysis was developed, in part to make sense of the infinitely small quantities on which calculus rests. Hence, as a body of knowledge calculus has been completely understood by experts for at least 150 years. The discipline is one of our great human intellectual achievements: among many spectacular ideas, calculus models how objects fall under the forces of gravity and wind resistance, explains how to compute areas and volumes of interesting shapes, enables us to work rigorously with infinitely small and infinitely large quantities, and connects the varying rates at which quantities change to the total change in the quantities themselves.While each author of a calculus textbook certainly offers her own creative perspective on the subject, it is hardly the case that many of the ideas she presents are new. Indeed, the mathematics community broadly agrees on what the main ideas of calculus are, as well as their justification and their importance; the core parts of nearly all calculus textbooks are very similar. As such, it is our opinion that in the 21st century – an age where the internet permits seamless and immediate transmission of information – no one should be required to purchase a calculus text to read, to use for a class, or to find a coherent collection of problems to solve. Calculus belongs to humankind, not any individual author or publishing company. Thus, the main purpose of this work is to present a new calculus text that is free. In addition, instructors who are looking for a calculus text should have the opportunity to download the source files and make modifications that they see fit; thus this text is open-source. Since August 2013, Active Calculus has been endorsed by the American Institute of Mathematics and its Open Textbook Initiative<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Private cast iron bathtubs with porcelain interiors on "claw foot" pedestals rose to popularity in the 19th century

A bathtub, bath, or tub (informal) is a large or small container for holding water in which a person or animal may bathe. Most modern bathtubs are made of thermoformed acrylic, porcelain enameled steel, fiberglass-reinforced polyester, or porcelain enameled cast iron. A bathtub is usually placed in a bathroom either as a stand-alone fixture or in conjunction with a shower.

Modern bathtubs have overflow and waste drains and may have taps mounted on them. They are usually built-in, but may be free-standing or sometimes sunken. Until recently, most bathtubs were roughly rectangular in shape, but with the advent of acrylic thermoformed baths, more shapes are becoming available. Bathtubs are commonly white in colour, although many other colours can be found. The process for enamelling cast iron bathtubs was invented by the Scottish-born American David Dunbar Buick.

Two main styles of bathtub are common:

Western style bathtubs in which the bather lies down. These baths are typically shallow and long.

Eastern style bathtubs in which the bather sits up. These are known as furo in Japan and are typically short and deep.

History of bathtubs and bathing [ edit ]

Traditional bathtub (19th century) from Italy

Documented early plumbing systems for bathing go back as far as around 3300 BC with the discovery of copper water pipes beneath a palace in the Indus Valley Civilization of ancient India; see sanitation of the Indus Valley Civilization.[citation needed] Evidence of the earliest surviving personal sized bath tub was found on the Isle of Crete where a 1.5-metre (5 ft) long pedestal tub was found built from hardened pottery.[1]

The clawfoot tub, which reached the apex of its popularity in the late 19th century; had its origins in the mid 18th century, where the ball and claw design originated in Holland, possibly artistically inspired by the Chinese motif of a dragon holding a precious stone. The design spread to England where it found much popularity among the aristocracy, just as bathing was becoming increasingly fashionable. Early bathtubs in England tended to be made of cast iron, or even tin and copper with a face of paint applied that tended to peel with time.

The Scottish-born inventor David Buick invented a process for bonding porcelain enamel to cast iron in the

Cheap VPN services that we selected encrypt not only browsing activities, but offer a full VPN service to secure bitTorrent traffic, messaging, e-mail clients along with all communication tunneled through a device.

Even though VPN subscription is generally not too expensive, prices typically vary from $3 to $15 on monthly subscriptions, and $30 to $150 on annual accounts. The pricing depends on a combination of factors such as a number of servers and protocols, desktop and mobile custom apps, speed and reliability, advanced protection features and more. And while there are plenty of cheap VPN providers, quality of service, reliability and trustworthiness is paramount.

Having reviewed dozens of leading VPN services, we compiled a list of affordable VPN providers that, despite their cheap price, manage to deliver an excellent VPN protection to their users.

But the political unrest in the Middle East is having a negative effect on the markets thus far. What makes those revolutions different? The Middle East is a major source of the world's oil. Political uncertainty in the region leads to oil supply uncertainty. For that reason the recent events in nations like Egypt and Libya have been worrying investors and businesses: if less oil flows out of the region to the rest of the world, fuel prices will rise.

In fact, we're already seeing oil prices hit highs this week not seen in two-and-a-half years. These increases come after oil prices already began to rise moderately throughout much of 2010, as the global economy strengthened. High fuel costs could dampen global economic growth, since firms and consumers would be forced to spend more on energy. This effect could also thwart the recently strengthening U.S. economy. Here are ten ways rising oil prices endanger the recovery:

First, it's important to note that none of these ten factors are mutually exclusive. Indeed, many are complementary. It's not likely we would see consumer sentiment fall without the residential real estate market taking a hit, for example. That's why prolonged high oil prices are so dangerous -- they could create a domino effect that would poison many different aspects of the U.S. economy.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

When we are talking about the unemployment rate as a barometer for the health of the economy, it’s most commonly the national figure that gets referenced.

Historically, on a national level, an unemployment rate in the 4-6% range is generally considered “good”, while higher rates that fall within the 8-10% range are “bad”. Higher rates are usually only seen during times of recessions or crisis, when people around the country are struggling to find work.

But, as you’ll see in today’s animated map, unemployment rates at the regional level are a very different thing. Today’s map, which comes to us from FlowingData, shows the disparity of unemployment rates in the U.S. based on county estimates, and how they have their own ebbs and flows.

The Impact of a Crisis

The most noticeable element of the animation is the “spread” of unemployment as a crisis hits.

For reference, here’s the map during 1999 – which is around when income peaked for most Americans.

Now here’s a map of the country during the height of the Financial Crisis in 2009. The “spread” of unemployment catches up to people in even the most economically isolated states.

It goes to show that even people in largely rural counties couldn’t stay isolated from a crisis that originated on Wall Street. While it doesn’t affect them immediately, eventually the “creep” of unemployment hits their counties as well.

One interesting exception to note here is North Dakota. With discoveries in the Bakken, and the fracking boom in full flight at the time, the state recorded the lowest rates of unemployment during the crisis.

Today, while the oil boom has slowed because of a lower price environment, it’s true that unemployment is still relatively low at 2.8% in the state.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Supervolcanoes are volcanic eruptions thousands of times more powerful than normal volcanic eruptions. These types of eruptions cause significant local ecological disturbances and have profound effects on global climate. On the scale of geological time they occur quite frequently.

Volcanologists categorize eruptions by the amount of volcanic ash ejected upon eruption using the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI). The VEI consists of 8 levels, with VEI-8 eruptions considered “supervolcanic eruptions” ejecting 1000 cubic kilometers of ash or more.

Throughout human history our species has encountered one known supervolcanic eruption. This eruption occurred at Lake Toba in Indonesia approximately 74,000 years ago, potentially causing a genetic bottleneck and slowing human expansion into Asia and Australia. However, VEI-7 eruptions (eruptions ejecting 100 cubic kilometers of ash) have occurred with relative regularity (4 in the past 2,000 years).

I recently interviewed University of Texas paleoecologist Dr. Robert Dull to discuss past major eruptions in human history. Dr. Dull studies climate change on millennial scales of time and discovered evidence that a major volcanic eruption occurred around 536 C.E. at Lake Ilopango in modern day El Salvador. He believes that this eruption is responsible for the well-documented extreme global weather events in 536-537 C.E. throughout the northern hemisphere.

I believe that understanding how major eruptions effected human civilization in the past will give us an opportunity to prepare for these eruptions in the future.

Cadell Last: How large was the Lake Ilopango eruption?

Robert Dull: The Lake Ilopango eruption was a magnitude 6.9 eruption. The magnitude scale is more accurate that the VEI. Classifying the eruption as a 6.9 is obviously more precise than labeling it 6 or 7. But it was nearly a VEI-7. However, it wouldn’t take many new data points for that estimate to go up. The more samples we collect the better we will be able to figure out the full volume of the eruption. The magma volume was approximately 39 cubic kilometers.

Cadell Last: Are there estimates on how many people were directly killed as a result of the Ilopango eruption? If so, how were they estimated?

Robert Dull: Between 40,000-80,000 people died during the Lake Ilopango eruption. We used population density assumptions based on settlement patterns in

The Standard & Poor’s 500 index ended essentially flat for the year after the day’s modest losses nudged it into the red for 2015. Even factoring in dividends, the index eked out a far smaller return than in 2014.

The Dow Jones industrial average also closed out the year with a loss. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fared better, delivering a gain for the year.

“It’s a lousy end to a pretty lousy year,” said Edward Campbell, portfolio manager for QMA, a unit of Prudential Investment Management. “A very unrewarding year.”

The Dow ended the day down 178.84 points, or 1.02 percent, to 17,425.03. The S&P 500 index lost 19.42 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,043.94. The Nasdaq composite fell 58.44 points, or 1.2 percent, to 5,007.41.

For 2015, the Dow registered a loss of 2.2 percent. It’s the first down year for the Dow since 2008. The Nasdaq ended with a gain of 5.7 percent.

The S&P 500 index, regarded as a benchmark for the broader stock market, lost 0.7 percent for the year. According to preliminary calculations, the index had a total return for the year of just 1.4 percent, including dividends. That’s the worst return since 2008 and down sharply from the 13.7 percent it returned in 2014.

While U.S. employers added jobs at a solid pace in 2015 and consumer confidence improved, several factors weighed on stocks in 2015. Investors worried about flat earnings growth, a deep slump in oil prices and the impact of the stronger dollar on revenues in markets outside the U.S. They also fretted about the timing of the Federal Reserve’s first interest rate hike in more than a decade.

Crude oil recovered some of its losses from the day before. Benchmark U.S. crude climbed 44 cents to close at $37.04 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 82 cents to close at $37.28 a barrel in London.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

This is more than what the department attached in the decade from 2005.In a written reply to an unstarred question on Friday, minister of state for finance Santosh Kumar Gangwar said that in the last one year, properties worth Rs 11,032.27 crore were attached by the ED after issuing 175 Provisional Attachment Orders (PAO). In comparison, the total value of assets attached from 2005-2015 was Rs 9003.26 crore, statistics on ED website show. In the first three months of the current financial year, Rs 965.84 crore has been attached. The total cumulative attachments would be around Rs 22,000 crore as of June 30 this year, said sources in the department. The figures of properties attached in 2016-17 zoomed due to the Vijay Mallya case, in which properties worth close to Rs 10,000 crore were attached, sources said.More than half of the total searches and a third of the total arrests by the department across the country were effected in the last 15 months, statistics show. Some of these highprofile cases and searches were in Tamil Nadu; for instance the Sekhar Reddy case and Madurai granite mining. The ED is an organisation which goes after big names accused of corruption. The PMLA is a stringent law, where the onus is on the accused to prove that the attached properties are bought from known sources of income, say sources. The ED has been given a free hand to dig up dirty money, said sources. This, they added, reflected in the figures.Sources in the department said that these measures were taken in coordination with other investigative agencies like Income Tax Investigation Wing and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). A task force on shell companies had been created by the ministry of corporate affairs which involves all these departments. The ED is tracking shell companies through which crores of rupees are transferred out of the country. In April, ED sleuths arrested in Chennai a 36-year-old man who had allegedly routed Rs 78 crore through six shell companies.As of July 12, 1.62 lakh shell companies had been struck off the Registrar of Companies (RoC).

Well, the Reserve Bank was looking for hard evidence of a reheating Auckland housing market and it's getting it, in spades.

What the central bank actually intends to do about the problem will be occupying many minds in many places both within and without the RBNZ at the moment.

To me it's looking increasingly likely that the RBNZ will unleash new weaponry either in conjunction with, or maybe just before, its next Financial Stability Report (FSR) on May 13.

My colleague Gareth Vaughan produced this summary earlier in the year of some of the likely options the RBNZ might dip into to slow the housing market. I've got a few more thoughts on this that I'm sharing further down in this article.

But, first, a little background:

In what could be termed his annual scene-setting speech, on February 4, the RBNZ Governor Graeme Wheeler made extensive reference to the housing market, with the slightly, I thought, ominous observation that the central bank would "be talking more about the housing market over the next few months".

Wheeler noted that house price inflation slowed last year as the restrictions on high loan to value lending, introduced by the RBNZ in 2013, coupled with four hikes in official interest rates, helped to constrain demand. But this demand now appeared to be increasing again in Auckland due to rising household incomes, falling interest rates on fixed- rate mortgages, strong migration inflows and continued market tightness.

The RBNZ would have a "clearer assessment" when the February/March Real Estate Institute (REINZ) data was available.

In other words, the RBNZ thought there was a problem, but it wanted to see the smoking gun before firing off its own weapons.

Auckland houses moving

Okay, so we haven't yet seen the REINZ figures for March. But the February ones showed Auckland median prices up 14% on the figures recorded 12 months earlier. More tellingly, the REINZ Stratified Price Index, which adjusts for some of the variations in the mix that can affect the median price, registered an eyebrow-raising 6.4% gain in Auckland over just three months.

As far as March was concerned, the essential thrust of those REINZ figures has been backed up by the latest data both from QV and from Realestate.co.nz.

What is becoming more and more clear - and there are interesting nationwide implications - is the extent to which a heated housing

<|begin_of_text|>Most measuring instruments are limited by the tradeoff between how precisely and how rapidly a measurement is made: the more precise the measurement, the longer it takes. But because many phenomena occurring at the nanoscale are both rapid and tiny, they demand a measuring system that can capture their precise details in both time and space.

Taking up that challenge, researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have redesigned the detection system at the heart of the atomic force microscope (AFM). A premier tool of the nanoworld, the AFM uses a small probe, or tip, to map the submicroscopic hills and valleys that define the surface of materials, along with other properties, at the nanometer scale. Although the AFM has already revolutionized the understanding of nanostructures, scientists are now eager to study nanoscale phenomena, such as the folding of proteins or the diffusion of heat, which happen too quickly and generate changes too small to be accurately measured by existing versions of the microscope.

By fabricating an extremely lightweight AFM probe and combining it with a nanoscale device that converts minuscule deflections of the probe into large changes of an optical signal inside a waveguide, the NIST researchers have broken new ground: Their AFM system measures rapid changes in structure with high precision.

Illustration of a newly fabricated atomic force microscope (AFM) probe integrated with an optical, disk-shaped resonator. Combined with a technique called photothermal induced resonance (PTIR), which uses infrared light to examine a material’s composition, the incorporation of the resonator enables the probe to make high-precision measurements of minuscule, rapid changes in a material. Credit: NIST

The achievement takes the AFM into a new realm, enabling the instrument to measure time-varying nanoscale processes that may change as quickly as ten billionths of a second. “This is truly a transformational advance,” said NIST scientist Andrea Centrone.

Centrone, Vladimir Aksyuk, and their colleagues employed the new AFM capabilities in experiments using photothermal induced resonance (PTIR), a technique that combines the acuity of an AFM with the ability to determine the composition of materials using infrared light.

With the new AFM-PTIR system, the scientists measured with high precision the rapid, but minute expansion of individual microcrystals heated by a light pulse. The microcrystals examined by the team belong to a class of materials known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). These materials contain

<|begin_of_text|>"We cut our deficits by more than half."

In 2012, PolitiFact twice rated True claims that President Barack Obama failed to keep a promise to cut federal deficits in half by the end of his first term.

At that point, the budget gap topped a trillion bucks and Republican congressmen called out Obama because the deficit had been reduced by just 15 percent.

But there was the president at Laborfest 2014 in Milwaukee proclaiming "we cut our deficits by more than half."

In his Sept. 1, 2014 speech, the president ticked off for union supporters a list of major policy decisions he contends helped boost the economy and improve the government’s bottom line.

We can’t cover all of those here, but the deficit claim grabbed our attention.

Has it really been cut in half?

The White House Office of Management and Budget pointed us to a chart prepared by that office in 2013 as proof of Obama's claim.

It compares the yearly deficits under Obama, expressed -- as they often are -- as a share of the nation’s entire economy, which is measured by the Gross Domestic Product.

At the start of Obama’s term, the chart showed, the figure was 9.2 percent. The latest figure was 4.1 percent.

That appears to back Obama's statement.

But let's examine this in detail.

To do that, we reviewed figures published by the Congressional Budget Office as well as the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. We also consulted with independent fiscal experts.

The baseline year for comparison is fiscal year 2009, which ended Sept. 30 of that year. This was the last budget from President George W. Bush, as Obama took office in January of that year.

The most recent complete fiscal year is 2013.

Those are the same years Obama's chart showed.

Our analysis showed the drop easily topped 50 percent, and was actually somewhat higher than Obama's chart would indicate.

As a share of the economy, we found -- and our experts confirmed -- the drop was from 9.8 percent in 2009 to 4.1 percent in 2013.

Obama’s chart actually reflects a lower deficit figure for 2009, and therefore a lower share of GDP, 9.2%.

That’s because instead of using the actual 2009 deficit of $1.4 trillion, Obama lowers it by the $200 billion in increased deficit spending that he -- not Bush -- pushed through in the stimulus plan to address the crisis that became the

<|begin_of_text|>In every single region of the world, economic growth has failed to return to the rate it averaged before the Great Recession. Economists have come up with a variety of theories for why this recovery has been the weakest in postwar history, including high indebtedness, growing income inequality, and excess caution induced by the original debt crisis. Although each explanation has some merit, experts have largely overlooked what may be the most important factor: the global slowdown in the growth of the labor force.

One way to calculate the world’s potential growth rate is to add the rate at which the labor force is expanding to the rate at which productivity is rising. Since 1960, gains in both factors have contributed equally to potential economic growth. And in the last decade, the gains in both appear to have leveled off. The difference between these two drivers, however, is that there is a debate about whether the decline in productivity growth is real. Productivity measurements have arguably failed to capture savings in money and time generated by new technologies, from superfast Internet connections to artificial intelligence. But it is hard to deny that the growth in the size of the labor force—which is driven mainly by increases in the number of working-age people, those between the ages of 15 and 64—has slowed across the world.

In a world with fewer young people, economic growth will be harder to come by.

Between 1960 and 2005, the global labor force grew at an average of 1.8 percent per year, but since 2005, the rate has downshifted to just 1.1 percent, and it will likely slip further in the coming decades as fertility rates continue to decline in most parts of the world. The labor force is still growing rapidly in Nigeria, the Philippines, and a few other countries. But it is growing very slowly in the United States—at 0.5 percent per year over the past decade, compared with 1.7 percent from 1960 to 2005—and is already shrinking in some countries, such<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Other scales define a cobble's size in slightly different terms. A rock made predominantly of cobbles is termed a conglomerate. Cobblestone is a building material based on cobbles.

Etymology [ edit ]

Cobbles, also called cobblestones, derive their name from the word cob, meaning a rounded lump. The term is further related to the German Kopf, meaning head.[1] Chester Wentworth referred to cobbles as cobble bowlders [sic] in his 1922 paper that would become the basis for the Udden–Wentworth scale.[2]

Classifications [ edit ]

Sandy conglomerate with cobbles in the Hazeva Formation (Miocene) of southern Israel

Within the widely used Krumbein phi scale of grain sizes, cobbles are defined as clasts of rock ranging from −6 to −8 φ. This classification corresponds with the Udden–Wentworth size scale which defines cobbles as clasts with diameters from 64–256 millimeters (2.5–10.1 in). On this scale, cobbles are larger than pebbles which measure 4–64 millimeters (0.16–2.52 in) in diameter and smaller than boulders, whose diameters range from 256–4,096 millimeters (10.1–161.3 in). On the Udden–Wentworth scale, an unlithified fraction of cobbles is classified as gravel while a lithified sample primarily composed of cobbles is a conglomerate.[2] The Committee on Sedimentation of the US National Research Council has recommended that in situ cobbles be identified by their process of origination, if possible (e.g. cobbles by disintegration, by exfoliation, etc.).

In the late 1800s and early to mid-1900s, prior to the Udden–Wentworth scale's widespread adoption, size classifications tended to group all particles larger than 2 millimeters (0.079 in) together as gravel or stones. Other scales have defined the size of a cobble slightly differently than the Udden–Went

What does it mean to be “Third World” in 2013? If we are to take the traditional definition of the term, then “Third World” refers to those (non-white) countries that struggle to attain high levels of economic development and which, for the most part, are reduced to the periphery of the global economy. However, since the onset of the economic crisis beginning in 2007-2008, many of the economic problems of those traditionally poor countries have become ever more apparent in the so-called developed world. Socio-economic maladies such as extreme poverty, hunger, and unemployment have skyrocketed in advanced capitalist countries like the United States, while politicians and the media continue to trumpet the mirage of an economic recovery. Naturally, one must ask for whom this is a recovery…for the poor or for Wall St? Moreover, it has forced the world to examine what progress looks like. One way of doing so is to analyze what the statistics tell us about the United States versus Venezuela. In so doing, one begins to get a much clearer picture, free from the distortions of media and politicians alike, of just how much progress has been made in the Bolivarian Revolution while the situation of the poor and working classes in the US continues to deteriorate.

What Is Poverty?

Before one can reach any definitive conclusions about poverty in the US and Venezuela, it is essential to first establish the stark difference in the way in which poverty is measured in the two countries. With respect to the US, poverty is measured purely by household income, with a certain threshold known as the “poverty line” determined by the Census Bureau. This measurement, based on a purely arbitrary delineation between poverty and “non-poverty”, is the one by which many make determinations about the state of the poor in the US. As should be self-evident, this system of analyzing poverty ignores the obvious fact that there is little tangible difference between the lives of those slightly over and slightly under the poverty line in that both live in a constant state of privation. Moreover, as increasing inflation, decreasing wages and other factors continue to impact the purchasing power and actual lives of the poor, the poverty line becomes even more problematic.

In contrast, the Venezuelan government has a distinctly different set of measurements to determine true poverty including: access to education, access to clean drinking water, access to adequate housing, and other factors.i Essentially then, in Venezuela, poverty is not a measure of income, but of quality of life.

In this paper, the contribution of pathogens to seasonality of ILI consultations was statistically modelled. Virological count data were first smoothed using modulation models for seasonal time series. Second, Poisson regression was used regressing ILI consultation counts on the smoothed time series. Using ratios of the estimated regression parameters, relative measures of the underreporting of pathogens were obtained. Influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) significantly contributed to explain the seasonal variation in ILI consultations. We also found that RSV was the least and influenza virus A is the most underreported pathogen in Belgian laboratory surveillance. The proposed methods and results are helpful in interpreting the data of clinical and laboratory surveillance, which are the essential parts of influenza surveillance.

In this study, the pathogens’ contribution to seasonal variation in ILI was statistically modelled, using data from two independent surveillance systems in Belgium. Data from both clinical sentinel surveillance [ 17 ], and laboratory sentinel surveillance were used in monitoring trends of different respiratory pathogens [ 18 ]. The pathogens’ contribution to the seasonality of ILI was estimated using smooth modulation models for seasonal time series [ 19 ] and Poisson models regressing the number of ILI consultations in the number of laboratory reports for various respiratory pathogens. Epidemiological interpretations in terms of relative measures of underreported pathogens were obtained by using ratios of estimated Poisson regression parameters.

Respiratory pathogens other than influenza are generally not monitored by combined influenza surveillance [ 5, 6 ]. However, such pathogens might also cause ILI, resulting in poor to moderate positive predictive values of ILI diagnoses of laboratory-confirmed influenza infections [ 10 – 12 ]. In particular, along with influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae are regarded as other important respiratory pathogens with the potential to cause ILI. For most of these respiratory pathogens seasonality has been consistently observed, although the driving mechanisms are still poorly understood [ 13 ]. A typical example of a seasonal infectious disease is influenza. Annual influenza epidemics commonly occur during the winter season in temperate regions of the world with varying onset, duration and severity [ 14 ].

<|begin_of_text|>The brain - awake and sleeping - is awash in electrical activity, and not just from the individual pings of single neurons communicating with each other. In fact, the brain is enveloped in countless overlapping electric fields, generated by the neural circuits of scores of communicating neurons. The fields were once thought to be an "epiphenomenon, a 'bug' of sorts, occurring during neural communication," says neuroscientist Costas Anastassiou, a postdoctoral scholar in biology at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).

New work by Anastassiou and his colleagues, however, suggests that the fields do much more - and that they may, in fact, represent an additional form of neural communication.

"In other words," says Anastassiou, the lead author of a paper about the work appearing in the journal Nature Neuroscience, "while active neurons give rise to extracellular fields, the same fields feed back to the neurons and alter their behavior," even though the neurons are not physically connected - a phenomenon known as ephaptic coupling. "So far, neural communication has been thought to occur at localized machines, termed synapses. Our work suggests an additional means of neural communication through the extracellular space independent of synapses."

Extracellular electric fields exist throughout the living brain, though they are particularly strong and robustly repetitive in specific brain regions such as the hippocampus, which is involved in memory formation, and the neocortex, the area where long-term memories are held. "The perpetual fluctuations of these extracellular fields are the hallmark of the living and behaving brain in all organisms, and their absence is a strong indicator of a deeply comatose, or even dead, brain," Anastassiou explains.

Previously, neurobiologists assumed that the fields were capable of affecting - and even controlling - neural activity only during severe pathological conditions such as epileptic seizures, which induce very strong fields. Few studies, however, had actually assessed the impact of far weaker - but very common - non-epileptic fields. "The reason is simple," Anastassiou says. "It is very hard to conduct an in vivo experiment in the absence of extracellular fields," to observe what changes when the fields are not around.

To tease out those effects, Anastassiou and his colleagues, including Caltech neuroscientist Christof Koch, the Lois and Victor Troendle Professor of Cognitive and Behavioral Biology and professor of computation and neural systems, focused on strong but slowly oscillating fields, called local field potentials (L

<|begin_of_text|>Originally, the term “movies” did not mean films, but the people who made them. It was generally used with disdain by early Hollywood locals who disliked the “invading” Easterners. [1]

The first film ever made in Hollywood was D.W. Griffith’s 1910 In Old California, a biograph melodrama about a Spanish maiden (Marion Leonard) who has an illegitimate son with a man who later becomes governor of California. It was shot in two days. [6]

When Horace and Daeida Wilcox founded Hollywood in 1887, they hoped it would become a religious community. Prohibitionists, they banned liquor from the town and offered free land to anyone willing to build a church. [25]

The most filmed author is William Shakespeare, including straight film versions, modern adaptations, ( West Side Story [1961], The Lion King [1994], etc.) and Shakespeare parodies. [1]

The shortest dialogue script since the introduction of talkies was written for Mel Brook’s Silent Movie (1976), which has only one spoken word throughout: “Non.” [1]

The first motion picture to depict a non-pornographic sex act was Extase (1933) starring Hedwig Kiesler, known later as Hedy Lamarr (1913-2000). Her character flees from an impotent husband, runs naked through the woods, bathes, and then has sex with a young engineer in a hut.l [17]

Though photos have survived, the movie A Daughter of the Gods is now considered lost

The first nude scene in a major motion picture was of swimmer and actress Annette Kellerman (1887-1975) in A Daughter of the Gods (1916). [17]

The earliest known American pornographic film is the 1915 A Free Ride, a.k.a. A Grass Sandwich. The film was directed by “A. Wise Guy” and was written by “Will She.” [17]

The Western Hero most portrayed on screen has been William Frederick Cody, a.k.a. Buffalo Bill, followed by William Bonny, a.k.a. Billy the Kid. [17]

The first African-American to play a leading role in a feature film was Sam Lucas (1850-1916) who was cast in the title role of Uncle Tom’s Cabin (1914). The first African-American actor to make a career in films was Noble Johnson (1881-1978). [17]

<|begin_of_text|>The great bulk of the economic commentary you read in the papers is focused on the short run: the effects of the “fiscal cliff” on U.S. recovery, the stresses on the euro, Japan ’s latest attempt to break out of deflation. This focus is understandable, since one global depression can ruin your whole day. But our current travails will eventually end. What do we know about the prospects for long-run prosperity?

The answer is: less than we think.

The long-term projections produced by official agencies, like the Congressional Budget Office, generally make two big assumptions. One is that economic growth over the next few decades will resemble growth over the past few decades. In particular, productivity — the key driver of growth — is projected to rise at a rate not too different from its average growth since the 1970s. On the other side, however, these projections generally assume that income inequality, which soared over the past three decades, will increase only modestly looking forward.

It’s not hard to understand why agencies make these assumptions. Given how little we know about long-run growth, simply assuming that the future will resemble the past is a natural guess. On the other hand, if income inequality continues to soar, we’re looking at a dystopian, class-warfare future — not the kind of thing government agencies want to contemplate.

Yet this conventional wisdom is very likely to be wrong on one or both dimensions.

Recently, Robert Gordon of Northwestern University created a stir by arguing that economic growth is likely to slow sharply — indeed, that the age of growth that began in the 18th century may well be drawing to an end.

Mr. Gordon points out that long-term economic growth hasn’t been a steady process; it has been driven by several discrete “industrial revolutions,” each based on a particular set of technologies. The first industrial revolution, based largely on the steam engine, drove growth in the late-18th and early-19th centuries. The second, made possible, in large part, by the application of science to technologies such as electrification, internal combustion and chemical engineering, began circa 1870 and drove growth into the 1960s. The third, centered around information technology, defines our current era.

And, as Mr. Gordon correctly notes, the payoffs so far to the third industrial revolution, while real, have been far smaller than those to the second. Electrification, for example, was a much bigger deal than the Internet.

<|begin_of_text|>Wow, did you see the new jobs numbers? Unemployment is down to 5.1%. In the current definition of full employment (during the 1960’s it was a 4% unemployment rate) we are getting near that point. In fact, the unemployment rate is now lower than it was anytime during the Reagan presidency. We have had 67 consecutive months of job growth. The unemployment rate has dropped almost 5% from the high point of the Obama administration in October 2009. With all this good news why are things so bad?

You may have heard something about a controversy regarding the unemployment numbers. There is focus on such matters as underemployment which for example having someone with a college degree waiting tables or bartending for lack of any quality opportunities for a person with their educational qualifications. Or you may have heard about the many people working part-time jobs due to lack of full-time opportunities or employers attempting to circumvent the rules established by Obamacare which states that a full-time employee reaches that status at 30 hours per week.

What we really need to spotlight is the crushing economic effect of a lower labor participation rate (LPR). There are now 100 million Americans over the age of 16 that are not working. The Obama Administration keeps running out the deceit that this is because of all the baby boomers retiring. The fact is that the labor force participation rate for the age group 16 to 24 is only 55.1%. That is a reduction of over 10% from 66% during the 1990’s. It is also down over 5% (60.8%) from 2005. Sure myopic minimum wage increases are harming the employment of this age group with the least work experience, but that is not the total explanation.

The Obama manipulation gets worse because the LPR is lower for the prime working years of 25-54 years old. In 2000 the LPR for this age group was almost 85%. It was down to 83% when the recession started, but has now plummeted to 80.7%. It is clear the baby boomers are not the only source of reduction in the LPR.

You may wonder why this is such a big deal. The LPR for September 2015 was 62.4%. That is 3.7% less than August, 2005 exactly ten years earlier. One can argue this reduction in rate has to do with the “Great Recession.” Not true. If you review the

<|begin_of_text|>The platinum coin died yesterday, the casualty of a Treasury Department statement that says that—among other things—the Federal Reserve views the platinum tactic as illegitimate.

In operational terms, that’s the ballgame. If the Fed won’t play ball then it doesn’t really work. An administration determined to finance the government via platinum coin seigniorage over the objections of the Federal Reserve Board could probably find a way to do it, but a high-profile fight with the Fed would drastically undermine any market reassuring properties of this means of avoiding default.

A lot of the ensuing discussion has focused on political tactics. Some feel that by ruling out the coin, the administration has weakened its bargaining position. Administration officials argue, persuasively, that this is backwards. Platinum would have given an out to Republicans. Obama had two choices, one was to cut spending and the other was to resort to this goofy seeming gimmick. He went for gimmickry because that’s how determined he is to spend spend spend. With no alternatives on the table, Obama has the upper-hand in a high-stakes game of chicken. That said, the platinum coin was never about giving Obama a stronger tactical political position. Even if platinum worked extremely well, there would just be a March fight with congressional Republicans over the appropriations bills. The idea of the platinum coin was to avoid a high-stakes game of chicken whose mere existence is bad for America and the world.

That’s now not going to happen.

All that said, I’m glad we had this conversation. Direct discussion of the platinum coin was a good reminder that many people, including influential media figures, appear to have no idea what money is or how the monetary system works. Apart from the shockingly widespread view that the value of coins is determined by their metallic content, there was a lot of insistence that creating money was somehow an act of “magic.” In fact, the way all legal currency is created is that a government agency creates the money. Typically that’s the Federal Reserve accommodating bank demand for base money. But all kinds of things can happen. Forget “Quantitative Easing.” When the Fed does the thing that reporters call “raising interest rates” it doesn’t pull an interest rate lever. It sells bonds on the open market in exchange for money. And when that money enters the Fed, it vanishes. When they “lower interest rates” they buy bonds on the open market in exchange for money. Where do they get the money? From nowhere. They just make it. That’s money. Whether the
