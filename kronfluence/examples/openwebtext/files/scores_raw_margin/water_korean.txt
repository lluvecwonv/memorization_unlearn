가수 고 김광석씨 부인 서해순씨가 지난 17일 용인시 기흥구 자신의 집에서 〈한겨레〉기자와 만나 인터뷰를 하고 있다.

가수 고 김광석씨의 부인 서해순씨를 둘러싼 ‘김광석씨 딸 서연양 타살 의혹’에 대해 경찰이 지난 10일 무혐의 결론을 내렸지만 여전히 많은 사람은 그에 대한 의심을 거두지 못하고 있다. 서씨는 경찰의 수사 결과 발표가 있고 일주일이 지난 17일 오전 경기 용인시 자신의 집에서 <한겨레>와 만나 2시간 동안 그간의 소회를 밝혔다.

이날 서씨는 장애가 있는 아이를 키워왔던 자신의 삶에 대해 ‘이를 악물고 견뎌낸 시간’으로 기억했다. 자신이 무너지면 딸 서연양과 함께 죽을 수밖에 없는 심정이었다는 것이다. 서씨는 이날 서연양의 평소 사진과 일기장 등을 공개하며, “서연이는 사람을 행복하게 만들어 주는 아이”였다고 회상했다. 그는 경찰 조사 과정에 서연양의 ‘현장검증’까지 치른 일을 회상하며 “이렇게까지 살아야 하나 싶었다”며 괴로움을 토로하기도 했다.

그는 이번 사태가 여성 혐오에서 비롯됐다는 박훈 변호사의 의견에 동의를 표하기도 했다. 서씨는 “남편이 죽으면 혼자된 여자에게 ‘모든 권리를 놓고 갈길 가라’고 말하는 차별적 문화”가 이 사태를 키웠다고 말했다.

서씨는 ‘끝까지 취재하겠다’는 이상호 <고발뉴스> 기자 때문에 신변의 위협을 느낀다며 경찰에 신변보호 요청을 했다고 밝혔다. 법원에는 접근금지 가처분도 신청할 계획이란다. 또 안민석 더불어민주당 의원, 추혜선 정의당 의원 등이 ‘변사사건의 공소시효를 확대하자’며 발의한 형사소송법 개정안(‘김광석법’)에 대한 불만을 드러내기도

<|begin_of_text|>A few days ago, I wrote about one of the dumbest supposedly major controversies in a while, which was one SEVENTEEN member supposedly telling a fan that she was basically his source of income and two others saying that she was a fan of another member. I figured that would be sorta it (because I am a dumbass) since it was either: 1) Fabricated 2) A joke 3) Telling the truth. However, of course things started to snowball because the accusation had to do with disrespect from an idol to a fan.

SEVENTEEN fans ended up claiming it was fabricated because Seungkwan‘s signature looks different, but as far as I’m concerned there was nothing conclusive about that. Of course, the same applies to the accuser’s clarifications, which don’t actually prove anything either, yet people are taking her story as solid evidence for whatever reason.

As far as I see it, we’re thus basically back to the battle of narratives. Yet the reason I’m skeptical of her side of the story is that there was a recording she made with Jeonghan that was supposed to make him some kind of dickhead.

Fansite recording of Junghan

Fan: Today’s dress code…

Junghan: Stop coming here.

Fan: (2 seconds pause) Huh…? OK.. But I keep getting picked though.

Junghan: Then other fans can’t come. Stop coming.

What an asshole, right?

But the reality of that exchange was basically what I thought the Seungkwan incident was all about, which was idols joking around with fans who show up all the time.

Everybody can have their own interpretation of that exchange, but I definitely see it as two people who recognize each other shooting the shit and not some malicious attack. And once that tone is established between them, it’s harder for me to believe Seungkwan wasn’t joking around

福島の子供たちが死んでいく

Some 39 months after the multiple explosions at Fukushima, thyroid cancer rates among nearby children have skyrocketed to more than forty times (40x) normal.

福島第一原発の複数の原子炉爆発事故から３９ヶ月。周辺地域の子供たちの甲状腺がんの発生率が通常の４０倍に急上昇している。

More than 48 percent of some 375,000 young people-nearly 200,000 kids-tested by the Fukushima Medical University near the smoldering reactors now suffer from pre-cancerous thyroid abnormalities, primarily nodules and cysts. The rate is accelerating.

福島県立医科大学がおこなった調査によると、約２０万人の子供たちを含む３７万５千人の若い対象者のうち４８％以上が前がん症状の結節や嚢胞が発症し、その率はさらに増加している。

More than 120 childhood cancers have been indicated where just three would be expected, says Joseph Mangano, executive director of the Radiation and Public Health Project.

通常は3種ほどの小児がんが予想されるはずが、120種以上の小児がんが示されている、と『放射能と公衆衛生プロジェクト』の主任管理官、ジョセフ・マンガーノ氏は述べている。

The nuclear industry and its apologists continue to deny this public health tragedy. Some have actually asserted that "not one person" has been affected by Fukushima's massive radiation releases, which for some isotopes exceed Hiroshima by a factor of nearly 30.

原子力産業とその擁護者たちは、この公衆衛生上の悲劇を否定し続けている。広島原爆で放出された放射性同位元素量の３０倍を超える、福島原発からの大量の放射能放出で傷害を受けたものは「一人もいない」と断言する関係者も存在する。

But the deadly epidemic at Fukushima is consistent with impacts suffered among children near the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island and the 1986 explosion at Chernobyl, as well as findings at other commercial reactors.

Translation: The blame should not be on the father of the person who gives up his Korean citizenship to evade military service. But if that person's father claims to be patriotic and if it is a country that loudly tells others' sons to be patriotic, then the road that country is on is fixed. A spoiled road.

Composition of Rocks A rock can be defined as a solid substance that occurs naturally because of the effects of three basic geological processes: magma solidification; sedimentation of weathered rock debris; and metamorphism. As a result of these processes, three main types of rock occur: Igneous Rocks - produced by solidification of molten magma from the mantle. Magma that solidifies at the Earth's surface conceives extrusive or volcanic igneous rocks. When magma cools and solidifies beneath the surface of the Earth intrusive or plutonic igneous rocks are formed. Sedimentary Rocks - formed by burial, compression, and chemical modification of deposited weathered rock debris or sediments at the Earth's surface. Metamorphic Rocks - created when existing rock is chemically or physically modified by intense heat or pressure. rocks are composed of minerals. Minerals are defined by geologists as naturally occurring inorganic solids that have a crystalline structure and a distinct chemical composition. Of course, the minerals found in the Earth's rocks are produced by a variety of different arrangements of chemical elements. A list of the eight most common elements making up the minerals found in the Earth's rocks is described in Table 10d-1.

A new analysis of the largest known deposit of carbonate minerals on Mars suggests that the original Martian atmosphere may have already lost most of its carbon dioxide by the era of valley network formation.

"The biggest carbonate deposit on Mars has, at most, twice as much carbon in it as the current Mars atmosphere," said Bethany Ehlmann of the California Institute of Technology and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, both in Pasadena. "Even if you combined all known carbon reservoirs together, it is still nowhere near enough to sequester the thick atmosphere that has been proposed for the time when there were rivers flowing on the Martian surface."

Carbon dioxide makes up most of the Martian atmosphere. That gas can be pulled out of the air and sequestered or pulled into the ground by chemical reactions with rocks to form carbonate minerals. Years before the series of successful Mars missions, many scientists expected to find large Martian deposits of carbonates holding much of the carbon from the planet's original atmosphere. Instead, these missions have found low concentrations of carbonate distributed widely, and only a few concentrated deposits. By far the largest known carbonate-rich deposit on Mars covers an area at least the size of Delaware, and maybe as large as Arizona, in a region called Nili Fossae.

Christopher Edwards, a former Caltech researcher now with the U.S. Geological Survey in Flagstaff, Arizona, and Ehlmann reported the findings and analysis in a paper posted online by the journal Geology. Their estimate of how much carbon is locked into the Nili Fossae carbonate deposit uses observations from numerous Mars missions, including the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) on NASA's Mars Global Surveyor orbiter, the mineral-mapping Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) and two telescopic cameras on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) on NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter.

Edwards and Ehlmann compare their tally of sequestered carbon at Nili Fossae to what would be needed to account for an early Mars atmosphere dense enough to sustain surface waters during the period when flowing rivers left their mark by cutting extensive river-valley networks. By their estimate, it would require more than 35 carbonate deposits the size of the one examined at Nili Fossae. They deem it unlikely that so many large deposits have been overlooked

The term is Japanese slang for companies with long hours, dreadful working conditions and miserable pay that exploit their employees beyond the legal limit — last-ditch options for those who can't get better work. The company in the movie, though, was not the kind you might associate with such a backward, sweatshop-like workplace. It was an IT company.

Not surprisingly, young Japanese are none too keen [2] to work in such coding sweatshops, which are all too real (the movie itself is based on a true story [3], and a not uncommon one). It doesn't help that programmers are associated in the public eye with social ineptness [4], and that the programming task itself is often viewed as grunt work, or not understood at all [5] [ja]. Young Japanese are steadily fleeing the industry, and the exodus is one of the main reasons why Japan is losing its competitiveness in the new digital age [6].

A personal perspective

37-year-old software architect Ryo Asai [7] (@ryoasai74 [8]) and his blog “Becoming a Master Programmer [9]” (達人プログラマーを目指して) [jp] offer a rare counterpoint to this gloomy picture, and a unique window onto the state of the IT industry in Japan. In his profile, the blogger explains:

Duvalia jp name デュバリア Biological information Based: Majini Development information Date of

creation: 2009 Created via: Type 3 Plagas Purpose: Experimental

Duvalia is a stage in the life of the Type 3 Plaga, a genetically modified species of Plaga engineered by Tricell. Its name is derived from the Duvalia, a species of carrion flower found in tropical Africa. Its most recognizable feature is a large bulb found inside five shorter appendages, which the Plaga mimics with its armored shell and vulnerable core.[1][excerpt 1]

History

The Type 3 Plagas were being experimented on in humans from Summer 2008, with research taking place on the Ndipaya tribesmen who became known as Marshland Majini. By 2009 the guards working on Excella Gionne's cargo ship were also implanted with this Plaga type.

Overall, Duvalia are more commonly seen in Base Majini.

On the heels of a successful close flyby of Saturn's moon Enceladus, NASA's Cassini spacecraft is returning images of Enceladus and the nearby moon Dione.

Several pictures show Enceladus backlit, with the dark outline of the moon crowned by glowing jets from the south polar region. The images show several separate jets, or sets of jets, emanating from the fissures known as "tiger stripes." Scientists will use the images to pinpoint the jet source locations on the surface and learn more about their shape and variability.

The Enceladus flyby took Cassini within about 48 kilometers (30 miles) of the moon's northern hemisphere. Cassini's fields and particles instruments worked on searching for particles that may form a tenuous atmosphere around Enceladus. They also hope to learn whether those particles may be similar to the faint oxygen- and carbon-dioxide atmosphere detected recently around Rhea, another Saturnian moon. The scientists were particularly interested in the Enceladus environment away from the jets emanating from the south polar region. Scientists also hope this flyby will help them understand the rate of micrometeoroid bombardment in the Saturn system and get at the age of Saturn's main rings.

This flyby of Enceladus, the 13th in Cassini's mission, took a similar path to the last Enceladus flyby on Nov. 30. About eight hours before the Enceladus flyby, Cassini also swung past Dione at a distance of about 100,000 kilometers (62,000 miles). During that flyby, the spacecraft snapped clear, intriguing images of the bright, fractured region known as the "wispy terrain." These features are tectonic ridges and faults formed by geologic activity on the moon sometime in the past. Scientists will now be able to measure the depth and extent of them more accurately.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C.

18O is a rare isotope of oxygen. The ratio of 18O to the normal 16O in foraminifera fossils (“forams”) can be used to estimate paleo-ocean temperatures. Higher values mean lower temperatures. A recent article on geologypage.com (here) led me to Bernard, et al., 2017, which has experimental data that suggest 18O concentrations can be altered in fossils by solid-state diffusion after fossilization. This can corrupt the measurement and the resulting calculated temperature. According to Bernard and colleagues, the 18O concentration alteration is visually imperceptible, so one cannot tell the fossil has been altered by visual inspection. If their results are valid, how will this impact our view of climate history?

Fractionation of 18O and 16O takes place during evaporation and precipitation, so another problem for this paleothermometer is glacier and polar ice, which delay the return of excess 16O in water vapor to the ocean. Correlations of δ18O to temperature are for an ice-free Earth, the formation of polar ice caps and mountain glaciers have an additional effect on δ18O. In figure 1, the δ18O record and the δ13C record are shown for the Cenozoic (65 million years ago to the present day).

Figure 1 (source: Zachos, et al., 2001)

The red temperature scale at the bottom of figure 1 is only applicable when there is no significant permanent polar ice, Zachos, et al. call this the ice-free temperature. It is applicable prior to about 33 million years ago when Antarctica and the North Pole were ice-free, at least in their respective summer months. Once permanent ice caps appear, they remove 16O from the oceans indefinitely and lead to a large positive δ18O in the oceans and in forams. Both records shown in figure 1 are for global deep-sea pelagic fossils, water depths greater than 1,000 meters.

In the experiments, Bernard, et al. exposed foraminifera tests (shells) to elevated pressures and temperatures when submersed in pure H 2 18O. The forams were then monitored with a micro-mass spectrometer and they observed oxygen-isotope changes. They then attempted to model the isotope diffusion process during sediment burial. Their models suggest that on a time scale of tens of millions of years, the isotopic diffusion could cause ice-free δ18

<|begin_of_text|>Perchloric acid is a mineral acid with the formula HClO 4. Usually found as an aqueous solution, this colorless compound is a stronger acid than sulfuric acid and nitric acid. It is a powerful oxidizer when hot, but aqueous solutions up to approximately 70% by weight at room temperature are generally safe, only showing strong acid features and no oxidizing properties. Perchloric acid is useful for preparing perchlorate salts, especially ammonium perchlorate, an important rocket fuel component. Perchloric acid is dangerously corrosive and readily forms potentially explosive mixtures.

Production [ edit ]

Perchloric acid is produced industrially by two routes. The traditional method exploits the high aqueous solubility of sodium perchlorate (209 g/100 mL of water at room temperature). Treatment of such solutions with hydrochloric acid gives perchloric acid, precipitating solid sodium chloride:

NaClO 4 + HCl → NaCl + HClO 4

The concentrated acid can be purified by distillation. The alternative route, which is more direct and avoids salts, entails anodic oxidation of aqueous chlorine at a platinum electrode.[5][6]

Laboratory preparations [ edit ]

Treatment of barium perchlorate with sulfuric acid precipitates barium sulfate, leaving perchloric acid. It can also be made by mixing nitric acid with ammonium perchlorate and boiling while adding hydrochloric acid. The reaction gives nitrous oxide and perchloric acid due to a concurrent reaction involving the ammonium ion and can be concentrated and purified significantly by boiling off the remaining nitric and hydrochloric acids.

Properties [ edit ]

Anhydrous perchloric acid is an unstable oily liquid at room temperature. It forms at least five hydrates, several of which have been characterized crystallographically. These solids consist of the perchlorate anion linked via hydrogen bonds to H 2 O and H 3 O+ centers[7] Perchloric acid forms an azeotrope with water, consisting of about 72.5% perchloric acid. This form of the acid is stable indefinitely and is commercially available. Such solutions are hygroscopic. Thus, if left open to the air, concentrated perchloric acid dilutes itself by absorbing water from the air.

Dehydration of perchloric acid gives the anhydride dichlorine heptoxide:[8]

<|begin_of_text|>The Korean language contains many words that are based on onomatopoeia, which is the sound associated with an object or action. The Korean word for onomatopoeia is heeseongeo ( 의성어), but don't worry about remembering it... it's rarely used. In fact, if you use the word with Koreans, then they might assume that you are talking about some kind of fish! So let's take a closer look at a few of them.

Note: This article contains Hangul (Korean letters). If you can't read Korean yet, download a free guide here to start reading in about 60 minutes!! 의성어),

Learning the onomatopoeic Korean words might sound like an easy way to improve your Korean ability, but it's not as easy as it might seem. This is because the sounds that Koreans associate with something can be very different from the sounds that English speakers associate with the same object or action.

Take animals, for instance. What sound does a dog make? In English, people might say "woof, woof" but in Korean, " 멍멍 (meong-meong)." Clearly these are very different. Cats, in English, go "meow, meow"; in Korean, " 야옹 (ya-ong)." Korean pigs sound, " 꿀꿀꿀 (ggul-ggul-ggul)" whereas in English, "oink-oink." Ducks in Korea go " 곽곽 (quack-quack)", and in English... well, actually that one happens to be the same.

In some cases, the Korean name of certain animals is based on the sound that they make, which makes it easier for learners of Korean to remember the names of such animals. Frogs in Korean are called 개구리 (gaeguri) and the sound that they make is " 개굴개굴 (gaegul-gaegul)" while owls are called 부엉이 (bu-ong-i) and make a " 부엉부엉 (bu-ong-bu-ong)" sound when they hoot. 개구리개굴개굴부엉이부엉부엉

(koo-koo) – the sound of a pigeon 구구

(ummeh) – the sound of a cow or sheep 음메

<|begin_of_text|>The SnO 2 /GS Foam was fabricated by a chemical self-assembly strategy and a subsequent freeze-drying process (Fig. 1). At step 1, from the collochemistry, the metal oxide such as Fe 2 O 3, TiO 2 and SnO 2 colloid was positively charged; the GO was negatively charged because GO has many oxygen containing functional groups on the surface35. The GO and SnO 2 nanoparticles were attracted by the electrostatic force so that the SnO 2 nanoparticles can distribute on the surface of GO and not departure by the ultrasonication and stir. At step 2, L-ascorbyl acid was used to reduce oxygen containing functional groups (e.g. carboxyl) on the surface GO, producing in situ reduced GO (rGO). rGO has smaller solubility in water than GO because the reduction of polar oxygen containing functional groups makes GO less hydrophilic. So, as GO sheet began to turn into the rGO, the delocalized π-bond’s conjugative effect would be increased and enlarged. The freshly formed rGO sheets would stack on other rGO sheets as a result of the π–π stacking interactions and self-assembled into a 3D structure. After the chemical reaction and at step 3, there are still many oxygen containing functional groups left on rGO sheets, thus, the SnO 2 nanoparticles with polar surfaces would interact with those functional groups via hydrogen bonding. By annealing at 550 °C, the hydrogen bonds may turn into oxygen bridges between SnO 2 and rGO, forming Sn-O-C bonds. Therefore, the SnO 2 nanoparticles are anchored strongly on the graphene surface through a C-O-Sn bridge, which facilitates the electron transfer and improve the electrode stability. Finally, we obtain a porous ASGF with relative density of ~19 mg cm−3.

Typical SEM images in Fig. 2A,B show that ASGF possess a 3D structure with interconnected pores ranging from several nanometers to several micrometers.

<|begin_of_text|>One of the oldest questions on earth is how all this crazy life started. Where did you come from? How about your office plant, or your cat? For a long time, our only working idea was that gods from the heavens had provided the seed of life. We may, at least, have been looking into the correct direction: researchers at UC Berkeley recently added evidence to the idea that life on Earth came from a comet.

The idea goes like this: the so-called “building blocks of life” on this planet are called dipeptides. And the real mystery is where these dipeptides came from. The Berkeley scientists’ research suggests that dipeptides could have formed on interplanetary dust and been carried down to earth on a comet. Berkeley writes:

Chemists from the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Hawaii, Manoa, showed that conditions in space are capable of creating complex dipeptides – linked pairs of amino acids – that are essential building blocks shared by all living things. The discovery opens the door to the possibility that these molecules were brought to Earth aboard a comet or possibly meteorites, catalyzing the formation of proteins (polypeptides), enzymes and even more complex molecules, such as sugars, that are necessary for life.

Or, in the paper itself, the authors put it this way:

Our results indicate that the radiation-induced, non-enzymatic formation of proteinogenic dipeptides in interstellar ice analogs is facile. Once synthesized and incorporated into the ”building material” of solar systems, biomolecules at least as complex as dipeptides could have been delivered to habitable planets such as early Earth by meteorites and comets, thus seeding the beginning of life as we know it.

They figured this out by making a mini-comet in the lab. Combining carbon dioxide, ammonia and other chemicals like methane at super cold temperatures (space is pretty cold), they created a tiny comet-like thing. Then they added the lab equivalent of cosmic rays, zapping the mini-comet with electrons. What they saw was that the combination of these high energy electrons and the comet they had built created organic molecules like amino acids and dipeptides.

The idea is that this reaction happened on its own in space, and those dipeptides were carried down to earth on that icy comet. In other words, the necessary blocks of life might really have descended to Earth from the sky.

<|begin_of_text|>As we know from our history books, the War for Independence began with the shots fired at Lexington and Concord. Those shots required gunpowder, a substance that was in short supply throughout the colonies. In 1775 there was only one American gunpowder mill, the Frankford Mill in Pennsylvania, and it was turning out a miniscule amount compared to what would be needed to wage a successful war.[1] In addition, this mill was not turning out the high-quality powder needed for artillery use. If the Patriots were going to have any chance of victory, the colonies needed to step up production or import it. Had it not been for the French assistance in supplying the Americans with gunpowder from 1776 throughout the war, American forces would not have been able to fight and win the battles that they did.

Gunpowder is a mixture of sulfur, charcoal, and potassium nitrate that must be combined in specific ratios. While this sounds simple enough, it must be remembered that in 1775 the state of chemistry was rudimentary. Potassium nitrate itself is a compound of nitrogen and potassium, neither element of which had been identified at that point in time.[2] What they did know was that what they called “nitre” was needed, which, in some recipes, involved soaking soil in urine from both animals and humans, and then allowing it to dry. The dried urine-soil was then boiled to produce saltpeter. Not all recipes agreed with this method which added to the problems in making gunpowder. Unfortunately this required half a year or more to produce nitre-bearing soil and created a bottleneck in the production of gunpowder in America.

When the War for Independence started American supplies of powder were what they had gathered from Royal sources or their own local supplies. The amount was not enough to sustain an army in the field. While Congress was hopeful that they could establish enough mills to create their own self-sustaining sources of gunpowder, they also decided to seek additional supplies from overseas which meant European suppliers. The Journals of the Continental Congress are full of references to purchasing gunpowder in the West Indies. To do so meant selling American goods which involved adjusting the rules under the Association agreement of 1774. As several congressional delegates noted, gunpowder was needed or else the whole enterprise was lost. A Secret Committee was set up on September 19, 1775 to contract and agree to importation of gunpowder not to exceed 500 tons.[3]

<|begin_of_text|>Oxygen on a planet might be a sign of life, but in two peculiar white dwarf stars it could indicate a narrow escape from a violent death. Their oxygen content marks them as failed stellar bombs – the remnants of stars that almost went supernova.

The new stars are among thousands of white dwarfs picked up by the Sloane Digital Sky Survey. Like all white dwarfs they are the dead, cooling cores left behind by mainstream stars, and are mainly made of helium. Usually the second most plentiful ingredient is carbon – but when a group of astronomers led by Boris Gänsicke at the University of Warwick, UK, analysed the spectrum of light from these two white dwarfs, they found that the objects hold far more oxygen than carbon.

“It’s extreme – these things look very different from any white dwarfs we’ve seen before,” says team member Danny Steeghs.

Creating so much oxygen requires a nuclear furnace fiercer than that needed for a carbon-rich mixture, so the stars that spawned these white dwarfs must have been hot and massive. Simulations suggest that they must have been almost too big to end their days gently – any larger, and they would have grown a core so massive and dense that it would inevitably have collapsed, releasing enough energy to blow the rest of the star apart in a supernova explosion.

The critical mass needed to create such a supernova is thought to be between 7 and 10 times that of the sun. These almost-bombs might help astrophysicists to pin down the threshold more precisely, and Gänsicke hopes to use the Very Large Telescope in Chile’s Atacama Desert to get a clearer spectrum and reveal their chemistry in more detail. “It will give the theoreticians something to work with,” he says.

<|begin_of_text|>Some say the world will end in fire, some in ice. One more reason to hold with those who favor fire: USC scientists have found that rock and soil breakdown in glaciers generates more acidity and releases more carbon than other forms of natural weathering, according to a new study.

Perhaps most interestingly, researchers say, it is the elevated oxidation of pyrite, popularly known as “fool’s gold,” in the glacial breakdown that produces increased acidity and leads to CO 2 escaping to the atmosphere from rivers and the oceans.

“CO 2 has gone up and down repeatedly over time, and we don’t really know why. Our study suggests that this process may play a meaningful role,” said Joshua West, professor of earth sciences and environmental studies at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the study’s corresponding author.

This means that, over very long earth cycles, nature is self-regulating against future runaway glaciation.

Graduate researcher Mark Torres of USC Dornsife’s Department of Earth Sciences served as the study’s lead author, which published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.

The fool’s gold standard

As oxidized pyrite slowly makes its way from glaciated water to the ocean, it creates an increase in CO 2 in the atmosphere.

We found glacial rivers are rich in dissolved sulfur, and when they’re rich in sulfur, we have found that this tends to be because of the weathering of pyrite or fool’s gold. Mark Torres

“We found glacial rivers are rich in dissolved sulfur, and when they’re rich in sulfur, we have found that this tends to be because of the weathering of pyrite or fool’s gold,” Torres said. “When these kinds of rivers flow into the ocean, the sulfur causes the transfer of carbon that was previously stored in rocks and the ocean back into the atmosphere.”

To measure the amount of carbon released by glacial weathering, Torres, West and the rest of the team analyzed a large database of 7,700 river glacier drainage samples.

The database was made up of a variety of samples collected from all over the world: Argentina, Canada, Greenland, Nepal, Iceland and the United States, among others. Included in the database were earlier field samples that had been collected by West and study co-author Jens Hartmann of the University of Hamburg.

The glacial river samples consistently demonstrated a lower alkalinity-to-carbon ratio than other river samples, which is indicative of pyrite weathering and carbon dioxide release

In addition to helping researchers better understand chemical structure and bonding, the sandwich molecule the team made containing two B 3 rings connected by sodium ions could serve a practical purpose as the first of a family of precursor compounds for preparing semiconducting, superconducting, and magnetic materials.

Thomas Kupfer, Holger Braunschweig, and Krzysztof Radacki of Julius Maximilian University Würzburg made the triboracyclopropenyl dianion by treating cyclohexyl-substituted dichloroaminoborane with sodium metal in dimethoxyethane solvent (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2015, DOI: 10.1002/anie.201508670). The Würzburg team has shown through computational, spectroscopic, and electrochemical studies that the B 3 ring has an electronic structure consistent with classical aromatic carbon compounds such as the cyclopropenyl cation and benzene.

The announcement “is certainly a great breakthrough and opens a new direction in boron chemistry,” comments Alexander I. Boldyrev of Utah State University, whose group has done much of the computational work on planar all-boron rings during the past 15 years.

Aromaticity as defined by the Hückel Rule has typically been the domain of carbon compounds, with only a few noncarbon analogs made from elements heavier than carbon. Chemists have long predicted that planar boron rings from B 3 up to B 15 or greater might also be aromatic. Researchers have been hot on the trail of making the boron rings, but the rings are challenging to stabilize in isolable compounds. The greatest success has come in generating the molecules with laser beams and studying them in the gas phase.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Today, a group of physicists reveal the answer. They say there are 6.02214084(18) × 10^23 atoms in a single crystal of silicon weighing about a kilogram. And they say they know this is right because they’ve counted them. Yep, counted them.

Actually, they counted the number of atoms in a unit volume of silicon and measured the size of this volume. The number of times this fits into a lump of exactly 1 mole of near perfect single crystal sphere of silicon is Avogadro’s number.

To have established this number to such accuracy is clearly an important piece of work but just how impressive is put in perspective by the monumental efforts of the international consortium behind it.

The work began in 2004 when a Russian group created a sample of silicon flouride with a specific isotopic content at the Central Design Bureau of Machine Building in St. Petersburg. A team at the Institute of Chemistry of High-Purity Substances of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Nizhny-Novgorod then turned this into a polycrystal of silicon hydride which a group at the Leibniz-Institut fur Kristallzuchtung in Berlin used to grow a 5kg lump of pure monocrystalline silicon in 2007.

The Australian Centre for Precision Optics then took samples from this lump and shaped them into quasi-perfect spheres. They then made an x-ray interferometer from the left over silicon to determine its crystal structure. They also measured crystals’ surfaces to see what kind of crud had built up there and would therefore have to be taken into account in the final calculations. (Various copper, nickel and silicon oxides had built up on the surface.)

Various groups then measured the mass of the spheres by comparing them to the platinum-iridium test kilograms owned by the PTB (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt) in Germany, the National Metrology Institute of Japan in Tskuba and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures in France.

The team then measured the volume of the spheres using optical interferometry. And the isotope content was measured by teams at the University of Warsaw, the Institute of Mineral Resources of the Chinese Academy of Science and Institute for Physics of Microstructures of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

The dish, one of the most common Korean foods made from dog meat, has a long history in Korean culture, but has in recent years been criticized both inside and outside Korea by people with a food taboo on dog meat.

History [ edit ]

The consumption of dog meat can be traced back to antiquity. Dog bones were excavated in a neolithic settlement in Changnyeong (창녕), South Gyeongsang Province. A wall painting in the Goguryeo tombs complex (고구려 고분군; 高句麗 古墳群) in South Hwanghae Province, a UNESCO World Heritage site which dates from 4th century AD, depicts a slaughtered dog in a storehouse (Ahn, 2000).[4]

Approximately in 1816, Jeong Hak Yu (정학유; 丁學遊), the second son of Jeong Yak-yong (정약용; 丁若鏞), a prominent politician and scholar of Choseon dynasty at the time, wrote a poem called Nongawollyeonga (농가월령가; 農家月令歌). This poem, an important source of Korean folk history, describes what ordinary Korean farmer families did in each month of a year. In the description of August, the poem tells of a married woman visiting her birth parents with boiled dog meat, rice cake, and rice wine, thus showing the popularity of dog meat at the time (Ahn, 2000; Seo, 2002).

In Dongguk Seshigi (동국세시기; 東國歲時記), a book written by a Korean scholar Hong Suk Mo (홍석모; 洪錫謨) in 1849, contains a recipe of Boshintang including a boiled dog and green

<|begin_of_text|>This article is about the boiling point of liquids. For other uses, see Boiling point (disambiguation)

Boiling water

The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the pressure surrounding the liquid[1][2] and the liquid changes into a vapor.

The boiling point of a liquid varies depending upon the surrounding environmental pressure. A liquid in a partial vacuum has a lower boiling point than when that liquid is at atmospheric pressure. A liquid at high pressure has a higher boiling point than when that liquid is at atmospheric pressure. For example, water boils at 100 °C (212 °F) at sea level, but at 93.4 °C (200.1 °F) at 1,905 metres (6,250 ft) [3] altitude. For a given pressure, different liquids will boil at different temperatures.

The normal boiling point (also called the atmospheric boiling point or the atmospheric pressure boiling point) of a liquid is the special case in which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the defined atmospheric pressure at sea level, 1 atmosphere.[4][5] At that temperature, the vapor pressure of the liquid becomes sufficient to overcome atmospheric pressure and allow bubbles of vapor to form inside the bulk of the liquid. The standard boiling point has been defined by IUPAC since 1982 as the temperature at which boiling occurs under a pressure of 1 bar.[6]

The heat of vaporization is the energy required to transform a given quantity (a mol, kg, pound, etc.) of a substance from a liquid into a gas at a given pressure (often atmospheric pressure).

Liquids may change to a vapor at temperatures below their boiling points through the process of evaporation. Evaporation is a surface phenomenon in which molecules located near the liquid's edge, not contained by enough liquid pressure on that side, escape into the surroundings as vapor. On the other hand, boiling is a process in which molecules anywhere in the liquid escape, resulting in the formation of vapor bubbles within the liquid.

Saturation temperature and pressure [ edit ]

Demonstration of the lower boiling point of water at lower pressure, achieved by using a vacuum pump

A saturated liquid contains as much thermal energy as it can without boiling (or conversely a saturated vapor contains as little thermal energy as it can without condensing).

Saturation temperature means boiling point. The saturation temperature is the temperature for a corresponding saturation pressure at which a liquid boils into its vapor phase. The liquid can be said

Not surprisingly, Levi's observed our daily style and forced the question on us, why not wear denim on your commutes? And with its new Commuter Trucker Jacket, we find ourselves asking the same question. Why not? This isn't some run-of-the-mill, one-off attempt at appeasing a subculture. Instead, Levi's worked closely with cyclists in multiple cities around America, distributing prototypes and accepting feedback. And, as a result of developing the jacket in accordance to critique, Levi's effectively dialed-in the fit, accoutrement, and finishes to what cyclists are actually asking for. Accordingly, Levi's adapted its staple denim jacket to the purpose of cycling. The Commuter Trucker features a water-resistant and dirt-repellent NanoSphere protective finish to make commuting in hostile weather a little more acceptable, especially if your destination is the office. It's for this very reason that Levi's also incorporated an odor-resistant Sanitized finish to the jacket, too. So, clever compositions aside, Levi's also gave the Trucker a cycling-specific cut. What does this mean? To start, the rear hem has been elongated in order to provide additional coverage while you're stretched out over the bars. Additionally, the arms have been lengthened for the same reason. Levi's has also created the pattern of the Trucker on a slight contour with built-in stretch panels running parallel with the torso. You'll also find specific features for cycling like a large flapped-vent across the back panel. Additionally, the elongated tail is capable of being moved up and out of the way with button closures. Furthermore, you're also able to let in or let out the waist hem with button closures.

Posted on 14 August 2011 by MarkR

Recently there’s been a resurgence in claims that CO 2 rise is caused by 'natural' temperature rise rather than humans. Various arguments are used to make this sound sensible (see Paolo Soares, Murry Salby and Joe Bastardi), but they’re wrong.

I’m going to pick on just one of the claims Joe Bastardi made in a comment at Tamino’s blog and this is written as an explanation to Joe of why I’m convinced he’s wrong. I hope readers will be able to point out if I’ve made a mistake and work out which argument you think makes the most sense. Bastardi claims that:

“The answer is obvious. it is the earths temperature which is driving the co2 release into the atmosphere.”

I’m going to start with chemistry; most carbon in the atmosphere is in CO2 and it can move between the atmosphere and land/oceans through chemical reactions. Billions of tons of carbon don't magically turn into pixie dust.

Next some maths: if I have one ton of carbon and I add another ton of carbon then I have two. We can write this down as an equation for the change in atmospheric CO 2 over a year, ΔC atm :

This says that if I ‘emit’ a ton of carbon by, say, triggering a volcano then the atmosphere will gain a ton. If I ‘absorb’ a ton of carbon by growing a tree, then the atmosphere loses a ton.

We can expand the equation by counting human emissions (HE) and absorption (HA) and natural emissions (NE) and absorption (NA) separately.

This works because carbon is additive. If a volcano emits a ton of carbon and a factory emits a ton then the atmosphere has gained two tons. This is a very simple balance sheet for the carbon cycle and fortunately there are ‘accountants’ who’ve measured some of these values for us.

Recently the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has been rising at ~2 parts per million per year, or around 15 billion tons/year. Meanwhile human emissions excluding land use change (like clearing or planting forests) are 30 billion tons per year. In billions of tons per year we have:

We can rearrange this:

Humans are also clearing rainforests and changing land use, but here I'll assume that human effects on absorption (HA) are not much different from zero, i.e.

\”Attempts to calculate the Hoyle state have been unsuccessful since 1954,\” said Professor Dr. Ulf-G. Meißner (Helmholtz-Institut für Strahlen- und Kernphysik der Universität Bonn). \”But now, we have done it!\” The Hoyle state is an energy-rich form of the carbon nucleus. It is the mountain pass over which all roads from one valley to the next lead: From the three nuclei of helium gas to the much larger carbon nucleus. This fusion reaction takes place in the hot interior of heavy stars. If the Hoyle state did not exist, only very little carbon or other higher elements such as oxygen, nitrogen and iron could have formed. Without this type of carbon nucleus, life probably also would not have been possible.

The search for the \”slave transmitter\”

The Hoyle state had been verified by experiments as early as 1954, but calculating it always failed. For this form of carbon consists of only three, very loosely linked helium nuclei – more of a cloudy diffuse carbon nucleus. And it does not occur individually, only together with other forms of carbon. \”This is as if you wanted to analyze a radio signal whose main transmitter and several slave transmitters are interfering with each other,\” explained Prof. Dr. Evgeny Epelbaum (Institute of Theoretical Physics II at Ruhr-Universität Bochum). The main transmitter is the stable carbon nucleus from which humans – among others – are made. \”But we are interested in one of the unstable, energy-rich carbon nuclei; so we have to separate the weaker radio transmitter somehow from the dominant signal by means of a noise filter.\”

What made this possible was a new, improved calculating approach the researchers used that allowed calculating the forces between several nuclear particles more precisely than ever. And in JUGENE, the supercomputer at Forschungszentrum Jülich, a suitable tool was found. It took JUGENE almost a week of calculating. The results matched the experimental data so well that the researchers can be certain that they have indeed calculated the Hoyle state.

The by-products of all this rampant combustion are smelly compounds called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. These molecules "seem to be all over the universe," says Louis Allamandola, the founder and director of the Astrophysics and Astrochemistry Lab at NASA Ames Research Center. "And they float around forever," appearing in comets, meteors and space dust. These hydrocarbons have even been shortlisted for the basis of the earliest forms of life on Earth. Not surprisingly, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can be found in coal, oil and even food.

Though a pure, unadulterated whiff of outer space is impossible for humans (it's a vacuum after all; we would die if we tried), when astronauts are outside the ISS, space-borne compounds adhere to their suits and hitch a ride back into the station. Astronauts have reported smelling "burned" or "fried" steak after a space walk, and they aren't just dreaming of a home-cooked meal.

The smell of space is so distinct that, three years ago, NASA reached out to Steven Pearce of the fragrance maker Omega Ingredients to re-create the odor for its training simulations. "Recently we did the smell of the moon," Pearce says. "Astronauts compared it to spent gunpowder."

Allamandola explains that our solar system is particularly pungent because it is rich in carbon and low in oxygen, and "just like a car, if you starve it of oxygen you start to see black soot and get a foul smell." Oxygen-rich stars, however, have aromas reminiscent of a charcoal grill. Once you leave our galaxy, the smells can get really interesting. In dark pockets of the universe, molecular clouds full of tiny dust particles host a veritable smorgasbord of odors, from wafts of sweet sugar to the rotten-egg stench of sulfur.

Virtual reality (VR) headsets such as the Oculus Rift will line store shelves this holiday season, and UC San Diego alumni startup Nanome, Inc. plans to capitalize on that by creating VR apps for the consumer market, the classroom, and beyond.

Nanome co-founder Steven McCloskey was part of the first graduating class of NanoEngineering at UC San Diego when he received his bachelor’s degree in 2015. Frustrated by the lack of tools available to nanoengineers for complex 3D modeling and simulation at the nanoscale, he set out to try and rectify the problem. He and colleagues built the first molecular visualization, modeling and simulation tool for today’s VR platforms called nano-one. The application allows users to build molecules with carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen atoms.

“Our goal is to provide the tools necessary to help people build new proteins and molecules and eventually also simulate their interactions,” said McCloskey. “You can see how the world works at this fundamental level, and re-make it.”

Why VR? Everything is made out of atoms—cosmetics, computer hardware, everything. Take a chair, for example. A chair can’t just look like a chair, it has to act like one. If you’re going to be manipulating things in 3D, you also need to be able to change the material properties of an object, which is dictated by structures at the nanoscale level.

McCloskey said he believes nanoscale virtual reality represents the future of engineering.

“UC San Diego is where this has to happen—we have a NanoEngineering department, VR experts, Protein Databank, interdisciplinary researchers, and we’re located in Biotech Beach,” he said.

Nano-one is now being tested in the UC San Diego Chemistry Department and in the consumer market for workflow integration, modeling precision, and optimal pattern-recognition and discovery.

As nano-one was being developed, McCloskey and his colleagues had an idea for another VR tool that would help engineers with math.

“When I was in Vector Calculus as a NanoEngineering major, I wanted better 3D graphics to go along with the instruction,” said McCloskey.

It is hard to imagine you could reconstruct a record of fog dating back thousands of years, but this is exactly what Chilean scientists have done.

The low-lying cloud is seemingly so transient and intangible, and unlike rivers and glaciers it leaves no easy-to-read impressions on the landscape.

And yet, a Santiago team has been able to trace the fog history of the Atacama Desert by studying Tillandsia plants.

Their chemistry suggests strongly that this local fog has increased over time.

It is a period covering the last 3,500 years.

"I don't think there's any other place in the world where I've actually seen a record of fog, even spanning the last hundred years," said Claudio Latorre Hidalgo from the Catholic University of Chile.

"What little we know about fog is from measurement instrumental data that we have, and from satellite data that only spans the last 20 years.

"So, this is actually a unique opportunity to study the evolution of a fog ecosystem over the Late Holocene, and what are the major drivers and controls of the mechanisms that produce that fog in the long term - the very long term."

The palaeoclimate expert was discussing his team's research here at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union - the world's largest annual gathering of Earth scientists.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Claudio Latorre Hidalgo: "The fog is the plants’ only source of water and nutrients"

The Atacama is famous for its super-arid conditions; there are places where it has not rained for years.

But life can eke out an existence if it can exploit the fog that rolls in off the Pacific. Tillandsia are a perfectly adapted opportunist.

These wiry, grey plants have no roots. They clutch weakly at sand dunes, but arrange themselves at every spatial scale to maximise their capture of the fog.

They derive everything they need from the damp air - not simply the must-have water, but also all the chemical nutrients required to underpin their biology.

Dr Latorre Hidalgo and colleagues have dug deep into the dunes to uncover a multi-millennia succession of Tillandsia; and they have described a pronounced trend: the younger the plants, the more of the lighter type, or isotope, of nitrogen atom that they have incorporated into their tissues.

<|begin_of_text|>Americium-241 (241Am) is an isotope of americium. Like all isotopes of americium, it is radioactive. 241Am is the most common isotope of americium. It is the most prevalent isotope of americium in nuclear waste. Americium-241 has a half-life of 432.2 years. It is commonly found in ionization type smoke detectors. It is a potential fuel for long-lifetime radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). Its common parent nuclides are β− from 241Pu, EC from 241Cm and α from 245Bk. 241Am is fissile and the critical mass of a bare sphere is 57.6-75.6 kilograms and a sphere diameter of 19–21 centimeters.[1] Americium-241 has a specific activity of 3.43 Ci/g (curies per gram or 126.9 gigabequerels (GBq) per gram).[2] It is commonly found in the form of americium-241 dioxide (241AmO 2 ). This isotope also has one meta state; 241mAm, with an excitation energy of 2.2 MeV, and a half-life of 1.23 μs. The presence of americium-241 in plutonium is determined by the original concentration of plutonium-241 and the sample age. Because of the low penetration of alpha radiation, americium-241 only poses a health risk when ingested or inhaled. Older samples of plutonium containing plutonium-241 contain a buildup of 241Am. A chemical removal of americium-241 from reworked plutonium (e.g. during reworking of plutonium pits) may be required in some cases.

Nucleosynthesis [ edit ]

Americium-241 has been produced in small quantities in nuclear reactors for decades, and many kilograms of 241Am have been accumulated by now.[3] Nevertheless, since it was first offered for sale in 1962, its price, about US$1,500 per gram of 241Am, remains almost unchanged owing to the very complex separation procedure.[4]

Americium-241 is not synthesized directly from uranium – the most common reactor material – but from the plutonium isotope 239Pu. The latter needs to be produced first, according to the following nuclear process:

<|begin_of_text|>There may be enough oxygen in the waters of Jupiter's moon Europa to support millions of tons worth of fish, according to a new study. And while nobody is suggesting there might actually be fish on Europa, this finding suggests the Jovian satellite could be capable of supporting the kinds of life familiar to us here on Earth, if only in microbial form.

Europa, which is roughly the size of Earth's moon, is enveloped by a global ocean about 100 miles deep (160 km), with an icy crust that may be only a few miles thick. From what we know of Earth, where there is water, there is a chance at life, so for many years scientists have speculated that this Jovian moon could support extraterrestrials.

As we learned more about Jupiter's effect on its moons, the possibility for life on Europa grew even more likely. Studies showed the moon could have enough oxygen to support the kind of life we are most familiar with on Earth.

IN PICTURES: Jupiter

The ice on the surface, like all water, is made from hydrogen and oxygen, and the constant stream of radiation pouring in from Jupiter reacts with this ice to form free oxygen and other oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide. The reactivity of oxygen is key to generating the energy that helped multi-cellular life flourish on our planet.

Still, researchers had thought there was no effective method for delivering any of this oxygen-rich matter into Europa's ocean. Scientists had assumed the primary way for surface materials to migrate downward was from the impacts it would suffer from cosmic debris, which regularly bombards everything in our solar system. [Photos of Jupiter's moons.]

However, past calculations suggested that even after a few billion years, such "impact gardening" would never lead to an oxygenated layer more than some 33 feet (10 meters) deep into the ice shell, nowhere far enough down to reach the underlying ocean.

However, the new study suggests this oxygen-rich layer could be far thicker than before thought, potentially encompassing the entire crust. The key is looking at other ways to stir Europa's crust, explained researcher Richard Greenberg, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at Tucson.

The gravitational pull Europa experiences from Jupiter leads to tidal forces roughly 1,000 times stronger than what Earth feels from our moon, flexing and heating Europa and making it very active geologically. This could explain why its surface appears no older than 50 million years old — its surface underwent complete turnover in that time

"This is an incredible adventure to get to this point so early in the mission, I feel giddy," said John Grunsfeld NASA associate administrator for science.

The major finding was made in spite of a weak wisp of organics measured by the rover's instruments, except for a major spike in carbon dioxide from the material when heated to 1,535 deg. F (835 deg. C).

The signatures of more than five hundred mass values were sampled during the heating of this drilled sample and analyzed by the SAM instrument. Five are shown in the graph. These traces are diagnostic of water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and two forms of sulfur, sulfur dioxide, the oxidized form, and hydrogen sulfide, the reduced form. The high deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio in water in the Mars atmosphere is a signature of the lighter hydrogen more rapidly escaping to space over geological time. Credit: NASA/ JPL-Caltech/GSFC.

The new data from the powder drilled from within a rock at Yellowknife Bay indicates that mineralogy, chemistry and abundant fresh water conditions that existed at the time would have supported the existence of prokaryotic organisms.

Such microbes "do not use organics to metabolize, but rather process inorganic compounds for food and energy", said John Grotzinger of Caltech, project scientist for the Mars Science Laboratory.

"There does need to be a source of carbon there somewhere," Grotzinger said. "But if it is just carbon dioxide you can have a "Chemolitho autotrophic organism" that literally feeds on rocks. Such organisms will metabolize and generate organic compounds based on carbon in the carbon dioxide," the project scientist said at a Washington briefing on sample results.

Curiosity's SAM instrument detected the simple carbon-containing compounds chloro- and dichloromethane from the powdered rock sample extracted from the "John Klein" rock on Mars. These species were detected by the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GCMS) on Curiosity's Sample Analysis at Mars instrument.

Boron nitride has made news repeatedly in recent years as a material with an appealing mix of structural and physical properties. But it hasn’t made news as a catalyst, and certainly not one with the potential to drive global-scale industrial chemical processes.

That all just changed. Researchers have demonstrated that boron nitride (BN) selectively catalyzes conversion of propane to propene, a valuable chemical used worldwide on the multimillion-ton-per-year scale (Science 2016, DOI: 10.1126/science.aaf7885).

Researchers have mainly studied nanotube and one-atom-thick forms of BN that boast high strength, heat resistance, and unique electronic properties. A team at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, including Joseph T. Grant and Ive Hermans, have shown that BN unexpectedly works well as a catalyst that drives oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). This process strips hydrogen from propane to form propene and oxidizes the hydrogen to form water.

Manufacturers typically produce propene by “cracking” large hydrocarbons in naphtha, a component of crude oil, with steam. But steam cracking plants have started to use shale gas instead of naphtha as a feedstock, a process that yields less propene. This has forced manufacturers to look for alternative ways to boost propene output.

Several dehydrogenation methods that do not use an oxidizer can drive the propane-to-propene reaction. But these methods gunk up the catalysts, shortening their lifetimes. Also, nonoxidative dehydrogenation and steam cracking are both highly endothermic, and therefore energy intensive.

In contrast, ODHP is exothermic and can run efficiently at hundreds of degrees lower than the other processes. According to industry estimates, a reaction running at relatively low temperatures such as these could reduce energy input by 45%. But the many ODHP catalysts that have been studied overoxidize propene, forming unwanted yet thermodynamically stable CO and CO 2.

Not BN. The Wisconsin team finds that in the presence of oxygen, BN nanotubes and hexagonal-BN convert propane to propene and generate ethene, a valuable commodity, as the main by-product. Under one set of conditions, the reaction generated roughly 80% propene and 12

<|begin_of_text|>One of the greatest questions of our time is whether we are alone in the universe. And if there is some sort of extraterrestrial life out there, what are those aliens like?

Neil deGrasse Tyson thinks we may have at least a glimpse within the coming decades, because we are likely to find out whether life has ever existed anywhere else in our solar system.

Read: Here’s How Black Holes and Supernovas Kill You In Space

In a recent “ask me anything” post on Reddit, the astrophysicist answered questions about aliens in our galactic neighborhood as well as in outer space in general. He said it’s entirely possible we will know “in the next couple of decades” whether Mars ever hosted life, and within the next century for the rest of the solar system as a whole, which includes moons in the outer reaches like Europa, Titan and Enceladus.

But he has bad news for the people alive today who hope to have intelligent conversations with alien life forms that are more complex than a microorganism: Earth is probably not close enough to where those extraterrestrials live.

“It’s all about our capacity to travel interstellar distances,” Tyson wrote. “And that’s surely not happening in the next 50 years. Not the rate things are going today.”

Until technology advances, scientists are looking for life on other planets in the ways they know how. That includes searching for the things that sustain us on Earth, like water, oxygen and a temperature that is not too hot and not too cold. Although that seems like a biased approach, since other life forms could live under entirely different conditions, Tyson pointed out that the most crucial elements that sustain life on our planet — which include carbon, oxygen and hydrogen — are also among the most common elements in the universe. So maybe we are onto something after all.

And if the idea of the universe’s vastness and all the potential aliens it holds makes you feel small, Tyson has a remedy for that.

“Why not instead think of how awesome it is that our [3-pound] human brain matter actually figured all this out,” he said. “Why not look up to the clear night sky, and reflect on the fact that we don’t simply live in this universe, but the universe lives within us — through the atoms and molecules of our bodies, forged in the hearts of stars that long-ago gave their lives to the galaxy... and to us.”

Its structure consists of chains of boron atoms (blue) connected into a slab by iron atoms (red) separated by layers of aluminum atoms (grey). Credit: J. Am. Chem. Soc.

Refrigerators in our kitchens cool food by powering pumps that compress gases like Freon. Some scientists and engineers would like to scrap those energy inefficient compressors and chill refrigerators using low energy magnets. These researchers are on the hunt for practical materials that exhibit the magnetocaloric effect—the ability of a substance to heat and cool under the influence of a magnetic field. Now a team at Florida State University has shown that inexpensive transition-metal borides exhibit the magnetocaloric effect at low magnetic fields (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013, DOI: 10.1021/ja404107p).

A material that exhibits a magnetocaloric effect will heat up in an applied magnetic field and then cool when the field is removed. Basically, the material releases energy when a magnetic field forces its magnetic poles to align and then absorbs energy when the field is gone and the poles randomize.

In 1997, Karl A. Gschneidner Jr. and colleagues at the Ames National Laboratory demonstrated the first material with a strong magnetocaloric effect at near room temperature. Unfortunately, this alloy of gadolinium, silicon, and germanium (Gd 5 Si 2 Ge 2 ) requires strong magnetic fields applied by an electromagnet to cool down significantly. It also contains expensive rare-earth elements.

Since that discovery, materials scientists have been hunting for magnetocaloric materials that work under the relatively weak magnetic fields produced by strong permanent magnets. Without the need to power an electromagnet, a magnetic refrigerator would require little energy to operate.

During that hunt for new materials, no one had looked at borides, says Michael Shatruk, a chemist at Florida State University. Shatruk notes that the strongest permanent magnets are made from neodymium iron boron. He thought that taking out the neodymium might give the material magnetocaloric properties. Indeed, he and his colleagues found that iron boron and manganese boron exhibit the magnetocaloric effect—but at about 300 °C. Computer modeling suggested that adding aluminum ions would bring down the temperature to more practical levels.

To test their prediction, Shatruk’s group synthesized the aluminum iron bor

Go here to find the largest selection of Blue lagoon tours in Iceland The Lagoon is just a fifteen-minute drive from Keflavík International Airport, or a thirty-minute drive from Reykjavík, located between the two. It is thus often visited straight after arrival to the country or right before departure. There are few better ways to recharge after a long-flight or action-packed holiday. History The Blue Lagoon started as a pool of wastewater from the Svartsengi geothermal plant in 1976. The first person to bathe there was Valur Margeirsson in 1981. He was met with some resistance prior to taking the first dip as people thought he was mad for wanting to bath in a "blue mud pool". He and others soon began to notice the unusual but remarkable healing qualities of the azure waters. Those with conditions such as psoriasis found the waters immediately soothing for their condition. News quickly spread, and by 1987, the first swimming facilities were officially opened. Since then, the establishment has only grown, from an open pool with no surrounding buildings to a luxurious spa, research centre and hotel. Today The Blue Lagoon is considered to have such notable regenerative qualities because the water is rich in silica and sulphur. A research and development facility on site finds cures and remedies for skin ailments, and silica mud is available for free on the sides of the pool for guests to enjoy a facemask. The temperature in the bathing and swimming area is very comfortable, averaging 37–39° C (98–102° F). The Blue Lagoon also boasts the LAVA Restaurant, the Blue Café and the Lagoon Spa: you can thus enjoy cocktails, health products, delicious meals and treatments such as massages without leaving the premises. Saunas, steam rooms and a small waterfall are also on site. For all of these reasons and more, the Blue Lagoon is considered to be one of the most enjoyable and romantic spots in the country. It is surrounded by a plethora of fantastic volcanic landscapes, and the water itself is opaque and vividly blue. Rising pillars of steam only add to the spa’s fantastic ambience. Things to Note The Blue Lagoon Spa is open throughout the year, and popular in every season. Due to the fact it has a maximum capacity for the comfort of its guests,

This so-called interstellar material was spotted by NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX), a spacecraft that is studying the edge of the solar system from its orbit about 200,000 miles (322,000 kilometers) above Earth.

"This alien interstellar material is really the stuff that stars and planets and people are made of — it's really important to be measuring it," David McComas, IBEX principal investigator and assistant vice president of the Space Science and Engineering Division at Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, said in a news briefing from NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.

An international team of scientists presented new findings from IBEX, which included the first detection of alien particles of hydrogen, oxygen and neon, in addition to the confirmation of previously detected helium. [Images from NASA's IBEX Mission]

These atoms are remnants of older stars that have ended their lives in violent explosions, called supernovas, which dispersed the elements throughout the galaxy. As interstellar wind blows these charged and neutral particles through the Milky Way, the IBEX probe is able to create a census of the elements that are present.

Heavy elements in space

According to the new study, the researchers found 74 oxygen atoms for every 20 neon atoms in the interstellar wind. For comparison, there are 111 oxygen atoms for every 20 neon atoms in our solar system, meaning there are more oxygen atoms in any part of the solar system than in nearby interstellar space, the scientists said in a statement.

"These are important elements to know quantitatively because they are the building blocks of stars, planets, people," McComas said. "We discovered this puzzle: matter outside our solar system doesn't look like material inside our solar system. It seems to be deficient in oxygen compared to neon."

The presence of less oxygen within interstellar material could indicate that the sun formed in a region with less oxygen compared to its current location, the researchers said.

Or, it could be a sign that oxygen is "locked up" in other galactic materials, such as cosmic grains of dust or ice. [Top 10 Strangest Things in Space]

Elements and the ‘Big Bang’ theory

During the formation of the universe some 14 billion years ago in the so-called ‘Big Bang’, only the lightest elements were formed – hydrogen and helium along with trace amounts of lithium and beryllium. As the cloud of cosmic dust and gases from the Big Bang cooled, stars formed, and these then grouped together to form galaxies.

The other 86 elements found in nature were created in nuclear reactions in these stars and in huge stellar explosions known as supernovae.

For most of their lives, stars fuse elemental hydrogen into helium in their cores. Two atoms of hydrogen are combined in a series of steps to create helium-4. These reactions account for 85% of the Sun’s energy. The remaining 15% comes from reactions that produce the elements beryllium and lithium.

The energy from these nuclear reactions is emitted in various forms of radiation such as ultraviolet light, X-rays, visible light, infrared rays, microwaves and radio waves. In addition, energised particles such as neutrinos and protons are released, and it is these that make up the solar wind.

Earth is in the path of this energy stream, which warms the planet, drives weather and provides energy for life. The Earth’s atmosphere is able to screen out most of the harmful radiation, and the Earth’s magnetic field can deflect the harmful effects of the solar wind.

Dying stars

When a star’s core runs out of hydrogen, the star begins to die out. The dying star expands into a red giant, and this now begins to manufacture carbon atoms by fusing helium atoms.

More massive stars begin a further series of nuclear burning or reaction stages. The elements formed in these stages range from oxygen through to iron.

During a supernova, the star releases very large amounts of energy as well as neutrons, which allows elements heavier than iron, such as uranium and gold, to be produced. In the supernova explosion, all of these elements are expelled out into space.

Our world is literally made up of elements formed deep within the cores of stars now long dead. As Britain’s Astronomer Royal Sir Martin Rees said, “We are literally the ashes of long dead stars.” When you buy a

Pal Media is one of the largest television providers in Palestine, carrying not only RT but also Al Mayadeen, TransMedia and western outlets BBC News and France 24.

The Israeli regime stated that the eight broadcasters whose offices were vandalised and whose expensive broadcasting equipment was either stolen or smashed, were carrying, among many other things, Hamas related media organisations.

With Hamas and Fatah, the two main Palestinian parties, formalising a unity agreement, Tel Aviv continues to vocalise strong disapprobation, stating that they refuse to negotiate with the organisation in any guise, even though journalists have exposed the fact that Israel covertly helped to found Hamas in the 1980s.

The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates has condemned the move by Tel Aviv in the following statement,

“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates condemns in the strongest terms the aggression by the Israeli occupying forces against the headquarters of a number of Palestinian media institutions in the occupied west bank, and the ministry asserts that such piracy is in the context of ongoing attempts to conceal its daily crimes and acts of aggression. It represents a failed attempt to terrorise and prevent media institutions from doing their part in exposing violations by the occupiers and settlers”.

RT further reports,

“Pal Media and RT offices have already fallen victim to the Israeli forces’ raids. In 2014, they broke into the Ramallah office and seized hardware and videotapes as well as breaking a computer and office furniture. In June 2017, Israeli military raided Pal Media’s headquarters in the city, targeting the Palestinian Al-Quds channel. Israel has previously raided TransMedia, which runs several offices across the country, including two offices in Jerusalem, the area disputed by Palestinians and Israelis, and an office in Hebron in the West bank”.

<|begin_of_text|>Eons ago the earth had a mantle of rock. Then the glaciers slowly and inexorably moved and ground the rocks into a thick layer we called dirt. The dirt supported plant life, which took in the minerals needed for growth, and gardens were born. Over thousands of years, essential micronutrients were continually taken up by plants, often to the point of exhaustion. We as gardeners attempt to add nutrients back to the soil by means of fertilizers, compost and/or other amendments that we purchase and apply in vast and expensive quantities. However, those materials rarely contain all the micronutrients eroded away or taken up by plants.

What are Micronutirents?

“Eight of the seventeen elements essential for plant growth are micronutrients. On soils deficient in these micronutrients, the application of small amounts of these nutrients can greatly enhance crop production. The micronutrients are Boron (B), chlorine (Cl), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo) and zinc (Zn). With the exception of nitrogen, all plant nutrients are of geological origin. Under natural climatic conditions the physical breakup, chemical weathering and release of nutrients from minerals is not fast enough to provide the nutrients for annual crop production.” [1]

There was an area of New Zealand where the sheep were dying for no obvious reasons – there was plenty of food. Then it was discovered that the soils were deficient in the element cobalt. It is well known that cobalt is needed for our immune systems. Another example is provided by E.I. Steifel, Science, 996, vol. 272, where he showed that the process that accounts for much of natural nitrogen fixation in soils requires molybdenum. In many soils adding a trace of Mo would reduce the need for nitrogen fertilizers. [2]

It has been suggested elsewhere that there are as many as 90 minerals needed by plants. Minerals are also essential for human health and the human body utilizes over 80 minerals for maximum function. [3] Because our plants and soils are so nutrient depleted, even if we eat the healthiest foods, we are not getting all the minerals we need.

There is one simple solution: rock dust. Rock dust is generally a by-product of the gravel industry and is available almost everywhere, often free for the taking. Rock ‘gravel’ or dust is found in the bottom of creek beds, and pond settlings

A photogenic and favorite target for amateur astronomers, the full beauty of nearby barred spiral galaxy M83 is unveiled in all of its glory in this Hubble Space Telescope mosaic image. The vibrant magentas and blues reveal that the galaxy is ablaze with star formation. The galaxy, also known as the Southern Pinwheel, lies 15 million light-years away in the constellation Hydra.

The Hubble photograph captures thousands of star clusters, hundreds of thousands of individual stars, and “ghosts” of dead stars called supernova remnants. The galactic panorama unveils a tapestry of the drama of stellar birth and death spread across 50,000 light-years.

The newest generations of stars are forming largely in clusters on the edges of the dark spiral dust lanes. These brilliant young stellar groupings, only a few million years old, produce huge amounts of ultraviolet light that is absorbed by surrounding diffuse gas clouds, causing them to glow in pinkish hydrogen light.

Gradually, the fierce stellar winds from the youngest most massive stars blow away the gas, revealing bright blue star clusters and giving a “Swiss cheese” appearance to the spiral arms. These youngest star clusters are about 1 million to 10 million years old. The populations of stars up to 100 million years or older appear yellow or orange by comparison because the young blue stars have already burned out.

Interstellar “bubbles” produced by nearly 300 supernovas from massive stars have been found in this Hubble image. By studying these supernova remnants, astronomers can better understand the nature of the stars that exploded and dispersed nuclear processed chemical elements back into the galaxy, contributing to the next generation of new stars.

This image is being used to support a citizen science project titled STAR DATE: M83. The primary goal is to estimate ages for approximately 3,000 star clusters. Amateur scientists will use the presence or absence of the pink hydrogen emission, the sharpness of the individual stars, and the color of the clusters to estimate ages. Participants will measure the sizes of the star clusters and any associated emission nebulae. Finally, the citizen scientists will “explore” the image, identifying a variety of objects ranging from background galaxies to supernova remnants to foreground stars.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Hecho en México….me cae, que vergüenza nacional. Ahora las dichosas, famosas, omnipotentes y glamorosas preseas mexicanas de los juegos Panamericanos se han empezado a despintar a menos de 2 semanas de su entrega, ¡HECF!

¿Pues no se suponen que eran de oro, plata y bronce? Claro que no, para comparación utilicemos las medallas olímpicas. La última medalla olímpica de oro que realmente era de oro fue otorgada en 1912. Pero por el hecho de que no sean de oro no quiere decir que son de baja calidad. Las medallas olímpicas de oro y plata están hechas de plata. Las medallas de oro llevan un recubrimiento de al menos 6 gramos de oro. Las medallas de bronce están hechas de una aleación de bronce, cobre y estaño. Pero claro, estamos hablando de las medallas olímpicas. Las medallas que fueron entregadas en los pasados juegos Panamericanos de Guadalajara fueron hechas de cobre con un bañito a la mexicana de cada metal respectivo…

Pero el bañito fue hecho tan a la mexicana que algunas medallas comenzaron a despintarse desde el primer día que fueron entregadas.

El remero Patrick Loliger, fue de los primeros en notar que su presea de tercer lugar comenzó a tornarse grisácea. Tras reclamar a la Casa de Moneda de México, encargada de acuñar las medallas, pidieron una disculpa y ofrecieron cambiarla.

Lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) batteries have emerged in recent years as a possible successor to lithium-ion batteries — the industry standard for consumer electronics — due to their potential for holding a charge for a very long time. Electronic devices would go for weeks without charging, for instance; electric cars could travel four to five times longer than the current standard.

But before this could happen, researchers need to make the Li-O2 batteries efficient enough for commercial application and prevent the formation of lithium peroxide, a solid precipitate that covers the surface of the batteries' oxygen electrodes. One obstacle is finding a catalyst that efficiently facilitates a process known as oxygen evolution reaction, in which lithium oxide products decompose back into lithium ions and oxygen gas.

The Yale lab of Andre Taylor, associate professor of chemical and environmental engineering, has identified a molecule known as heme that could function as a better catalyst. The researchers demonstrated that the heme molecule improved the Li-O2 cell function by lowering the amount of energy required to improve the battery's charge/discharge cycle times.

The results appear in Nature Communications. The lead author is Won-Hee Ryu, a former postdoctoral researcher in Taylor's lab, who is now an assistant professor of chemical and biological engineering at Sookmyung Women's University in South Korea.

The heme is a molecule that makes up one of the two parts of a hemoglobin, which carries oxygen in the blood of animals. Used in an Li-O2 battery, Ryu explained, the molecule would dissolve into the battery's electrolytes and act as what's known as a redox mediator, which lowers the energy barrier required for the electrochemical reaction to take place.

"When you breathe in air, the heme molecule absorbs oxygen from the air to your lungs and when you exhale, it transports carbon dioxide back out," Taylor said. "So it has a good binding with oxygen, and we saw this as a way to enhance these promising lithium-air batteries."

The researchers added that their discovery could help reduce the amount of animal waste disposal.

"We're using a biomolecule that traditionally is just wasted," said Taylor. "In the animal products industry, they have to figure out some way to dispose of the blood. Here, we can take the heme molecules from these waste products and use it for renewable energy storage."

Introduction

A whiff of pool water - often described as the smell of chlorine -can stir happy thoughts of summer. If strong enough, however, "pool smell" can signify a source of irritation to the eyes, lungs and skin of swimmers.

Pool smell is due, not to chlorine, but to chloramines, chemical compounds that build up in pool water when it is improperly treated.

Chloramines result from the combination of two ingredients: (a) chlorine disinfectants and (b) perspiration, oils and urine that enter pools on the bodies of swimmers. Chlorine disinfectants are added to pool water to destroy germs that can give swimmers diarrhea, ear aches and athlete's foot. Perspiration, oils and urine, however, are unwanted additions to pool water. By showering before entering the pool, and washing these substances from the skin, swimmers can help minimize pool smell.

The Chemistry of Pool Smell

When chlorine disinfectants are added to water, two chemicals are unleashed that destroy waterborne germs: hypochlorous acid, HOCl, and hypochlorite ion, OCl-. A measure of the chlorine in these two chemicals is known as "free available chlorine" or FAC. Pool operators manage the FAC level of pool water for the safety of swimmers. Their challenge comes from the fact that FAC is reduced when it reacts with perspiration, oils and urine from swimmers to form chloramines.

Three hydrogen ions are found

at the corners of the base of

this pyramid-shaped molecule,

with nitrogen at the top.

One way that chloramines are formed in pool water is by the reaction of hypochlorous acid with ammonia. Ammonia, NH 3, is a component of sweat and urine. Its chemical structure is illustrated in the figure at the right.

There are three chemical reactions that can occur when hypochlorous acid reacts with ammonia, each involving the replacement of hydrogen ions with chlorine ions. When one of ammonia's hydrogen ions is replaced with chlorine, monochloramine is formed:

HOCl + NH 3 → NH 2 Cl + H 2 O

Replacing one more hydrogen ion with chlorine produces dichloramine,

HOCl + NH 2 Cl → NHCl 2 + H 2 O

Finally, it is possible to replace all three of ammonia's hydrogen ions with chlorine to form trichloramine, also known as nitrogen trichloride:

HOCl + NHCl

Connecting the dots makes it possible to deduce the antineutrino’s trajectory. ×

Existing detectors for antineutrinos generated by nuclear reactors and by radioactive beta decay are large devices that record only the total number of particles they capture. Now two physicists propose an antineutrino detector that would record the direction in which captured particles were traveling. They hope to build a meter-sized demonstration device that could detect the intense flux of antineutrinos from a nuclear reactor, making it possible to image the reaction’s intensity. A detector able to map the much weaker emission from radioactivity within the Earth would be large but still potentially practical, they say.

The standard method for detecting antineutrinos relies on inverse beta decay: the antineutrino collides with a proton (usually in hydrogen), converting it into a neutron and a positron that fly off at high speed. A typical detector is a large volume of a hydrogen-rich “scintillator” material, loaded with an element, such as boron, that has a propensity for capturing neutrons. The neutron produced by inverse beta decay initially moves roughly in line with the original path of the antineutrino, but it scatters from

To the researchers' surprise, the organics found around a young star called MWC 480 are not only surviving but thriving in quantities slightly higher than those thought to have existed in the early solar system. The prolific amount of material reveals that Earth's solar system is not the only one to contain these complex molecules, suggesting that the ingredients required for life to evolve may exist throughout the universe. The scientists created a video tour of the star MWC 48 to showcase their discovery

"The very rich organic chemistry present in the young solar system, as evidenced by cometary compositions, is far from unique," lead author Karin Öberg, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Massachusetts, told Space.com by email.

"It thus seems likely that the prebiotic chemistry that took place in the solar system, including Earth, is also happening elsewhere," she said. [Related: Signs of Alien Life Will Be Found by 2025, NASA's Chief Scientist Says]

Building blocks abound

Located in the Taurus star-forming region 455 light-years away from Earth, the star MWC 480 is about twice the mass of the sun and shines nearly 10 times brighter. A disk of material surrounds the million-year-old star, but scientists have not observed any obvious signs of planet formation.

Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), Öberg and her colleagues observed MWC 480, finding enough methyl cyanide (a complex carbon-based molecule) in the disk surrounding the star to fill all of Earth's oceans. They also found a supply of other complex carbon-based molecules.

Volatile elements such as cyanides boil away at high temperatures. Despite this fragility, they are thought to be necessary for life. The carbon-nitrogen bonds of cyanides are especially important, as they are essential to the formation of amino acids, which in turn are the building blocks for proteins.

While astronomers have found simple volatilesin disks around other stars, complex organic molecules such as those spotted by the team have remained more

<|begin_of_text|>Today’s post looks at an aspect of chemistry we come across every day: alloys. Alloys make up parts of buildings, transport, coins, and plenty of other objects in our daily lives. But what are the different alloys we use made up of, and why do we use them instead of elemental metals? The graphic answers the first of these questions, and in the post we’ll try and answer the second.

First, a little on what alloys are, for anyone unfamiliar with the term. Alloys are a mixture of elements, where at least one of the elements is a metal. There are over 80 metals in the periodic table of elements, and we can mix selections of these different metals in varying proportions, sometimes with non-metals too, to create alloys. Note the use of the word mixture: in the vast majority of cases, alloys are simply intermixed elements, rather than elements that are chemically bonded together.

Alloys can be simply classified in terms of their atomic arrangements. In cases where the two elements being mixed to make the alloy have similar atom sizes, atoms of the second element can simply take the place of atoms of the first element in the structure. These types of alloys are called substitution alloys. On the other hand, if the atoms of the second element are much smaller, they can slot into the gaps between atoms of the first element. These alloys are known as interstitial alloys. Alloys can be made in a number of ways, but they are primarily fashioned by mixing together the molten components.

There are a great range of alloys; the main graphic illustrates just a small selection of those that we use in a range of applications. But why use them in the first place when there are so many different metals with varying properties in the periodic table? Whilst metallic elements may have desirable properties, unfortunately they rarely have them in convenient combinations. Gold is shiny and, well, golden, but it’s also quite soft, meaning if you try and make a ring from pure gold, it’ll deform easily. Iron is present in many buildings, but on its own it too is a little on the soft side, and also has a tendency to rust when exposed to damp air.

Making alloys is essentially a way for us to ‘tweak’ the properties of a metal, to make them closer to the ideal properties we want for a particular purpose. Alloying gold with copper or silver makes it harder, whilst alloying iron with carbon and a selection of other metals accomplishes a similar effect, and also helps prevent it

[Take two] long pieces of four-edged wood, and on each piece write a Pater noster, on each side down to the end. Lay one on the floor of the barn, and lay the other across it, so that they form the sign of the cross. And take four pieces of the hallowed bread which is blessed on Lammas day, and crumble them at the four corners of the barn. This is the blessing for that; so that mice do not harm these sheaves, say prayers over the sheaves and do not cease from saying them. 'City of Jerusalem, where mice do not live they cannot have power, and cannot gather the grain, nor rejoice with the harvest.' This is the second blessing: 'Lord God Almighty, who made heaven and earth, bless these fruits in the name of the Father and the Holy Spirit.' Amen. And [then say] a Pater Noster.

A new look at data from the Mars Viking landers concludes that the two landers may have found the building blocks of life on the Red Planet after all way back in 1976. The surprise discovery of perchlorates by the Phoenix mission on Mars 32 years later could mean the way the Viking experiment was set up actually would have destroyed any carbon-based chemical building blocks of life – what the experiment set about to try and find.

“This doesn’t say anything about the question of whether or not life has existed on Mars, but it could make a big difference in how we look for evidence to answer that question,” said Chris McKay of NASA’s Ames Research Center. McKay coauthored a study published online by the Journal of Geophysical Research – Planets, reanalyzing results of Viking’s tests for organic chemicals in Martian soil.

The Viking lander scooped up some soil, put it in a tiny oven and heated the sample. The only organic chemicals identified in the Martian soil from that experiment chloromethane and dichloromethane — chlorine compounds interpreted at the time as likely contaminants from cleaning fluids used on the spacecraft before it left Earth. But those chemicals are exactly what the new study found when a little perchlorate — the surprise finding from Phoenix — was added to desert soil from Chile containing organics and analyzed in the manner of the Viking tests.

“Our results suggest that not only organics, but also perchlorate, may have been present in the soil at both Viking landing sites,” said the study’s lead author, Rafael Navarro-González of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City.

The Viking experiment results have been rather controversial over the years. There are some scientists who say the experiment actually did find evidence for life, and others who say the results were inconclusive.

McKay said that organics can come from non-biological or biological sources. Many meteorites raining onto Mars and Earth for the past 5 billion years contain organics. Even if Mars has never had life, scientists before Viking anticipated that Martian soil would contain organics from meteorites.

“The lack of organics was a big surprise from the Vikings,” McKay said. “But for 30 years we were looking at a jigsaw puzzle with a piece missing. Phoenix has provided the missing piece: perchlorate. The perchlorate discovery by Phoenix was one of the most important results from Mars since Viking.” Perchlorate, an ion of chlorine and oxygen, becomes a strong oxidant when heated. “

The finding indicates what organic molecules might be found on Titan, the moon of Saturn that scientists think is a model for the chemistry of pre-life Earth.

Earth and Titan are the only known planetary-sized bodies that have thick, predominantly nitrogen atmospheres, said Hiroshi Imanaka, who conducted the research while a member of UA's chemistry and biochemistry department.

How complex organic molecules become nitrogenated in settings like early Earth or Titan's atmosphere is a big mystery, Imanaka said.

"Titan is so interesting because its nitrogen-dominated atmosphere and organic chemistry might give us a clue to the origin of life on our Earth," said Imanaka, now an assistant research scientist in the UA's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. "Nitrogen is an essential element of life."

However, not just any nitrogen will do. Nitrogen gas must be converted to a more chemically active form of nitrogen that can drive the reactions that form the basis of biological systems.

Imanaka and Mark Smith converted a nitrogen-methane gas mixture similar to Titan's atmosphere into a collection of nitrogen-containing organic molecules by irradiating the gas with high-energy UV rays. The laboratory set-up was designed to mimic how solar radiation affects Titan's atmosphere.

Most of the nitrogen moved directly into solid compounds, rather than gaseous ones, said Smith, a UA professor and head of chemistry and biochemistry. Previous models predicted the nitrogen would move from gaseous compounds to solid ones in a lengthier stepwise process.

Titan looks orange in color because a smog of organic molecules envelops the planet. The particles in the smog will eventually settle down to the surface and may be exposed to conditions that could create life, said Imanaka, who is also a principal investigator at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif.

However, scientists don't know whether Titan's smog particles contain nitrogen. If some of the particles are the same nitrogen-containing organic molecules the UA team created in the laboratory, conditions conducive to life are more likely, Smith said.

Laboratory observations such as these indicate what the next space missions should look for and what instruments should be developed to help in the search, Smith said.

Imanaka and Smith's paper, "Formation of nitrogenated organic aerosols in the Titan upper atmosphere," is scheduled for publication in the Early Online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences the week of June 28

We have shown previously that FNDC5, a type I transmembrane protein, and its circulating form, irisin, convey some of these benefits in mice. However, recent reports questioned the existence of circulating human irisin both because human FNDC5 has a non-canonical ATA translation start and because of claims that many human irisin antibodies used in commercial ELISA kits lack required specificity. In this paper we have identified and quantitated human irisin in plasma using mass spectrometry with control peptides enriched with heavy stable isotopes as internal standards. This precise state-of-the-art method shows that human irisin is mainly translated from its non-canonical start codon and circulates at ∼3.6 ng/ml in sedentary individuals; this level is increased to ∼4.3 ng/ml in individuals undergoing aerobic interval training. These data unequivocally demonstrate that human irisin exists, circulates, and is regulated by exercise.

Human FNDC5 has an atypical translation start codon, ATA, in place of the more typical ATG. While it is now known that many eukaryotic mRNAs begin translation with non-ATG start codons (), two recent papers have claimed that this ATA codon in human FNDC5 represents a null mutation and therefore human irisin would not be produced (). These authors argue that if FNDC5 exists in humans, it is translated from a downstream ATG, and hence the irisin polypeptide is a “myth” and does not exist. In addition, these authors claim that the many papers measuring human irisin are all artifacts of poor antibody specificity (); this is despite the fact that Lee et al. had previously detected an irisin peptide in human plasma with mass spectrometry (). In this paper we have investigated the presence of human irisin in blood using quantitative mass spectrometry. As internal standards, we synthesized irisin peptides and included a valine enriched in stable isotopes (sixC atoms). The peptides were used to develop a quantitative platform for the measurement of human irisin; these data should facilitate future studies of this molecule in both mice and humans.

The health benefits of physical activity and exercise are well recognized (). Exercise is the first line of therapy for various metabolic diseases like diabetes and obesity, but exercise also improves outcomes in diseases involving other tissues, such as the heart and brain.

“It is an entirely different way of putting molecules together,” Davies said. “And that means it allows you ready access to compounds that have either never been made before, or that were impractical to be made by the conventional methods.”

This international collaboration of scientists is redesigning how organic chemicals are made. Every organic chemical has a basic framework made up of carbon and hydrogen. When chemists make new drugs, for example, they build on those existing frameworks.

But what if you could break open that framework? You could build new chemical structures into the framework, Davies said, opening up new possibilities for drugs and other organic chemicals.

It will also make some chemicals cleaner and cheaper to make, said Daniel Morton, managing director of the Center for Selective C-H Functionalization. By changing how chemicals are made, scientists can eliminate toxic byproducts and waste.

“I think in every field of science one of the biggest drives in the last 20 years has been how to do things in a cleaner, more effective and efficient fashion,” he said. “And that’s what this center is all about.”

For how long is the ionosphere affected by a solar eclipse?

What causes these spatial and temporal scales? Methodology Illuminate the ionosphere with an Eclipse QSO Party.

Use networks such as the Reverse Beacon Network to collect data.

Use amateur radio data to complement data from other sources.

Introduction

On 21 August 2017, a total solar eclipse will cause the shadow of the moon to traverse the United States from Oregon to South Carolina in just over 90 minutes. As shown in Figure 1, this will be the one of most significant solar eclipses traversing the continental United States for 100 years. While solar eclipses are perhaps best known for their stunning visual display, the shadow of an eclipse also causes changes to the ionosphere which effect radio wave propagation and are useful for the study of ionospheric physics. For a summary of ionspheric radio effects as measured during the 1999 United Kingdom Total Solar Eclipse, please see Bamford 2000.

Although the ionospheric effects of solar eclipses have been studied for over 50 years, many unanswered questions remain. Some include, “How much of the ionosphere is affected by the solar eclipse, and for how long? Why is this the case?” HamSCI is inviting amateur radio operators to participate in a large-scale experiment which will characterize the ionospheric response to the 21 August 2017 total solar eclipse and target these open questions in ionospheric physics.

Figure 1: Total solar eclipses visible in the US from 1950 to 2052. The 2017 eclipse (red triangles) will have an exceptionally long footprint in the heart of the continental US.

Background

The ionosphere is produced when solar ultra violet (UV) and x-ray radiation cause neutral atoms and molecules in the Earth’s atmosphere to be stripped of negative electrons. This creates a type of gas known as a plasma, which is made of both positively and negatively charged particles. After a certain amount of time, some of these particles recombine to form neutrals again. When solar radiation is present, ionospheric production and loss processes occur simultaneously creating a strong ionosphere. When solar radiation is absent, loss processes dominate and the ionosphere becomes weaker. These effects are most commonly observed as a result of the day-night (diurnal) cycle. Figure 2 shows examples of typical day and night ionospheric profiles generated using the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) empirical

These bands are formed by sheets of microscopic carbides within a tempered martensite or pearlite matrix in higher carbon steel, or by ferrite and pearlite banding in lower carbon steels. It was a pioneering steel alloy developed in Southern India in the 6th century BC and exported globally. It was also known in the ancient world by many different names including Ukku, Hindvi Steel, Hinduwani Steel, Teling Steel and Seric Iron.

History [ edit ]

Wootz steel originated in South India, in Tamilakam present day Tamil Nadu and Kerala.[1][2] There are several ancient Tamil, Greek, Chinese and Roman literary references to high carbon Tamil steel. The crucible steel production process started in the 6th century BC, at production sites of Kodumanal in Tamil Nadu, Golconda in Telangana, Karnataka and Sri Lanka and exported globally; the Tamils of the Chera Dynasty producing what was termed the finest steel in the world, i.e. Seric Iron to the Romans, Egyptians, Chinese and Arabs by 500 BC.[3][4][5] The steel was exported as cakes of steely iron that came to be known as "Wootz".[6] Wootz steel in India had high amount of carbon in it.

The Tamilakam method was to heat black magnetite ore in the presence of carbon in a sealed clay crucible inside a charcoal furnace to completely remove slag. An alternative was to smelt the ore first to give wrought iron, then heat and hammer it to remove slag. The carbon source was bamboo and leaves from plants such as Avārai.[6][7] The Chinese and locals in Sri Lanka adopted the production methods of creating wootz steel from the Chera Tamils by the 5th century BC.[8][9] In Sri Lanka, this early steel-making method employed a unique wind furnace, driven by the monsoon winds. Production sites from antiquity have emerged, in places such as Anuradhapura, Tissamaharama and Samanalawewa, as well as imported artifacts of ancient iron and steel from Kodumanal. A 200 BC Tamil trade guild in Tissamaharama, in the South East of Sri Lanka, brought with them some of the oldest iron and steel artifacts and production processes to the island from the classical period.[10][11][12][13]

Glycine (symbol Gly or G;[4] )[5] is the amino acid that has a single hydrogen atom as its side chain. It is the simplest possible amino acid. The chemical formula of glycine is NH 2 ‐CH 2 ‐COOH. Glycine is one of the proteinogenic amino acids, and is notable as the only one that is achiral. It is encoded by all the codons starting with GG (GGU, GGC, GGA, GGG). Glycine is also known as a "helix breaker".

Glycine is a colorless, sweet-tasting crystalline solid. It is the only achiral proteinogenic amino acid. It can fit into hydrophilic or hydrophobic environments, due to its minimal side chain of only one hydrogen atom. The acyl radical is glycyl.

Glycine is a white crystalline solid

History and etymology [ edit ]

Glycine was discovered in 1820 by the French chemist Henri Braconnot when he hydrolyzed gelatin by boiling it with sulfuric acid.[6] He originally called it "sugar of gelatin",[7][8] but the French chemist Jean-Baptiste Boussingault showed that it contained nitrogen.[9] The American scientist Eben Norton Horsford, then a student of the German chemist Justus von Liebig, proposed the name "glycocoll";[10][11] however, the Swedish chemist Berzelius suggested the simpler name "glycine".[12][13] The name comes from the Greek word γλυκύς "sweet tasting"[14] (which is also related to the prefixes glyco- and gluco-, as in glycoprotein and glucose). In 1858, the French chemist Auguste Cahours determined that glycine was an amine of acetic acid.[15]

Production [ edit ]

Although glycine can be isolated from hydrolyzed protein, this is not used for industrial production, as it can be manufactured more conveniently by chemical synthesis.[16] The two main processes are amination of chloroacetic acid with ammonia, giving glycine and ammonium chloride,[17] and the Strecker amino acid synthesis,[18] which is the main synthetic method in the United States and Japan.[19] About 15 thousand tonnes are produced annually in this

The waiter takes the money to the chef who recognizes the three as friends and asks the waiter to return $5 to the men. The waiter is not only poor at mathematics but dishonest and instead of going to the trouble of splitting the $5 between the three he simply gives them $1 each and pockets the remaining $2 for himself. Now, each of the men effectively paid $4, the total paid is therefore $12. Add the $2 in the waiters pocket and this comes to $14.....where has the other $1 gone from the original $15? Show Solution Solution: The payments should equal the receipts. It does not make sense to add what was paid by the men ($12) to what was received from that payment by the waiter ($2) Although the initial bill was $15 dollars, one of the five dollar notes gets changed into five ones. The total the three men ultimately paid is $12, as they get three ones back. So from the $12 the men paid, the owner receives $10 and the waiter receives the $2 difference. $15 - $3 = $10 + $2.

What's in a name? For the Greek god of the sun, Helios.

Say what? Helium is pronounced as HEE-lee-em.

History and Uses:

Helium, the second most abundant element in the universe, was discovered on the sun before it was found on the earth. Pierre-Jules-César Janssen, a French astronomer, noticed a yellow line in the sun's spectrum while studying a total solar eclipse in 1868. Sir Norman Lockyer, an English astronomer, realized that this line, with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometers, could not be produced by any element known at the time. It was hypothesized that a new element on the sun was responsible for this mysterious yellow emission. This unknown element was named helium by Lockyer.

The hunt to find helium on earth ended in 1895. Sir William Ramsay, a Scottish chemist, conducted an experiment with a mineral containing uranium called clevite. He exposed the clevite to mineral acids and collected the gases that were produced. He then sent a sample of these gases to two scientists, Lockyer and Sir William Crookes, who were able to identify the helium within it. Two Swedish chemists, Nils Langlet and Per Theodor Cleve, independently found helium in clevite at about the same time as Ramsay.

Helium makes up about 0.0005% of the earth's atmosphere. This trace amount of helium is not gravitationally bound to the earth and is constantly lost to space. The earth's atmospheric helium is replaced by the decay of radioactive elements in the earth's crust. Alpha decay, one type of radioactive decay, produces particles called alpha particles. An alpha particle can become a helium atom once it captures two electrons from its surroundings. This newly formed helium can eventually work its way to the atmosphere through cracks in the crust.

So when the Japanese reporters write about the US reaction (if any) to the law, they try their best to elicit the response they want to hear; failing that, they still hear what they want to hear and write about what they believe they hear. In other words, they goalseek.

First it was Mainichi Shinbun (12/7/2013) who reported on the US reaction to the passage of the State Secret Protection Law:

ハーフ副報道官は「情報の保全は同盟国間の協力に決定的な役割を果たす」と述べ、日米両政府が共有する情報の保全が必要であるとの認識を示した。ただ、ハーフ氏は「表現の自由、報道の自由などの普遍的価値の共有が我々の同盟関係の基盤である」とも述べ、同法を根拠に言論の自由を制限することがないよう日本政府に求めた。

Deputy Spokesperson Harf said "Information security plays a critical role in alliance cooperation," indicating security of information shared by both the Japanese government and the US government is necessary. However, [Ms.] Harf also said, "A foundation of our alliance is a shared commitment to universal values such as freedom of expression and freedom of the press," by which remark she requested the Japanese government not to limit the freedom of speech based on the [State Secrecy Protection] Law.

Thus, according to Mainichi, the US Obama administration has expressed concern that the Japanese government may restrict freedom of speech under the law.

That's odd, I thought, coming from this US administration.

Then, the Asahi Shinbun reporter whom I follow on Twitter tweeted about part of the US State Department Press Briefing on December 6, 2013, which concerned the State Secrecy Protection Law that passed the Opper House on December 6 (Japan Standard Time) and became the law of the land. He said:

“Certainly this is the requested item that the client is seeking for. As I thought he died....... ”

“Yes......”

The quest Roel and I took today was enough to make us feel dejected.

We were to search for a comrade of an Adventurer that failed escape here in this town but at the end what we found was a corpse that was cruelly eaten and scattered around.

It looked like a marriage ring, and hearing the cries from the person’s family made my chest tighten.

I understand how they feel, seeing their reaction to this.

We can’t give up being adventurers.

Along the way in our quest Roel leveled up by 1 but she wasn’t happy.

Once we completed our quest, we checked our levels at the iron box. But like before my level didn’t show itself.

Yesterday, I had tried asking Gantetsu about the one-winged demon when we were parting.

“I have been doing this job for years but I haven’t heard anything about it. Regarding the attack on Ikana Village, the truth is we don’t completely understand what happened. Probably since it sort of happened in the blink of an eye.”

*Scrtchscrtch*

While scratching his beard, Gantetsu continued.

“I don’t understand the nature of that one-winged guy. Is there some sort of reason why he has only one wing? I think knowing that would be relatively important.”

A step closer to affordable water desalination

The defence contractor, Lockheed Martin, has reported a new method for desalination that is vastly cheaper and more efficient, using nanotechnology.

Lockheed Martin has been awarded a patent for "Perforene" – a new molecular filtration system that is designed to meet the growing global demand for potable water. This material works by removing sodium, chlorine and other ions from seawater and other sources.

Dr. Ray Johnson, senior vice president and chief technology officer: "Access to clean drinking water is going to become more critical as the global population continues to grow, and we believe that this simple and affordable solution will be a game-changer for the industry. Perforene... is just one example of Lockheed Martin's efforts to apply some of the advanced materials that we have developed for our core markets, including aircraft and spacecraft, to global environmental and economic challenges."

According to a UN report last year, over 780 million people around the world do not have access to clean drinking water. Tom Notaro, Lockheed business manager for advanced materials: "One of the areas that we're very concerned about in terms of global security is the access to clean and affordable drinking water. As more and more countries become more developed... access to that water for their daily lives is becoming more and more critical."

Perforene was developed by placing holes that are one nanometre or less in a membrane of graphene. These are small enough to trap ions while dramatically improving the flow-through of water molecules, reducing clogging and pressure. Being just one atom thick, graphene is both strong and durable, making it far more effective at sea water desalination at a fraction of the cost of traditional reverse osmosis systems.

John Stetson, senior engineer: "It's 500 times thinner than the best filter on the market today and 1,000 times stronger. The energy that's required and the pressure that's required to filter salt is approximately 100 times less."

In addition to desalination, the Perforene membrane can be tailored to other applications – including capturing minerals, through the selection of the size of hole placed in the material to filter or capture a specific size particle of interest. Lockheed Martin has also been developing processes that will allow the material to be produced at scale. The company is now seeking commercialisation partners.

Running 46 minutes late because of a last-second technical snag, the 1.6-million-pound Atlas 5, equipped with three strap-on solid-fuel boosters for extra power, roared to life at 2:13 p.m. EST (GMT-5) and quickly lifted off from launch complex 41 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, arcing away to the east under a mostly clear sky.

Rapidly accelerating as it consumed its liquid oxygen and kerosene propellants, the 194-foot-tall rocket put on a weekend show for area residents, beachgoers and tourists, leaving a long trail of exhaust in its wake as it climbed out of the dense lower atmosphere and disappeared from view.

The Russian-built RD-180 engine powering the first stage chalked up an apparently flawless performance, handing off to the rocket’s Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10C Centaur second stage engine a little more than four-and-a-half minutes after launch.

As planned, the hydrogen-fueled Centaur engine fired twice and 32 minutes after launch, the 14,914-pound relay station was released from the second stage into a so-called “supersynchronous” orbit with a low point of 127 miles and a high point of around 40,389 miles.

EchoStar 19’s on-board propulsion system will be used to circularize the orbit at an altitude of 22,300 miles above the equator where spacecraft take 24 hours to complete one trip around the planet. In such geosynchronous orbits, satellites appear to hang stationary in the sky, allowing the use of fixed antennas on the ground.

EchoStar operates a fleet of two dozen solely owned, leased and managed relay stations. EchoStar 19, built by Space Systems Loral, will be stationed over North America to provide high-speed broadband internet service from HughesNet, an EchoStar subsidiary that currently serves more than a million customers with two existing satellites -- EchoStar 17 and Spaceway 3.

Along with providing service to rural areas not wired for broadband, EchoStar 19 also will provide 200 megabits-per-second access to passenger jets.

Forfeit: Part of the national anthem, La Cucaracha, other traditional American or Mexican songs a Briton might know.

Answer: "Shave and a Haircut." (

Notes: In America (and I think in the UK, too?), the tune can end a song, or you could knock on a door to its rhythm. It was common in old cartoons and was a plot point in the movie "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" where the cartoon rabbit couldn't stay hidden since all someone had to do was hum "shave and a haircut" to make him respond "two bits."

The traditional American lyrics are "Shave and a haircut, two bits." As was said in Series E, "two bits" used to mean 25 cents because the Spanish dollar coin, which was used in America about 200 years ago, was cut into 1/8th slices called "bits." Contrary to what was said in Series E, it's not really used to mean a quarter anymore, and the term persists only in the "Shave and a Haircut" lyrics and as an insulting adjective that simply means "inferior."

In Mexico, however, the lyrics are a lot stronger: "Chinga (a) tu madre, cabron!" (The "a" is slurred with "chinga" so that you don't really hear it.) The translation is roughly, "Go f--k your mother, a--hole!" Most Americans have no clue about the Mexican version, and vice-versa, which could lead to quite an interesting misunderstanding. In Mexico, you can honk your horn to the five-note rhythm instead of using your middle finger. And if you knocked it on a door, it would be like saying, "Open the door, a--hole!" The origin is unclear, but the lyrics are known widely enough to offend.

Production notes: If nobody gets it, Fry could tap the first five notes on the table to see if anyone taps the next two. Then he could ask if they know the lyrics.

<|begin_of_text|>This article is about a kind of wig worn by Korean women. For the cake, see Guernsey Gâche

The gache (Hangul: 가체; Hanja: 加髢) is a big wig worn by Korean women. Women of high social backgrounds and kisaeng wore them. Like their western contemporaries Koreans considered bigger and heavier wigs to be more aesthetically pleasing.[1] However, there is a record of an incident where a heavy gache wig led to the death of a 13-year-old bride as the heavy wig compromised her neck as she was getting up to greet her father-in-law entering the room. Also due to its costliness, some lower-class families took up to 6–7 years preparing a new gache wig for their new daughter-in-law.[2]

The gache also flourished in Goryeo, the Three Kingdoms, Balhae, the Gaya confederacy, and Gojoseon. They were decorated with silk objects, gold, jewels, silver, coral, jade, etc. Certain decorations were reserved for royalty.

Such was the women's frenzy for the gache that in 1788, King Jeongjo of Joseon prohibited and banned by royal decree the use of gache as they were deemed contrary to Confucian values of reserve and restraint.[3] In the 19th century, yangban women began to wear jokduri, a small hat that substituted for the gache. However gache still enjoyed vast popularity in kisaeng circles and traditional weddings. Inclusive of its decorations, a gache usually weighs about 3 to 4 kg.

<|begin_of_text|>José Mourinho has admitted Chelsea are 'a club missing a striker' but while he ruled out the possibility of signing Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the summer, he did drop a hint that his club could be interested in another forward currently playing in France, Radamel Falcao.

Mourinho said that persuading Paris St Germain to part with Ibrahimovic was "mission impossible", but admitted that Falcao was a player he is interested in, suggesting the Colombian forward's current club Monaco, now managed by Mourinho's Chelsea predecessor Claudio Ranieri, are not big enough for a player of his stature.

After his stellar scoring form at Atlético Madrid and previously at Mourinho's former club Porto, Falcao was one of Europe's hottest properties last summer, but the 28-year-old surprisingly opted to join Monaco in a £50m deal.

"The problem at Chelsea is that we are missing a striker. I have one in [Samuel] Eto'o but he is 32, possibly 35, who knows?", Mourinho joked in an interview with the French television station Canal Plus, before adding. "I don't have Falcao but Falcao doesn't have a club. Who wants to play in front of 3,000 supporters? If I was one day to go to Monaco it would be the end."

Falcao is currently out of action due to a serious knee injury but should recover in time to play for Colombia at the World Cup finals in Brazil.

When asked about the possibility of Chelsea moving for the Swede Ibrahimovic, Mourinho said: "It's impossible. He is happy in Paris, I know because we are friends and we have some contact. PSG, with their economic potential, would never want to open the door. It's mission impossible."

Mourinho also rejected suggestions that Eden Hazard could be tempted to swap London for Paris and join PSG. "Eden is our boy," he added. "We want him to stay for 10 years. We want to build the team around him. He's a player with the style of football that we want to have in our team."<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>In thermodynamics, the triple point of a substance is the temperature and pressure at which the three phases (gas, liquid, and solid) of that substance coexist in thermodynamic equilibrium.[1] It is that temperature and pressure at which the sublimation curve, fusion curve and the vaporisation curve meet. For example, the triple point of mercury occurs at a temperature of −38.83440 °C and a pressure of 0.2 mPa.

In addition to the triple point for solid, liquid, and gas phases, a triple point may involve more than one solid phase, for substances with multiple polymorphs. Helium-4 is a special case that presents a triple point involving two different fluid phases (lambda point).[1]

The triple point of water was used to define the kelvin, the base unit of thermodynamic temperature in the International System of Units (SI).[2] The value of the triple point of water was fixed by definition, rather than measured, but that changed with the 2019 redefinition of SI base units. The triple points of several substances are used to define points in the ITS-90 international temperature scale, ranging from the triple point of hydrogen (13.8033 K) to the triple point of water (273.16 K, 0.01 °C, or 32.018 °F).

The term "triple point" was coined in 1873 by James Thomson, brother of Lord Kelvin.[3]

The single combination of pressure and temperature at which liquid water, solid ice, and water vapor can coexist in a stable equilibrium occurs at exactly 273.1600 K (0.0100 °C; 32.0180 °F) and a partial vapor pressure of 611.657 pascals (6.11657 mbar; 0.00603659 atm).[4][5] At that point, it is possible to change all of the substance to ice, water, or vapor by making arbitrarily small changes in pressure and temperature. Even if the total pressure of a system is well above the triple point of water, provided that the partial pressure of the water vapor is 611.657 pascals, then the system can still be brought to the triple point of water.

But the near-fainting spell was in fact due to dehydration, exacerbated by her condition. Her husband Bill Clinton said Monday that it wasn’t the first time. “Rarely, but on more than one occasion, over the last many, many years, the same sort of thing’s happened to her where she just got severely dehydrated,” he said.

Politico reports, citing unnamed sources, that Clinton is chronically dehydrated, and that her reluctance to regularly drink water has become a “source of tension” between the candidate and her staff. “She won’t drink water, and you try telling Hillary Clinton she has to drink water,” a source in close contact with the Democratic candidate said. Politico described a hectic rehydration mission which included lots of bottles of water as well as Gatorade.

In 2013, CBS reported that some 75% of Americans may be functioning in a chronic state of dehydration, many mistaking the symptoms for other illnesses. Whether she’s among them or not, the Democratic nominee might be better off taking a big gulp next time a staff member approaches with a glass of water.

Why do we get dehydrated?

Dehydration occurs when your body loses more fluid than you take in, upsetting its balance of salts and sugar, which affects the way it functions. Water makes up between 60-70% of average adult— and it’s important to keep levels stable. Water is essential for life and our body uses it in many different ways, from lubricating joints and regulating our temperature to enabling waste removal via sweating, bowel movements and urination.

If not treated immediately, chronic – or ongoing – dehydration can lead to serious medical complications; it can affect your kidney function, increase the risk of kidney stones and lead to muscle damage and constipation. This level of dehydration requires hospital treatment where a sufferer will be attached to a drip to restore fluids. Of patients treated for kidney stones, 50% are likely to have a recurrence within ten years.

How do we get dehydrated?

Usually, by not drinking enough fluid – usually water – to replace what you lose.

(CNN) — The Hubble space telescope peers hundreds, thousands, millions of light years into the universe to study novas, quasars and nebulas.

But weeks ago, it pulled its focus way in close — to just light minutes away — to view a rare and beautiful spectacle at the planet Jupiter.

Three big moons crossed past it at the same time, casting their shadows onto Jupiter’s swirling surface.

From the perspective of people theoretically standing down on Jupiter, it would be like three solar eclipses happening at once, astronomers said.

A photo gift

In the last 15 years, this has happened only twice, the Space Telescope Science Institute said. “The next one will be 2032,” said astronomer Carol Christian.

So, Hubble shot photos rapid fire to capture the rare conjunction in late January. And STScI published them on Thursday, along with a short fast-motion video animation.

There was no great scientific gain in Hubble taking the snaps. The moons and their crossings have been examined plenty and are well known.

“We felt that there are images which have aesthetic value above and beyond their scientific value,” said astronomer Zolt Levy.

It was a gift of beauty to the public.

62 moons, 4 big ones

Jupiter is a sort of mini-solar system inside our solar system.

It’s the largest body after the sun. And like the sun, it comprises a lot of helium and hydrogen gas, but it doesn’t have enough mass to burst into the intense nuclear fusion that makes the sun a fireball, NASA says.

It has many satellites, including 62 moons, and they swarm around the planet with many of them crossing the surface facing Earth constantly.

But only four of them are highly visible standouts. They are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.

Just like Galileo

The four moons are called the Galilean satellites, because Renaissance astronomer Galileo Galilei discovered them in 1610, when he pointed his telescope skyward, forever changing human perception of our place in the cosmos.

Many of today’s hobby telescopes are much stronger than his, so anyone can easily follow in his footsteps and cast the same gaze.

And many did, when the three moons passed, posting their recordings of the triple moon transit on YouTube.

The idea that liquid water exists below the surface of one of Saturn’s moons has been given a boost thanks to researchers in the US and China who have detected ammonia, various organic compounds, and possibly argon in plumes of gas and ice particles that spew out of the moon’s south pole.

The work should help scientists further understand the formation of this and other planetary bodies and keeps hope alive that Enceladus, Saturn’s sixth largest moon, might have the necessary components to support extraterrestrial life.

When plumes of ice water were first observed erupting from Enceladus by NASA’s Cassini spacecraft in 2005, scientists immediately began to wonder if they were being propelled by liquid water present in the moon’s interior. Now, Jack Hunter Waite Jr and colleagues from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, US, and a number of other institutions in the US and Taiwan have added to mounting evidence in support of this theory by analysing INMS (ion neutral mass spectrometer) data on the plumes’ gas constituents obtained from a recent Cassini flyby.

’Our evidence [for liquid water] comes from the detection of ammonia which acts as an antifreeze and can lower the melting point of water ice,’ explains Jonathan Lunine, one of the paper’s co-authors and a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson, US.

Moreover, the team believe their analysis points to an abundance of an isotope of argon (40Ar) in the plumes. The most plausible explanation for its presence, they say, is that a fluid must be leaching either the 40Ar or its parent potassium out of the rock deep inside Enceladus’ interior. ’Ice doesn’t do that so it really should be liquid,’ adds Lunine.

Growing support

Last month, German scientists, led by Frank Postberg from the University of Heidelberg, put forward strong evidence for subsurface liquid water by publishing their discovery of sodium salts in Saturn’s outer-most ring which is thought to originate from Enceladus’ plume material. ’The two studies are complimentary and now, for the first time, we are getting an idea of the full picture of what’s happening on Enceladus,’ says Postberg.

Also excited about the new findings is Dave Stegman from the University of Melbourne in Australia, who has previously hypothes

<|begin_of_text|>Mars scientists today nominated eight enticing targets for NASA’s next rover, due for launch in 2020. More than 100 planetary scientists narrowed down a list of 21 sites with a vote at the conclusion of a 3-day workshop in Monrovia, California. The researchers were keen to find sites that could preserve signs of life in rocks which would be sampled by the rover and, they hope, eventually returned to Earth.

The top vote getter was Jezero crater, which contains a relic river delta that could have concentrated and preserved organic molecules. “The appeal is twofold,” says Bethany Ehlmann, a planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena. “Not only is there a delta, but the rocks upstream are varied and diverse.”

Second on the list was Columbia Hills, a region explored by the rover Spirit before it expired in 2010. Spirit found silica deposits that may have been deposited by a hydrothermal system—one that could have nourished life billions of years ago.

Several other favored sites sit at the edge of Isidis Basin, an impact structure that created deep troughs with significant carbonate deposits, which could help explain how Mars lost its once-thick carbon dioxide atmosphere. That atmosphere “was either lost to space, or it has to be sequestered down in the rock as carbonates,” Ehlmann says. “We can explore one of those paths.”

The new $1.5 billion rover will be very similar to Curiosity, which has been exploring Gale crater since 2012. But there are key differences. The main one is that the 2020 rover is expected to drill and collect more than 30 pencil-sized rock cores to be stored in a sample “cache.” Later missions could then land a small rover that would fetch and deliver the cache to a rocket that would return the samples to Earth for analysis.

The 2020 rover also has a slimmed down payload compared to Curiosity. It won’t have, for instance, a mass spectrometer analysis instrument of the type that has at times bogged down Curiosity. That should enable mission scientists to assemble a cache more quickly. The “sky crane” system, which delivered Curiosity to the surface, will also be used again, though engineers are considering enhancements that could allow zones of confident targeting to shrink by more than 50%, to ellipses as small as 13 kilometers by 7 kilometers.

<|begin_of_text|>Wood gas is a syngas fuel which can be used as a fuel for furnaces, stoves and vehicles in place of gasoline, diesel or other fuels. During the production process biomass or other carbon-containing materials are gasified within the oxygen-limited environment of a wood gas generator to produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide. These gases can then be burnt as a fuel within an oxygen rich environment to produce carbon dioxide, water and heat. In some gasifiers this process is preceded by pyrolysis, where the biomass or coal is first converted to char, releasing methane and tar rich in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

History [ edit ]

A bus, powered by wood gas generated by a gassifier on a trailer, Leeds, England c.1943

The first wood gasifier was apparently built by Gustav Bischof in 1839. The first vehicle powered by wood gas was built by Thomas Hugh Parker in 1901.[1] Around 1900, many cities delivered syngas (centrally produced, typically from coal) to residences. Natural gas began to be used only in 1930.

Wood gas vehicles were used during World War II as a consequence of the rationing of fossil fuels. In Germany alone, around 500,000 "producer gas" vehicles were in use at the end of the war. Trucks, buses, tractors, motorcycles, ships and trains were equipped with a wood gasification unit. In 1942, when wood gas had not yet reached the height of its popularity, there were about 73,000 wood gas vehicles in Sweden,[2] 65,000 in France, 10,000 in Denmark, and almost 8,000 in Switzerland. In 1944, Finland had 43,000 "woodmobiles", of which 30,000 were buses and trucks, 7,000 private vehicles, 4,000 tractors and 600 boats.[3]

Wood gasifiers are still manufactured in China and Russia for automobiles and as power generators for industrial applications. Trucks retrofitted with wood gasifiers are used in North Korea[4] in rural areas, particularly on the roads of the east coast.

(Nanowerk Spotlight) Sp 2 -bonded carbon nanomaterials – such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene – have attracted enormous research interest over the past decades. Due to their superior intrinsic physical properties, such as mechanical strength, electrical and thermal conductivity, these nanocarbons find numerous applications in areas such as catalysis, energy storage or nanocomposites. In addition to these intrinsic physical properties, what makes these materials so attractive are their tunable chemical characters, such as functional groups, doping, and surface modification.

However, the demonstration of their intrinsic physical properties and performances in as-fabricated materials and practical devices has been suffering from the self-aggregation and re-stacking of nanocarbon materials due to strong van der Waals interactions. This prevents the full utilization of the active sites for catalytic reactions.

Researchers consider the rational combination of CNTs and graphene into three-dimensional (3D) hybrids an effective route to amplify the inherent physical properties at the macroscale. From post-treatment methods to in situ growth, various strategies have been explored to fabricate such CNTs/graphene hybrids. Most of these approaches, though, still require barrier layers, which hinders the full demonstration of the excellent properties of these hybrid materials.

By in situ nitrogen doping and structural hybridization of carbon nanotubes and graphene, a team from Tsinghua University, led by professors Qiang Zhang and Fei Wei, have now successfully fabricated nitrogen-doped aligned carbon nanotube/graphene (N-ACNT/G) sandwiches. In this work, aligned CNTs and graphene layers were anchored to each other, constructing a sandwich-like hierarchical architecture with efficient 3D electron transfer pathways and ion diffusion channels.

The researchers have published their findings in Advanced Materials ("Nitrogen-Doped Aligned Carbon Nanotube/Graphene Sandwiches: Facile Catalytic Growth on Bifunctional Natural Catalysts and Their Applications as Scaffolds for High-Rate Lithium-Sulfur Batteries").

High-concentrations of SCP-XXXX which manifest behind human hosts are collectively designated as SCP-XXXX-1. Only one instance of SCP-XXXX-1 has been observed to gestate on a human host at any given time. By consequence, instances of SCP-XXXX-1 behave as individual entities and interact and respond independently of other instances of SCP-XXXX-1. Individuals which act as a host to an SCP-XXXX-1 instance are said to have been 'infected' by an instance of SCP-XXXX-1. SCP-XXXX-1 are nebulous entities which can condense and expand to accommodate for the space behind a human host.

SCP-XXXX has a melting point of 0.56K and a boiling point of 3.09K at STP. SCP-XXXX is an odorless gas that cannot be perceived by the naked eye at any concentration or volume, however; SCP-XXXX is an opaque, black substance in both its solid and liquid form. SCP-XXXX has not been observed to perform chemical bonding with itself or any other elements. Despite this, SCP-XXXX naturally congregates around the backs of human subjects.

Description: SCP-XXXX is the designation given to element-12█ of the periodic table. Unlike any elements which precede it, SCP-XXXX is extremely stable - with no apparent half-life or any known isotopes. Since its discovery, SCP-XXXX has been found to not only exist naturally but also be exceedingly abundant in the Earth's atmosphere.

An international research team discovered the ice in crystalline form on the surface of comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko, Churi for short, indicating that it was formed 4.6 billion years ago — the results of the experiment have been published in the Astrophysical Journal.

The comet, which is part of the planet Jupiter family, has found to have ice crystals on its surface that could have originated in space before the solar system or the sun was formed in conditions described by scientists as protosolar nebula.

By analyzing chemicals trapped in the ice on the comet's surface, researchers were able to determine the age of the ice crystals using a mass spectrometer — which is an instrument that can measure the masses and relative concentrations of atoms and molecules. A statement from the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) said:

"If comets are made of crystalline ice, this means that they must have formed at the same time as the solar system, that than earlier in the interstellar medium."

Before Life Began

The discovery of ice crystals on Churi could have implications on future research surrounding how the earth and solar system began life.

"In October 2014 [the mass spectrometer] first measured amounts of molecular nitrogen (N2), carbon monoxide (CO) and argon (Ar) in Churi's ice," a statement from the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) said.

"The data was compared with that from laboratory experiments on amorphous ice, as well as from models describing the composition of gas hydrates, a type of crystalline ice in which water molecules can trap molecules of gas."

The levels of nitrogen and argon gas in the ice led the researchers to conclude that is had a crystalline structure, suggesting the ice on the surface of the comet could have been formed before the solar system, or even at the same

<|begin_of_text|>One of the two big players in the asteroid mining market, Deep Space Industries, today unveiled its plan to land a 110-pound spacecraft on a near-Earth asteroid by 2020.

The spacecraft, known as Prospector-1, would study the yet-to-be-selected asteroid to determine the value of its resources for mining. It’ll also put Deep Space Industries’ water-based propulsion system to an interplanetary test.

“Deep Space Industries has worked diligently to get to this point, and now we can say with confidence that we have the right technology, the right team and the right plan to execute this historic mission,” Rick Tumlinson, DSI’s board chairman and co-founder, said in a news release.

California-based DSI and its partners in Luxembourg say they’ll launch a precursor satellite called Prospector-X into low Earth orbit next year to test the technologies that would be used for Prospector-1.

DSI sees near-Earth asteroids as potentially valuable sources for materials ranging from plain old water ice – which can be processed into breathable oxygen and drinkable water as well as propellant – to in-space building materials and precious metals.

If DSI sticks to its schedule, Prospector-1 could become the first commercial asteroid mining exploration mission. However, Planetary Resources, which is based in Redmond, Wash., is also taking aim at asteroids.

Planetary Resources had its first precursor spacecraft, Arkyd-3R, deployed into orbit for a five-month test mission last year. A larger spacecraft, the Arkyd-6A, is being readied for launch later this year and will observe Earth in infrared wavelengths as a practice round for asteroid prospecting.

Planetary Resources says its next-generation space telescopes, known as the Arkyd 100 and Arkyd 200, could start studying the composition of near-Earth asteroids in the 2017-2019 time frame. At the same time, the company plans to create a constellation of Earth-observing satellites known as Ceres.

If suitable targets are identified, Planetary Resources could begin extracting materials from asteroids by the mid-2020s, according to the company’s president and CEO, Chris Lewicki.

Planetary Resources has raised tens of millions of dollars since its founding in 2012. Deep Space Industries was founded a year later, and has raised an undisclosed amount of seed money from investors including Metatron Global. Both companies have forged partnerships with Luxembourg’s government as part of that European nation’s SpaceResources.lu initiative

<|begin_of_text|>This article is about air conditioning. For similar concept in atomic physics, see Evaporative cooling (atomic physics)

An evaporative cooler (also swamp cooler, swamp box, desert cooler and wet air cooler) is a device that cools air through the evaporation of water. Evaporative cooling differs from typical air conditioning systems, which use vapor-compression or absorption refrigeration cycles. Evaporative cooling uses the fact that water will absorb a relatively large amount of heat in order to evaporate (that is, it has a large enthalpy of vaporization). The temperature of dry air can be dropped significantly through the phase transition of liquid water to water vapor (evaporation). This can cool air using much less energy than refrigeration. In extremely dry climates, evaporative cooling of air has the added benefit of conditioning the air with more moisture for the comfort of building occupants.

The cooling potential for evaporative cooling is dependent on the wet-bulb depression, the difference between dry-bulb temperature and wet-bulb temperature (see relative humidity). In arid climates, evaporative cooling can reduce energy consumption and total equipment for conditioning as an alternative to compressor-based cooling. In climates not considered arid, indirect evaporative cooling can still take advantage of the evaporative cooling process without increasing humidity. Passive evaporative cooling strategies can offer the same benefits of mechanical evaporative cooling systems without the complexity of equipment and ductwork.

An earlier form of evaporative cooling, the windcatcher, was first used in ancient Egypt and Persia thousands of years ago in the form of wind shafts on the roof. They caught the wind, passed it over subterranean water in a qanat and discharged the cooled air into the building. Modern Iranians have widely adopted powered evaporative coolers (coolere âbi).[1]

The evaporative cooler was the subject of numerous US patents in the 20th century; many of these, starting in 1906,[2] suggested or assumed the use of excelsior (wood wool) pads as the elements to bring a large volume of water in contact with moving air to allow evaporation to occur. A typical design, as shown in a 1945 patent, includes a water reservoir (usually with level controlled by a float valve), a pump to circulate water over the excelsior pads and

An increase in aridity due to global warming will disturb the balance of nutrients in the soil and reduce productivity of the world’s drylands, which support millions of people, a landmark study predicts.

The research was conducted by a global collaboration of scientists who carried out the same studies of 224 dryland sites in 16 countries on every continent except Antarctica.

In Australia, woodland sites in NSW near Mildura were studied by UNSW’s Adjunct Professor David Eldridge, of the School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences, who is a member of the international research team.

Other sites included areas of the Negev Desert in Israel, the Pampas lowlands in Argentina and the Altiplano highlands of Peru. Rainfall at the sites ranged from 100 to 800 mm per year, and all soil samples were analysed in the same laboratory in Spain.

The research shows that increasing aridity is associated with a reduction in carbon and nitrogen in the soil and an increase in phosphorus.

The results are published in the journal Nature.

“Drylands cover about 41 per cent of Earth’s land surface and support more than 38 per cent of the world’s population,” says Professor Eldridge, who also works for the NSW Office of Environment & Heritage.

“As the world’s population grows, people will increasingly rely on marginal lands – particularly drylands - for production of food, wood and biofuels. But these ecosystems will be severely affected by imbalances in the cycle of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus.”

A worldwide decrease in soil moisture ranging from 5-15 per cent has been predicted for the 2080-2099 period.

Phosphorus in rocks and sediments is released into the soil by weathering, and levels are expected to increase as soils become drier and erode more.

This increase in phosphorus will be accompanied by reductions in carbon and nitrogen, which are more dependent on biological processes such as litter decomposition, photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation. Reduced plant cover will also exacerbate this effect.

“Plants need all of these elements, in the correct amounts and at the right times, but increasing aridity will upset this balance, leading to a breakdown in essential soil processes,” says Professor Eldridge.

Despite the fact that I understood English really well even then, I did not find most of the humor funny. I really tried: I watched multiple episodes of SNL (Saturday Night Live), AFV (America’s Funnies Videos), The Tonight Show, South Park, Family Guy, and a bunch of other TV shows. Fast-forward ten years and you will find me enjoying SNL, hysterically laughing at Jim Gaffigan’s “Mr. Universe,” quoting Leno’s jokes, and watching up to 6 episodes of Family Guy back-to-back.

In other words, it took me several years of living in the US to fully grasp the humor behind what was being said. Once I became familiar with modern American culture, started following current events, and began recognizing public figures, the humor started adding up.

Generally speaking, a lot of humor is based on association, stereotyping, and cultural referencing. Therefore, in order to find the humor of a particular country or culture funny, you need to know and understand that country or culture fairly well. To help you better understand Russian humor (русский юмор), let me share some thoughts on the subject. Here is a quick Russian video to warm you up 🙂 The title is “American idea of a typical Russian morning.”

Some thing are universally amusing 🙂

Babies making funny faces, dogs chasing their tails, cats fighting their reflection in the mirror – you can expect a similar reaction to things of this nature whether you are in US or Russia.

I found a couple of jokes online that seem pretty funny in both languages:

It is the Democratic Republic of the Congo's largest source of export income. In 2009, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) had an estimated $24 trillion in untapped mineral deposits, including the world's largest reserves of coltan and significant quantities of the world's cobalt.[1][2] The United States Geological Survey estimates that the DRC has 1 million tons of lithium resources.[3]

During the Second Congo War mass-scale looting of mineral assets by all combattant forces—Congolese, Rwandan, Ugandan and foreign civilians—took place. The small artisanal mining operations the fighters were robbing sometimes shut down afterwards and larger foreign businesses reduced operations as well. Following the peace accord in 2003, the focus returned to mining. Rebel groups supplied international corporations through unregulated mining by soldiers, locals organized by military commanders and by foreign nationals. The political framework was unstable. In 2009 the DRC signed a loan contract with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for $12 billion of debt relief in 2010. The loan included trade conditions, such as liberalization of the diamond trade.[citation needed] At the end of 2012 the IMF suspended the last payments, because of a lack of transparency in the DRC's process for awarding mining contracts. The mining sector has since expanded, but commodity prices have declined and this has hampered the DRC's progress.

Much mining has been done in small artisanal mining operations, sometimes known as Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (ASM).[4] These small-scale mines are unregulated,[5] with high levels of child labor and workplace injury. They can occur within protected areas, and around endangered or threatened species. As of 2008 many ASM operations existed for minerals such as coltan.[citation needed] ASM operations employ a significant portion of the DRC's population; estimates range up to one fifth of the population, or 12.5 million people.[5] Problems stemming from artisanal mining include disruption of families, mining-related illnesses, environmental damage, child labor, prostitution and rape.[6][7]

On my hunt for Asian acids I came across this little oddity called Papa Recipe while browsing Wishtrend. The packaging looked cute and the ingredients promising, so in the cart it went.At the point it arrived I was all out of my beloved Mandelic acid cream and Johnny Clyde's skin was freaking out because of last years summer weather.This product came just in time for the rescue!Its a viscous transparent liquid that is thicker than water yet quite slippery.It smells just like most fragrance free acids do.Like chemicals and dust.It spreads easily on the skin and sinks in very fast leaving no trace at all.I have tried this both in combination with other acids and with the C20 Vitamin C serum and it plays well with all of them.I saw a reduction of PIH and an evening out of the skin tone while using this.Pores have not been reduced but I did not expect that to happen.It is gentle yet effective. It doesn’t burn on the skin unless you have an open wound.I noticed most of the improvement on Johnny Clyde's skin since he was having issues with spots when using this. For the first month of usage, his spots got reduce to about one every 3 days and his skin evened out noticeably. After he started using this in combination with the COSRX AHA BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner (hop over to see some impressive before and after photos) his skin improved again significantly. I believe that the COSRX toner actually boosted the Papa Recipe Gel while doing its own magic with the pores.Johnny Clyde's skin started looking more flawless by the day and after 3 months of usage his skin looks better than ever before. He hasn’t had a spot in weeks and his PIH are slowly disappearing. This is a wonderful yet effective AHA serum that is not just cheap but also shows great results.If you can’t find the Mandelic Acid cream by Pharmaceris this is the next best thing I have tried.To me it worked just as well as Paulas Choice AHA gel but for a fraction of the price.Definitely a must buy

But one group of wealthy families did just that in November 2013. Photographs of the participants’ dresses, decorations and drinks were widely shared on social networks at the time. Just a few kilometres away from the party, Syrian children in Yarmuk refugee camp were dying of hunger.

Several websites and news portals in Arabic reported on the fancy dress soiree, such as thawrtalsoryienalahrar, Syria-news, Aksalser, Al-marsd and All4Syria [all ar]. AlSulta AlRabeaa (the Fourth Authority) published photographs of the smiling party-goers on Facebook.

Syrian artist Jalal Altawil explained the details of the party on his Facebook page:

<|begin_of_text|>Currently, Mars has a thin atmosphere dominated by carbon dioxide, with pressures at most of the planet's surface so low that liquid water will immediately boil. But a variety of features we've discovered argue that the planet has once supported copious amounts of water, indicating that the planet's atmosphere must have differed considerably in the past. Using radar data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, scientists have now found a potential resting place for some material that was once in the Martian atmosphere: a huge deposit at the south pole that holds nearly as much CO 2 as the planet's current atmosphere.

Mars' south pole has extensive ice deposits, but most of that material is thought to be water, with only a thin coating of carbon dioxide on top. However, the MRO's radar instrument identified several reflection-free zones, where most of the radar signal went entirely through the icy material to the planet's surface itself. Based on the authors' calculations, this can't be water ice, but it does have very similar reflective properties to dry ice, or frozen carbon dioxide. The area also has features that indicate that some of the dry ice has sublimated to a gaseous form, resulting in areas where the surface has collapsed.

If the area is dry ice, then the total amount present is huge. The authors estimate the total volume of the non-reflective material at somewhere between 9,500 and 12,500 cubic kilometers. That's 30 times more than had previously been estimated to reside at the poles, and is about 80 percent of the current CO 2 content of the entire atmosphere. If all the dry ice were heated up, Mars' atmospheric pressure would nearly double.

Like the Earth, Mars undergoes orbital variations that alter the distribution of sunlight across the planet. One of these involves changes in the orientation of its axis of rotation relative to the plane of its orbit, called the obliquity. Mars undergoes more dramatic changes in obliquity than Earth and, as a result, its poles see more significant changes in sunlight at the extreme. The authors argue that this can help explain why the reflection-free zones lack any material from the planet's famous dust storms, which should reflect the radar effectively.

Mars' atmosphere needs to be above a certain density to support the particles that make up its dust storms. As the poles undergo extended cold periods, the authors suggest "the atmosphere collapses onto the polar caps." So much of the planet's dry ice winds up frozen at the poles that the atmosphere becomes even thinner than
