Last week, scientists announced findings based on data from the SPICAM spectrometer onboard ESA’s Mars Express spacecraft. The findings reported in Science by Maltagliati et al (2011), reveal that the Martian atmosphere is supersaturated with water vapor. According to the research team, the discovery provides new information which will help scientists better understand the water cycle and atmospheric history of Mars.

What processes are at work to allow large amounts of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere?

The animated sequence to the left shows the water cycle of the Martian atmosphere in action:

When the polar caps of Mars (which contain frozen Water and CO 2 ) are warmed by the Sun during spring and summer, the water sublimates and is released into the atmosphere.

Atmospheric winds transport the water vapor molecules to higher altitudes. When the water molecules combine with dust molecules, clouds are formed. If there isn’t much dust in the atmosphere, the rate of condensation is reduced, which leaves water vapor in the atmosphere, creating a supersaturated state.

Water vapor may also be transported by wind to the southern hemisphere or may be carried high in the atmosphere.In the upper atmosphere the water vapor can be affected by photodissociation in which solar radiation (white arrows) splits the water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen atoms, which then escape into space.

Scientists had generally assumed that supersaturation cannot exist in the cold Martian atmosphere, believing that any water vapor in excess of saturation instantly froze. Data from SPICAM revealed that supersaturation takes place at altitudes of up to 50 km above the surface when Mars is at its farthest point from the Sun.

Based on the SPICAM data, scientists have learned that there is more water vapor in the Martian atmosphere than previously believed. While the amount of water in Mars’ atmosphere is about 10,000 times less water vapor than that of Earth, previous models have underestimated the amount of water in the Martian atmosphere at altitudes of 20-50km, as the data suggests 10 to 100 times more water than expected at said altitudes.

“The vertical distribution of water vapour is a key factor in the study of Mars’ hydrological cycle, and the old paradigm that it is mainly controlled by saturation physics now needs to be revised,” said Luca Maltagliati, one of the authors of the paper. “Our finding has major implications for understanding the planet’s global climate and the transport of water from one hemisphere to the other.”

<|begin_of_text|>Our world is made of elements and combinations of elements called compounds. An element is a pure substance made of atoms that are all of the same type. At present, 116 elements are known, and only about 90 of these occur naturally.

Elements and the ‘Big Bang’ theory

During the formation of the universe some 14 billion years ago in the so-called ‘Big Bang’, only the lightest elements were formed – hydrogen and helium along with trace amounts of lithium and beryllium. As the cloud of cosmic dust and gases from the Big Bang cooled, stars formed, and these then grouped together to form galaxies.

The other 86 elements found in nature were created in nuclear reactions in these stars and in huge stellar explosions known as supernovae.

Elements and our Sun

For most of their lives, stars fuse elemental hydrogen into helium in their cores. Two atoms of hydrogen are combined in a series of steps to create helium-4. These reactions account for 85% of the Sun’s energy. The remaining 15% comes from reactions that produce the elements beryllium and lithium.

The energy from these nuclear reactions is emitted in various forms of radiation such as ultraviolet light, X-rays, visible light, infrared rays, microwaves and radio waves. In addition, energised particles such as neutrinos and protons are released, and it is these that make up the solar wind.

Earth is in the path of this energy stream, which warms the planet, drives weather and provides energy for life. The Earth’s atmosphere is able to screen out most of the harmful radiation, and the Earth’s magnetic field can deflect the harmful effects of the solar wind.

Dying stars

When a star’s core runs out of hydrogen, the star begins to die out. The dying star expands into a red giant, and this now begins to manufacture carbon atoms by fusing helium atoms.

More massive stars begin a further series of nuclear burning or reaction stages. The elements formed in these stages range from oxygen through to iron.

During a supernova, the star releases very large amounts of energy as well as neutrons, which allows elements heavier than iron, such as uranium and gold, to be produced. In the supernova explosion, all of these elements are expelled out into space.

Our world is literally made up of elements formed deep within the cores of stars now long dead. As Britain’s Astronomer Royal Sir Martin Rees said, “We are literally the ashes of long dead stars.” When you buy a

<|begin_of_text|>Spiders sprayed with a thin layer of graphene and carbon nanotubes have produced super-strong webs with record-beating properties.

Combining one of the strongest natural materials with one of the strongest artificial materials, researchers at the University of Trento in Italy created what they describe as "super silk".

"The protein matrix and hard tissues of insects, worms, ants and spiders naturally incorporates metals, such as zinc, manganese and copper," the study states. "This leads to mechanical hardening of teeth, jaws, mandibles, ovipositors and to an enhancement of silk toughness.

What is graphene? Graphene is a one-atom-thick material made of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice that is 200-times stronger than steel, more conductive than copper and as flexible as rubber. It has been touted as a "wonder material" by scientists for its remarkable properties and vast range of uses, which include everything from flexible smartphone screens to artificial retinas.

"Thus, the artificial incorporation of metals, or even insulating or semiconducting materials, into these protein structures could be exploited to obtain a reinforced matrix."

The silk created by the graphene-coated spiders is 3.5 times tougher than that of the giant riverine orb spider - the strongest silk known to nature.

The process that leads to the graphene and carbon nanotubes being infused in the silk is still not clear to the researchers, though the principle theory is that spiders make use of materials found within their immediate environments when spinning silk.

Nicola Pugno, the lead researcher in the study, believes that the strength of the material produced is the highest reported to date, even when compared to high performance fibres like kevlar or the current toughest knotted fibres.

The researchers hope that similar techniques in the future can be used to create a new class of bionic materials and have suggested that one potential application could be to create a giant net capable of catching falling aircraft.

"This approach could be extended to other animals and plants and could lead to a new class of bionic materials for ultimate applications," Pugno said.

"This concept could become a way to obtain materials with superior characteristics."<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>There may be enough oxygen in the waters of Jupiter's moon Europa to support millions of tons worth of fish, according to a new study. And while nobody is suggesting there might actually be fish on Europa, this finding suggests the Jovian satellite could be capable of supporting the kinds of life familiar to us here on Earth, if only in microbial form.

Europa, which is roughly the size of Earth's moon, is enveloped by a global ocean about 100 miles deep (160 km), with an icy crust that may be only a few miles thick. From what we know of Earth, where there is water, there is a chance at life, so for many years scientists have speculated that this Jovian moon could support extraterrestrials.

As we learned more about Jupiter's effect on its moons, the possibility for life on Europa grew even more likely. Studies showed the moon could have enough oxygen to support the kind of life we are most familiar with on Earth.

IN PICTURES: Jupiter

The ice on the surface, like all water, is made from hydrogen and oxygen, and the constant stream of radiation pouring in from Jupiter reacts with this ice to form free oxygen and other oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide. The reactivity of oxygen is key to generating the energy that helped multi-cellular life flourish on our planet.

Still, researchers had thought there was no effective method for delivering any of this oxygen-rich matter into Europa's ocean. Scientists had assumed the primary way for surface materials to migrate downward was from the impacts it would suffer from cosmic debris, which regularly bombards everything in our solar system. [Photos of Jupiter's moons.]

However, past calculations suggested that even after a few billion years, such "impact gardening" would never lead to an oxygenated layer more than some 33 feet (10 meters) deep into the ice shell, nowhere far enough down to reach the underlying ocean.

However, the new study suggests this oxygen-rich layer could be far thicker than before thought, potentially encompassing the entire crust. The key is looking at other ways to stir Europa's crust, explained researcher Richard Greenberg, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at Tucson.

The gravitational pull Europa experiences from Jupiter leads to tidal forces roughly 1,000 times stronger than what Earth feels from our moon, flexing and heating Europa and making it very active geologically. This could explain why its surface appears no older than 50 million years old — its surface underwent complete turnover in that time

These are the 5 days when the Moon’s orbit crosses Earth’s magnetotail, the vast region of the planet’s magnetosphere that gets swept back by solar wind. Within the magnetotail is a structure called the plasma sheet, a layer with a weaker magnetic field that’s relatively thick with ions.

“Our new finding suggests that the Earth-Moon system coevolves not only physically but also chemically.” Now results from Japan’s Selenological and Engineering Explorer (SELENE) lunar orbiter show that during this time when the Moon passes through Earth’s plasma sheet, significant amounts of terrestrial oxygen from Earth rain down onto the Moon’s surface. This has likely been going on since oxygen became abundant in Earth’s atmosphere some 3 billion years ago.

“Our new finding suggests that the Earth-Moon system coevolves not only physically but also chemically,” said Kentaro Terada, lead author on the study and planetary scientist at Osaka University in Japan. The research, published today in Nature Astronomy, hints that someday Moon dust could help scientists study Earth’s ancient atmosphere.

Solar Versus Terrestrial Oxygen

Solar wind, the collective stream of highly energetic particles that hurtle from the Sun, constantly batters Earth’s magnetosphere, shaping it into its characteristic teardrop form. Behind Earth, the magnetotail extends more than 600,000 kilometers.

While Earth gets buffeted by solar wind, some particles—including hydrogen and oxygen ions stripped of electrons—escape along Earth’s magnetic field lines into the plasma sheet. For a brief period during every lunar orbit, the Moon passes through the plasma sheet, where it’s exposed to these ionized particles of terrestrial origin.

But do these particles—in particular, oxygen ions—make it to the lunar surface, and if so, how would we know? Thus far, it’s been “an enigma,” Terada said. After all, oxygen carried on the solar wind also arrives at the Moon after it orbits out of Earth’s magnetotail.

Researchers decided to look at data from SELENE, nicknamed Kaguya, to see if they could pick up signs of terrestrial oxygen in the days when the Moon passed through Earth’s magnetotail. Data from Kayuga, which stopped collecting observations in 2010, revealed that during a few hours every month

<|begin_of_text|>Today’s post looks at an aspect of chemistry we come across every day: alloys. Alloys make up parts of buildings, transport, coins, and plenty of other objects in our daily lives. But what are the different alloys we use made up of, and why do we use them instead of elemental metals? The graphic answers the first of these questions, and in the post we’ll try and answer the second.

First, a little on what alloys are, for anyone unfamiliar with the term. Alloys are a mixture of elements, where at least one of the elements is a metal. There are over 80 metals in the periodic table of elements, and we can mix selections of these different metals in varying proportions, sometimes with non-metals too, to create alloys. Note the use of the word mixture: in the vast majority of cases, alloys are simply intermixed elements, rather than elements that are chemically bonded together.

Alloys can be simply classified in terms of their atomic arrangements. In cases where the two elements being mixed to make the alloy have similar atom sizes, atoms of the second element can simply take the place of atoms of the first element in the structure. These types of alloys are called substitution alloys. On the other hand, if the atoms of the second element are much smaller, they can slot into the gaps between atoms of the first element. These alloys are known as interstitial alloys. Alloys can be made in a number of ways, but they are primarily fashioned by mixing together the molten components.

There are a great range of alloys; the main graphic illustrates just a small selection of those that we use in a range of applications. But why use them in the first place when there are so many different metals with varying properties in the periodic table? Whilst metallic elements may have desirable properties, unfortunately they rarely have them in convenient combinations. Gold is shiny and, well, golden, but it’s also quite soft, meaning if you try and make a ring from pure gold, it’ll deform easily. Iron is present in many buildings, but on its own it too is a little on the soft side, and also has a tendency to rust when exposed to damp air.

Making alloys is essentially a way for us to ‘tweak’ the properties of a metal, to make them closer to the ideal properties we want for a particular purpose. Alloying gold with copper or silver makes it harder, whilst alloying iron with carbon and a selection of other metals accomplishes a similar effect, and also helps prevent it

Oxygen toxicity Synonyms Oxygen toxicity syndrome, oxygen intoxication, oxygen poisoning In 1942–43 the UK Government carried out extensive testing for oxygen toxicity in divers. The chamber is pressurised with air to 3.7 bar. The subject in the centre is breathing 100% oxygen from a mask. Specialty Emergency medicine

Oxygen toxicity is a condition resulting from the harmful effects of breathing molecular oxygen (O

2 ) at increased partial pressures. Severe cases can result in cell damage and death, with effects most often seen in the central nervous system, lungs, and eyes. Historically, the central nervous system condition was called the Paul Bert effect, and the pulmonary condition the Lorrain Smith effect, after the researchers who pioneered the discoveries and descriptions in the late 19th century. Oxygen toxicity is a concern for underwater divers, those on high concentrations of supplemental oxygen (particularly premature babies), and those undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

The result of breathing increased partial pressures of oxygen is hyperoxia, an excess of oxygen in body tissues. The body is affected in different ways depending on the type of exposure. Central nervous system toxicity is caused by short exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure. Pulmonary and ocular toxicity result from longer exposure to increased oxygen levels at normal pressure. Symptoms may include disorientation, breathing problems, and vision changes such as myopia. Prolonged exposure to above-normal oxygen partial pressures, or shorter exposures to very high partial pressures, can cause oxidative damage to cell membranes, collapse of the alveoli in the lungs, retinal detachment, and seizures. Oxygen toxicity is managed by reducing the exposure to increased oxygen levels. Studies show that, in the long term, a robust recovery from most types of oxygen toxicity is possible.

Protocols for avoidance of the effects of hyperoxia exist in fields where oxygen is breathed at higher-than-normal partial pressures, including underwater diving using compressed breathing gases, hyperbaric medicine, neonatal care and human spaceflight. These protocols have resulted in the increasing rarity of seizures due to oxygen toxicity, with pulmonary and ocular damage being mainly confined to the problems of managing premature infants.

In recent years, oxygen has become available for recreational use in oxygen bars. The US Food and Drug Administration has warned those suffering from problems such as heart or lung disease not to use oxygen bars. Scuba divers use breathing gases containing up to 100% oxygen, and should have specific

This so-called interstellar material was spotted by NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX), a spacecraft that is studying the edge of the solar system from its orbit about 200,000 miles (322,000 kilometers) above Earth.

"This alien interstellar material is really the stuff that stars and planets and people are made of — it's really important to be measuring it," David McComas, IBEX principal investigator and assistant vice president of the Space Science and Engineering Division at Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, said in a news briefing from NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.

An international team of scientists presented new findings from IBEX, which included the first detection of alien particles of hydrogen, oxygen and neon, in addition to the confirmation of previously detected helium. [Images from NASA's IBEX Mission]

These atoms are remnants of older stars that have ended their lives in violent explosions, called supernovas, which dispersed the elements throughout the galaxy. As interstellar wind blows these charged and neutral particles through the Milky Way, the IBEX probe is able to create a census of the elements that are present.

Heavy elements in space

According to the new study, the researchers found 74 oxygen atoms for every 20 neon atoms in the interstellar wind. For comparison, there are 111 oxygen atoms for every 20 neon atoms in our solar system, meaning there are more oxygen atoms in any part of the solar system than in nearby interstellar space, the scientists said in a statement.

"These are important elements to know quantitatively because they are the building blocks of stars, planets, people," McComas said. "We discovered this puzzle: matter outside our solar system doesn't look like material inside our solar system. It seems to be deficient in oxygen compared to neon."

The presence of less oxygen within interstellar material could indicate that the sun formed in a region with less oxygen compared to its current location, the researchers said.

Or, it could be a sign that oxygen is "locked up" in other galactic materials, such as cosmic grains of dust or ice. [Top 10 Strangest Things in Space]

An explosion last month that caused a University of Hawaii, Manoa, postdoctoral researcher to lose an arm was caused by a spark from a digital pressure gauge that was not designed for use with flammable gases, says a Honolulu Fire Department investigation report.

Thea Ekins-Coward was combining hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and oxygen gases from high-pressure cylinders into a lower pressure tank when the incident occurred. She has not given the university permission to release information about her condition, said spokesman Daniel Meisenzahl at an April 18 press conference.

The gas mixture was “food” for bacteria being used to produce biofuels and bioplastics. Ekins-Coward was working for the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute under researcher Jian Yu. A 2013 paper by Yu indicates a set-up in which gases are plumbed through a mixing device called a gas proportioner directly into the bioreactor (Int. J. Hydrogen Energy 2013, DOI: 10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.04.153). The gas gauge identified in the paper is an “intrinsically safe” model designed to prevent ignition.

But after Ekins-Coward started in the lab last fall, she purchased a 49-L steel gas tank, a different gauge not rated as intrinsically safe, a pressure-relief valve, and fittings, and she put them together, Yu and Ekins-Coward told fire department investigators, according to the report. Ekins-Coward would add the gases to the portable tank, which would then be connected to the bioreactor. She was using a mixture of 70% hydrogen, 25% oxygen, and 5% carbon dioxide for her experiments, the report says.

In the week before the incident, a similar set-up with a 3.8-L tank resulted in a “small internal explosion” when Ekins-Coward pressed the off button on the gauge, the fire department report says. She also occasionally experienced static shocks when touching the tank, which was not grounded. She reported the shocks and possibly the small explosion to Yu, who told her not to worry about it, the report says.

On the day of the incident, the 49-L tank exploded when Ekins-Coward pressed the off button on the gauge. “She did not lose consciousness or hit her head; she was aware that she lost her arm in the explosion,” the report

<|begin_of_text|>Wood gas is a syngas fuel which can be used as a fuel for furnaces, stoves and vehicles in place of gasoline, diesel or other fuels. During the production process biomass or other carbon-containing materials are gasified within the oxygen-limited environment of a wood gas generator to produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide. These gases can then be burnt as a fuel within an oxygen rich environment to produce carbon dioxide, water and heat. In some gasifiers this process is preceded by pyrolysis, where the biomass or coal is first converted to char, releasing methane and tar rich in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

History [ edit ]

A bus, powered by wood gas generated by a gassifier on a trailer, Leeds, England c.1943

The first wood gasifier was apparently built by Gustav Bischof in 1839. The first vehicle powered by wood gas was built by Thomas Hugh Parker in 1901.[1] Around 1900, many cities delivered syngas (centrally produced, typically from coal) to residences. Natural gas began to be used only in 1930.

Wood gas vehicles were used during World War II as a consequence of the rationing of fossil fuels. In Germany alone, around 500,000 "producer gas" vehicles were in use at the end of the war. Trucks, buses, tractors, motorcycles, ships and trains were equipped with a wood gasification unit. In 1942, when wood gas had not yet reached the height of its popularity, there were about 73,000 wood gas vehicles in Sweden,[2] 65,000 in France, 10,000 in Denmark, and almost 8,000 in Switzerland. In 1944, Finland had 43,000 "woodmobiles", of which 30,000 were buses and trucks, 7,000 private vehicles, 4,000 tractors and 600 boats.[3]

Wood gasifiers are still manufactured in China and Russia for automobiles and as power generators for industrial applications. Trucks retrofitted with wood gasifiers are used in North Korea[4] in rural areas, particularly on the roads of the east coast.

Many orders of magnitude smaller than household wires, nanowires can be made from a variety of semiconducting materials including germanium and silicon.

For years, the synthesis of nanowires has been somewhat mysterious, requiring scientists to experiment with reactor settings, modulating temperature and pressure, to see what would work best – a slow, arduous process of trial and error. “It’s been like cooking something in the oven without ever being able to look in until it’s done hours later,” explains Michael Filler, associate professor at Georgia Tech’s School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering.

However, a team working in the Filler Laboratory has gained unprecedented insight into the nanowire growth process through the use of real-time infrared spectroscopy. They found that surface species, specifically hydrogen atoms and methyl groups, decorate the nanowire’s surface and are essential for the stable growth of nanowires made from germanium.

According to the study’s findings, without the presence of hydrogen and methyl adsorbing (or adhering) to the nanowire sidewalls, the liquid droplet that sits atop the nanowire could slip, causing growth to cease. “These surface species, hydrogen and methyl molecules, act like a layer of Rain-X, keeping the droplet in place,” Filler explains.

“Our work shows that without these surface adsorbates, growth doesn’t happen. No one knew that before,” says Filler, whose research team published its findings in a recent issue of the Journal of the American Chemical Society. “For as long as scientists have been using this growth method – more than five decades – we didn’t know that anything was present on the wire surface.”

Now that the scientific community is aware of this key aspect of nanowire synthesis, researchers will be able to better design processes and precursors to choreograph nanowire growth, Filler says. As obstacles to the production of nanowires are overcome, they can be manufactured on a greater sale and incorporated into commercial products.

“The fundamental chemical knowledge provided in our study promises to advance the rational synthetic design of nanowire structure and function,” Filler says.

If you drink factory-made beverages, you are ingesting chemicals

(NaturalNews) Coca-Cola and Pepsico have both announced they are removing brominated vegetable oil (BVO) from their beverage products following a sustained social media campaign that protested the practice. Brominated vegetable oil is a flame retardant, and it's usually made from genetically modified corn or soy derivatives bonded with a bromine atom., just like fluoride and chlorine (they're all in the same column on the Table of Elements).

Virtual reality (VR) headsets such as the Oculus Rift will line store shelves this holiday season, and UC San Diego alumni startup Nanome, Inc. plans to capitalize on that by creating VR apps for the consumer market, the classroom, and beyond.

Nanome co-founder Steven McCloskey was part of the first graduating class of NanoEngineering at UC San Diego when he received his bachelor’s degree in 2015. Frustrated by the lack of tools available to nanoengineers for complex 3D modeling and simulation at the nanoscale, he set out to try and rectify the problem. He and colleagues built the first molecular visualization, modeling and simulation tool for today’s VR platforms called nano-one. The application allows users to build molecules with carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen atoms.

“Our goal is to provide the tools necessary to help people build new proteins and molecules and eventually also simulate their interactions,” said McCloskey. “You can see how the world works at this fundamental level, and re-make it.”

Why VR? Everything is made out of atoms—cosmetics, computer hardware, everything. Take a chair, for example. A chair can’t just look like a chair, it has to act like one. If you’re going to be manipulating things in 3D, you also need to be able to change the material properties of an object, which is dictated by structures at the nanoscale level.

McCloskey said he believes nanoscale virtual reality represents the future of engineering.

“UC San Diego is where this has to happen—we have a NanoEngineering department, VR experts, Protein Databank, interdisciplinary researchers, and we’re located in Biotech Beach,” he said.

Nano-one is now being tested in the UC San Diego Chemistry Department and in the consumer market for workflow integration, modeling precision, and optimal pattern-recognition and discovery.

As nano-one was being developed, McCloskey and his colleagues had an idea for another VR tool that would help engineers with math.

“When I was in Vector Calculus as a NanoEngineering major, I wanted better 3D graphics to go along with the instruction,” said McCloskey.

Research finds that spending time by the ocean is pretty good for your wellbeing. In fact, according to an analysis of English census data published in the journal Health Place, those who live by the coast report better physical and mental health than those who don’t.

And in a study published in the Journal of Coastal Zone Management, participants who live in homes with ocean views report feeling calmer than those without them.

So, it makes sense then that Hawaii has earned the ranking of happiest state in the U.S. by the annual Gallup poll six times since 2008, doesn’t it?

How the Beach Boosts Your Mood

When it comes to why, exactly, the beach gets you feeling all Zen, there are a few factors at play, says Richard Shuster, PsyD, clinical psychologist and host of The Daily Helping podcast.

“The color blue has been found by an overwhelming amount of people to be associated with feelings of calm and peace,” says Shuster. “Staring at the ocean actually changes our brain waves’ frequency and puts us into a mild meditative state.” A study published in the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s journal even found that blue is associated with a boost of creativity.

The smell of the ocean breeze contributes to your soothed state, which may have something to do with the negative ions in the air that you’re breathing in.

Plus, that consistent ebbing and flowing you hear as you lie on your towel under an umbrella? “It kind of de-stimulates our brains,” says Shuster. The noises — coupled with the visuals — activate your parasympathetic nervous system, which is “responsible for slowing us down and allowing us to relax and feel more engaged,” says Sally Nazari, PsyD, owner of Chrysalis Psychological Services and host of the podcast Beyond the Couch.

The smell of the ocean breeze also contributes to your soothed state, which may have something to do with the negative ions in the air that you’re breathing in. These oxygen atoms have an extra electron and occur in places like waterfalls and the ocean, says Shuster. A study published in the

Water accounts for nearly 57 percent of an adult male's body weight. Nearly 70 percent of our planet's surface is covered in water. Unimaginable numbers of water molecules travel the earth via the ebbs and flows of tides, the acceleration of eddies and whirlpools and the dynamic surges of currents and floods, torrents and tsunamis.

Some 1200 years after it disappeared beneath the surface of the Mediterranean Sea, the ancient Egyptian city of Heracleion was recently discovered by archaeologist Frank Goddo and a team from the European Institute of Underwater Archaeology.

Meanwhile, as islands in the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean start to disappear and scientists use computer modeling to imagine the impact of rising sea levels on coastal cities, a picture is still worth a thousand words.

Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy showed the devastation that can be wrought by a storm surge. This footage of the tsunami that followed the March 2011 Tohoku earthquake off the northeastern coast of Japan offers stunning visuals of the power unleashed by vast volumes of water gathering momentum.

Man has always had a love-hate relationship with salt water. While the fish it contains can provide seemingly endless amounts of nutrition -- and a sailing vessel caught in a doldrum can remain becalmed for days on end -- a tsunami like the one that struck the Indian Ocean in 2004 can kill nearly a quarter of a million people.

How curious then, that San Francisco's recent DocFest should feature three documentaries (each with a different length and theme) which investigate man's relationship with the salt water in his life.

Isn't ice WONDERful? On a hot day, nothing goes down quite as well as lemonade poured over a glass full of ice cubes. In fact, ice makes so many things better. For example, we love to use ice to make homemade ice cream!

When Old Man Winter comes calling, falling temperatures can turn creeks, lakes, ponds, and even rivers into frozen rinks you can skate on. But what about the ocean? If you've ever been to the ocean in the winter, you've probably noticed that it doesn't freeze like a small pond might.

So does the ocean ever freeze? If you've seen pictures of the North Pole or the South Pole, you know that there are polar ice caps in those places. If the ocean freezes in those areas, why doesn't the rest of the ocean freeze during the winter?

The freezing point of freshwater is 0° Celsius or 32° Fahrenheit. The presence of salt in water, though, reduces the freezing point of water. The more salt in the water, the lower the freezing point will be.

When freshwater freezes, water molecules of hydrogen and oxygen have bonded together into a crystalline structure of ice. The presence of salt makes it harder for water molecules to bond to the ice structure, because ice naturally repels salt molecules. So in a sense, the salt gets in the way of water molecules, blocking them from joining the ice. The salt also bumps into the ice, knocking water molecules off of the structure -- and that's how salt melts ice.

When salt molecules displace water molecules, the freezing rate slows down. This is why salt is often used on icy roads to slow down freezing and make them safer to travel upon.

Although the saltiness of ocean water varies, often ocean water has about 35 grams of salt for every 1,000 units of water. This lowers the freezing point of ocean water to about -1.8° C or 28.8° F. So ocean water will freeze. It just needs to reach a lower temperature.

Another factor that affects the freezing of ocean water is its movement. Unlike ponds, ocean waves move around constantly. This helps ocean water retain heat. As a result, only really cold areas, such as the North Pole or South Pole, usually get cold enough for ocean water to freeze.

The western 'head' region consists mostly of heavily cratered 'alpine' terrain. The middle part of Cthulhu Macula is meanwhile a smooth plain, probably formed through large cryovolcanic eruptions, like Vulcan Planum on Charon. This part appears to be younger than the alpine terrain to the east, but there are nevertheless several large craters located in this region. The western 'tail' region of Cthulhu Macula was imaged in much lower resolution than the eastern part, but it can be inferred that this is a hilly landscape bordered by mountains to the west.[9][10][11] Higher-resolution images of the border between the two regions indicate that lighter material from Sputnik Planitia, composed of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane ices, may be invading and overlaying the easternmost part of the dark Cthulhu Macula.[12] As of 30 July 2015, the eastern "head" region had been imaged in much higher resolution than the western "tail" region.[13]

The answer is the atomic clock, which Swiss scientists are developing at CSEM (Centre Suisse d’électronique et microtechnique) in the Swiss city of Neuchatel.

The atomic clock measures time accurately, because it relies on the radiation emitted by atoms. It means that the frequency emitted by atoms of hydrogen are measured, and that gives the reference for the time. The original version of the atomic clock, built in the 90s, was the size of a household washing machine.

But CSEM scientists working in Neuchatel’s old astronomical observatory are moving steadily towards the progressive miniaturisation of the atomic clock. Their goal is to reduce it to the size of a sugar cube.

Miniaturisation will greatly reduce manufacturing costs and power consumption allowing this technology to be used more widely, possibly it could even enter the consumer market in battery-operated devices, like GPS or smart phones.

According to physicist Steve Lecomte, what is known as the heart of the clock is key. It has to be reduced in size to nearly a millimetre: “Minitiarisation is useful in order to put atomic clocks in more instruments and mobile devices. Our ultimate goal here at CSEM is work towards having an atomic timepiece in a wrist-watch.”

Scientists not only hope to install atomic clocks in consumer electronic devices, but they want to use them for scientific purposes, such as verifying Einstein’s theory of relativity.

“If we were to put an atomic clock in a smartphone with a GPS for example, then we’d have a frequency base in the GPS which would allow a faster sychronisation with geo-positioning satellites and therefore a more efficient device,” explained CSEM physicist Jacques Haesler.

“Right now, if you have in a wrist-watch, you have to wind it up from time to time. Maybe every day or every few weeks. With an atomic clock inside, in theory you’ll only need to set it once every 3,000 years, providing of course your battery lasts that long,” he added.

Today the best atomic clocks are able to keep time to the point where they will gain or lose a second, every one billion years, and they are powered by an extremely tiny engine. This miniscule part, only a millimetre across, holds the key to a future in which

LAKE WALES, Fla. -- Researchers at the Department of Energy's (DoE's) Brookhaven National Laboratory have claimed a world record, saying they have patterned devices with feature sizes as small as 1nm. The research team hopes to use the same technique to create and impart to silicon new properties never before observed.

So far, the Brookhaven researchers have only proven the concept with poly-methyl methacrylate or PMMA -- a polymer commonly used as a coating in lithography as an alternative to glass (under the Plexiglas trade name) and a resist called hydrogen silsesquioxane. A schematic showing a focused electron beam (green) shining through a polymeric film (grey: carbon atoms; red: oxygen atoms; white: hydrogen atoms) with yellow indicating scope of electron beam.

Brookhaven scientists made clever use of an electron microscope to pattern the material at even smaller sizes than is normally possible with electron-beam lithography (EBL). The electron-sensitive materials were exposed to a focused beam of electrons, as usual, but with its features reduced to a size capable of manipulating individual atoms. The result is a new tool capable of dramatically altering a material's properties, from electrical conductivity to light transmission and interactions between the two.

The feat was accomplished by the Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN), a DoE Office of Science User Facility at Brookhaven (Long Island, N.Y.). The 1nm features patterned using the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) were spaced 11 nanometers apart, which could allow nearly one trillion features to be patterned within a single square centimeter. They also achieved 2nm resolution with the aberration-corrected STEM with a 5nm half-pitch in hydrogen silsesquioxane resist.

The resolution limits of aberration-corrected electron-beam lithography -- usually 10 nanometers at best -- were improved by installing a slow-moving pattern generator that followed the instructions from a specialized computer program.

<|begin_of_text|>Nobody wants a laptop computer that stops working when a cloud passes by. Storing sunlight as fuel that can be later used to drive fuel cells requires new materials. Scientists demonstrated such a material. They combined two oxides on the atomic scale. The interface between the oxide materials, one containing strontium and titanium and one containing lanthanum and chromium, absorbs visible light, producing electrons and holes that might be useful for catalyzing reactions, such as producing hydrogen fuel. However, if there is nothing to pull those electrons and holes apart, they will quickly annihilate one another without doing anything useful. By carefully synthesizing this material as a series of alternating layers, the international team created a built-in electric field that could help separate the excited electrons and holes and improve the material's performance as a catalyst.

This material opens up new scientific frontiers to solve a persistent energy challenge: storing solar energy for later use. Fuel cells capable of running on hydrogen fuel created by solar energy could allow people to heat their homes and run their computers on solar energy even in the dark of night.

By depositing thin layers of SrTiO 3 and LaCrO 3 on a crystalline substrate, the investigators at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, SuperSTEM, and the University of Oxford controlled how the ions at the interfaces bond to each other. This allowed them to engineer an electric field in the material that can be used to separate electrons and holes. Using X-ray spectroscopy techniques, they confirmed that the electric field was present and that the ions in the material shift positions as a result. Ultra-high resolution measurements using an electron microscope helped confirm this ionic shift.

All of these experimental results were backed up by computational modeling of the materials, which predicted behavior in excellent agreement with what was observed.

The electric field in these materials is present because the researchers were able to precisely control the growth process so that each interface has either a positive or negative charge. Alternating positively and negatively charged interfaces in the material produce nanoscale electric fields that can interact with the electrons and holes that are excited by solar energy. Electrons may then be driven to the surface, where they could interact with water molecules to break their bonds and produce hydrogen fuel.

Researchers are continuing to explore the properties of these superlattices using cutting-edge X-ray measurements at synchrotrons around the world and using other advanced microscopy techniques to look at the chemical makeup of the interfaces.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Add another item to the list of things one can accomplish using graphene, the wonder material of the future: Clean drinking water. Graphene could cheaply and easily remove salt from seawater, potentially turning the oceans into a vast drinking supply for thirsty populations. With properly sized holes, graphene sheets may be able to serve as all-purpose filters.

For desalination, the key is in properly-sized graphene pores that can allow water molecules to pass through but not salt. The ideal size is about one nanometer — even a smidge tinier, three-quarters of a nanometer, is too small for water itself to pass through. The pores are not blocking thick salt crystals, necessarily — they're blocking the atoms that make up salt.

Graphene is special in lots of ways; one-atom-thick sheets of bonded carbon atoms, it's the strongest material known, and it has important electronic properties. Its smallest possible bond is about 0.14 nanometers, so it can be hooked together in very tiny configurations, although this is difficult to do. At MIT, materials scientist Jeffrey Grossman and graduate students have been running computer models to determine the right pore size. They may need to bombard graphene sheets with helium ions to make properly-sized pores, or perhaps some nanostructuring techniques to grow the right size sheets. The pores may also need to be treated with other chemicals to make them interact with water molecules.

Once it's constructed, a graphene water purification system would be fairly simple, at least energy-wise. Modern desalination techniques require vast amounts of energy to force water through porous membranes at very high pressures. But a graphene sheet could filter it passively, interacting with ions in the saltwater. With the same water pressure as regular desalination plants, the graphene system would be hundreds of times faster, according to Grossman — or it could work at much lower pressure, and therefore lower cost.

New York’s streetlights currently produce a baleful orange glow by electrocuting vaporized sodium atoms. Sodium bulbs have been around since the 1930s and are commonly used in cities. But LEDs last longer (20 years) than sodium bulbs (6 years), tend to be more efficient, and give off cleaner, more illuminating light.

New York has already gone to LEDs on select streets in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and in Central Park. The $76.5 million project will replace streetlights in waves of 80,000 and, and if projections bear out, save $14 million in maintenance and energy annually.

New York’s transportation commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan, said in a press conference, “These 250,000 new lights will redefine our roadways and neighborhoods, bringing in clearer, whiter and more attractive lights to our 6,000 miles of streets and 12,000 miles of sidewalks.”

Bloomberg and company say New York City’s LED project is the world’s biggest—but it’s hardly the first.

Los Angeles, for example, recently finished replacing just over 141,000 streetlights with LEDs. The city says savings have so far outstripped projections (63% cost reduction compared to the forecast 40%), and light pollution is much reduced because LEDs can be better directed, preventing unintended light leakage.

Other US cities upgrading to LED streetlights include Seattle, Las Vegas, Austin, and San Antonio, among others. Buenos Aires will soon install some 100,000 LED streetlights. More may follow. According to Navigant Research, shipments of LED streetlights are set to rise from 3 million in 2012 to 17 million in 2020.

Beyond energy and maintenance savings, LEDs can also make city lighting smarter. Senior Navigant research analyst, Eric Woods, said, “LED lamps allow for better dimming control than standard street lights, and their electronics allow for easy integration of control nodes.”

Woods thinks finance may be the biggest hindrance to wider adoption. Upfront costs of projects can stymy cash-strapped municipalities.

Accelerating adoption of LED lighting in cities is mirrored at home. Though LEDs currently make up less than 10% of the residential market, they

What's in a name? For the Greek god of the sun, Helios.

Say what? Helium is pronounced as HEE-lee-em.

History and Uses:

Helium, the second most abundant element in the universe, was discovered on the sun before it was found on the earth. Pierre-Jules-César Janssen, a French astronomer, noticed a yellow line in the sun's spectrum while studying a total solar eclipse in 1868. Sir Norman Lockyer, an English astronomer, realized that this line, with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometers, could not be produced by any element known at the time. It was hypothesized that a new element on the sun was responsible for this mysterious yellow emission. This unknown element was named helium by Lockyer.

The hunt to find helium on earth ended in 1895. Sir William Ramsay, a Scottish chemist, conducted an experiment with a mineral containing uranium called clevite. He exposed the clevite to mineral acids and collected the gases that were produced. He then sent a sample of these gases to two scientists, Lockyer and Sir William Crookes, who were able to identify the helium within it. Two Swedish chemists, Nils Langlet and Per Theodor Cleve, independently found helium in clevite at about the same time as Ramsay.

Helium makes up about 0.0005% of the earth's atmosphere. This trace amount of helium is not gravitationally bound to the earth and is constantly lost to space. The earth's atmospheric helium is replaced by the decay of radioactive elements in the earth's crust. Alpha decay, one type of radioactive decay, produces particles called alpha particles. An alpha particle can become a helium atom once it captures two electrons from its surroundings. This newly formed helium can eventually work its way to the atmosphere through cracks in the crust.

Refrigerators in our kitchens cool food by powering pumps that compress gases like Freon. Some scientists and engineers would like to scrap those energy inefficient compressors and chill refrigerators using low energy magnets. These researchers are on the hunt for practical materials that exhibit the magnetocaloric effect—the ability of a substance to heat and cool under the influence of a magnetic field. Now a team at Florida State University has shown that inexpensive transition-metal borides exhibit the magnetocaloric effect at low magnetic fields (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013, DOI: 10.1021/ja404107p).

A material that exhibits a magnetocaloric effect will heat up in an applied magnetic field and then cool when the field is removed. Basically, the material releases energy when a magnetic field forces its magnetic poles to align and then absorbs energy when the field is gone and the poles randomize.

In 1997, Karl A. Gschneidner Jr. and colleagues at the Ames National Laboratory demonstrated the first material with a strong magnetocaloric effect at near room temperature. Unfortunately, this alloy of gadolinium, silicon, and germanium (Gd 5 Si 2 Ge 2 ) requires strong magnetic fields applied by an electromagnet to cool down significantly. It also contains expensive rare-earth elements.

Since that discovery, materials scientists have been hunting for magnetocaloric materials that work under the relatively weak magnetic fields produced by strong permanent magnets. Without the need to power an electromagnet, a magnetic refrigerator would require little energy to operate.

During that hunt for new materials, no one had looked at borides, says Michael Shatruk, a chemist at Florida State University. Shatruk notes that the strongest permanent magnets are made from neodymium iron boron. He thought that taking out the neodymium might give the material magnetocaloric properties. Indeed, he and his colleagues found that iron boron and manganese boron exhibit the magnetocaloric effect—but at about 300 °C. Computer modeling suggested that adding aluminum ions would bring down the temperature to more practical levels.

To test their prediction, Shatruk’s group synthesized the aluminum iron bor

I thought it would be a few years before we saw hydrogen fuel cells used in camping… but here they are…

One of the award winners at this year’s Outdoor Trade Show was the Hydrogen Fuel Cell USB charger from Brunton.

This phone charger takes lightweight hydrogen fuel cells that releases hydrogen into a reactor to generate power, and only releases water vapour, not fumes.

They estimate that a single hydrogen fuel cell, which just looks like a metal cylinder, is equivalent to 15AA batteries and should be enough for 6 mobile phone charges.

The reactor comes with two hydrogen fuel cells, and more can be purchased (believed to be around £4 each).

Now for most of us family campers, we usually camp with our car, and so a 12V adaptor that fits in the car usually does the trick. Solar powered chargers have also improved recently, and the Coleman CPX Lanterns also come with a USB charging solution. However, the use of hydrogen fuel cells and their promise of ‘clean’ energy has really been only in university research departments. Until now.

We had a play with the Brunton hydrogen reactor at the show. It’s really lightweight and small – ideal to fit in a back pack.

I know they told me not to go straight there, but I didn't feel like having to navigate this dump when it started getting really hot. I couldn't really bolt without shaking the toaster on my arm loose anyway, so the reasons to beeline outweighed those not to.

The walk gave me some time to think. My mind immediately turned to shower thoughts about the area. How many ponies were living in the San Cimarron area? Surely a desert settlement would have serious challenges with water, particularly considering that in a post-balefire landscape, there wouldn't be many living cacti. The Rangers probably had stuff like condensers and the tools for drilling down to the water table, the Enclave could have clouds shipped in or something, and Los Arabos had the ability to strip hydrogen and oxygen straight from rocks or something for all I knew. But the local settlements would have some real problems.

After a half-built housing project, the shell of a community college, another U-235, and an ostentatious glass-roofed shopping mall that looked like it was in decline even before the world ended, my thoughts had ended up on, like, how pretty much any music you can think of can be improved by the addition of a brass section.

<|begin_of_text|>A low-cost, high-speed method for printing graphene inks using a conventional roll-to-roll printing process, like that used to print newspapers and crisp packets, could open up a wide range of practical applications, including inexpensive printed electronics, intelligent packaging and disposable sensors.

Developed by researchers at the University of Cambridge in collaboration with Cambridge-based technology company Novalia, the method allows graphene and other electrically conducting materials to be added to conventional water-based inks and printed using typical commercial equipment, the first time that graphene has been used for printing on a large-scale commercial printing press at high speed.

Graphene is a two-dimensional sheet of carbon atoms, just one atom thick. Its flexibility, optical transparency and electrical conductivity make it suitable for a wide range of applications, including printed electronics. Although numerous laboratory prototypes have been demonstrated around the world, widespread commercial use of graphene is yet to be realised.

“We are pleased to be the first to bring graphene inks close to real-world manufacturing. There are lots of companies that have produced graphene inks, but none of them has done it on a scale close to this,” said Dr Tawfique Hasan of the Cambridge Graphene Centre (CGC), who developed the method. “Being able to produce conductive inks that could effortlessly be used for printing at a commercial scale at a very high speed will open up all kinds of different applications for graphene and other similar materials.”

“This method will allow us to put electronic systems into entirely unexpected shapes,” said Chris Jones of Novalia. “It’s an incredibly flexible enabling technology.”

Hasan’s method, developed at the University’s Nanoscience Centre, works by suspending tiny particles of graphene in a ‘carrier’ solvent mixture, which is added to conductive water-based ink formulations. The ratio of the ingredients can be adjusted to control the liquid’s properties, allowing the carrier solvent to be easily mixed into a conventional conductive water-based ink to significantly reduce the resistance. The same method works for materials other than graphene, including metallic, semiconducting and insulating nanoparticles.

Currently, printed conductive patterns use a combination of poorly conducting carbon with other materials, most commonly silver, which is expensive. Silver-based inks cost £1000 or more per kilogram, whereas this new graphene ink formulation would be 25 times cheaper. Additionally, silver is not recyclable, while graphene and other carbon materials can easily be recycled. The new method uses cheap, non-toxic and environmentally friendly solvents that can be dried quickly at room temperature,

<|begin_of_text|>COLUMBUS, Ohio—Researchers at The Ohio State University have discovered how to control heat with a magnetic field.

In the March 23 issue of the journal Nature Materials, they describe how a magnetic field roughly the size of a medical MRI reduced the amount of heat flowing through a semiconductor by 12 percent.

The study is the first ever to prove that acoustic phonons—the elemental particles that transmit both heat and sound—have magnetic properties.

“This adds a new dimension to our understanding of acoustic waves,” said Joseph Heremans, Ohio Eminent Scholar in Nanotechnology and professor of mechanical engineering at Ohio State. “We’ve shown that we can steer heat magnetically. With a strong enough magnetic field, we should be able to steer sound waves, too.”

Joseph Heremans

People might be surprised enough to learn that heat and sound have anything to do with each other, much less that either can be controlled by magnets, Heremans acknowledged. But both are expressions of the same form of energy, quantum mechanically speaking. So any force that controls one should control the other.

“Essentially, heat is the vibration of atoms,” he explained. “Heat is conducted through materials by vibrations. The hotter a material is, the faster the atoms vibrate.

“Sound is the vibration of atoms, too,” he continued. “It’s through vibrations that I talk to you, because my vocal chords compress the air and create vibrations that travel to you, and you pick them up in your ears as sound.”

The name “phonon” sounds a lot like “photon.” That’s because researchers consider them to be cousins: Photons are particles of light, and phonons are particles of heat and sound. But researchers have studied photons intensely for a hundred years—ever since Einstein discovered the photoelectric effect. Phonons haven’t received as much attention, and so not as much is known about them beyond their properties of heat and sound.

Hyungyu Jin

This study shows that phonons have magnetic properties, too.

“We believe that these general properties are present in any solid,” said Hyungyu Jin, Ohio State postdoctoral researcher and lead author of the study.

The implication: In materials such as glass, stone, plastic—materials that are not conventionally magnetic—heat can be controlled magnetically, if you have a powerful enough magnet. The effect would go unnoticed in metals, which transmit so much heat via electrons that any heat carried by phonons is negligible by comparison.

There won’t be any practical applications of this discovery

<|begin_of_text|>Dubai's Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) said it has launched the trial run of the first electric hydrogen fuel-cell electric vehicle, Toyota Mirai, in collaboration with Al Futtaim Motors.

Being inducted into the Dubai Taxi fleet, the new hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle has only water emissions. It is noiseless and can travel 500 km on a full tank, and refilling it takes not more than five minutes.

The emission-free Toyota Mirai is powered by hydrogen, which generates electricity inside the engine after being mixed with oxygen supplied through the grill intake at the front of the vehicle.

The vehicle is characterised by high-level driving convenience and uses Toyota Fuel Cell System (TFCS), that combines the fuel-cell technology and the hybrid technology. It contains a fuel-cell stack and a high-pressure hydrogen tank.

"RTA attaches paramount importance to protecting the environment and saving power consumption, and safety and environmental sustainability is its strategic goal," remarked Mattar Al Tayer, the director-general and chairman of the board of executive directors.

"We have announced a plan to convert 50 per cent of Dubai Taxicabs into hybrid vehicles by 2021," he noted.

"The plan involves raising the number of hybrid taxis in Dubai from 791 in 2016 to 4,750 in 2021. The Dubai Taxi Corporation accounts for the largest share of hybrid vehicles (2,280 vehicles), and the number of hybrid vehicles currently accounts for 20 per cent of the fleet," he added.

Expressing his delight at the DTC becoming the first taxi operator in the Middle East to deploy a hydrogen fuel-cell electric vehicle (Mirai) in its fleet, Al Tayer said: "RTA will start a trial run of the vehicle as part of its limousine service in the Dubai International Airport to assess the economic feasibility and environmental benefits of its operation besides verifying the efficiency of the engine, maintenance cost and other parameters."

According to him, RTA was the first entity in the region to start the trial run of hybrid (fuel and electricity) vehicles as part of its taxi fleet from 2008 to 2011.

"Results have proved the economic and environmental feasibility of the experiment by saving fuel consumption by 30 per cent and reducing carbon emission by 30 per cent as well," he added.-TradeArabia News Service<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Researchers in Japan have found a way to make the 'wonder material' graphene superconductive - which means electricity can flow through it with zero resistance. The new property adds to graphene's already impressive list of attributes, like the fact that it's stronger than steel, harder than diamond, and incredibly flexible.

But superconductivity is a big deal, even for graphene, because when electricity can flow without resistance, it can lead to significantly more efficient electronic devices, not to mention power lines. Right now, energy companies are losing about 7 percent of their energy as heat as a result of resistance in the grid.

Before you get too excited, this demonstration of superconductivity in graphene occurred at a super cold -269 degrees Celsius, so we're not going to be making power lines out of graphene any time soon.

But what is exciting, is that this research suggests that graphene could be used to build nano-sized, high-speed electronic devices. Just imagine all the electricity we could save with computers that rely on tiny graphene circuity, capable of zooming electrons around without wasting energy as heat.

For those who aren't already familiar with graphene, the material is a one-atom-thick layer of graphite (the stuff that makes up your pencils), which is made up of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal honeycomb patterns.

The electrons inside graphene are already pretty special, because they're able to take on a special state called Dirac-cone, where they behave as if they have no mass. That makes them very speedy, but even though graphene is a very efficient conductor, it's not a superconductor, which is a state that requires zero resistance.

Now a team from Tohoku University and the University of Tokyo have managed to achieve superconductivity by creating two graphene sheets and inserting calcium atoms between them - sort of like a calcium sandwich, with graphene acting as the bread.

Takashi Takahashi

These graphene sheets were grown on a silicon carbide crystal (the SiC substrate in the image above), and the team was able to show that when the temperature gets to around 4 Kelvin, or -269 degrees Celsius, the electrical conductivity of the material rapidly drops - a clear indication of superconductivity.

Superconductivity generally relies on electrons not repelling each other, as they usually do, and pairing up instead, so they can flow through materials effortlessly. As you can imagine, when that happens in a material with electrons that are already acting like they have no mass, scientists get pretty excited.

AC power plugs and sockets allow electric equipment to be connected to the alternating current (AC) power supply in buildings and at other sites. Electrical plugs and sockets differ from one another in voltage and current rating, shape, size, and connector type. Different standard systems of plugs and sockets are used around the world.

Plugs and sockets for portable appliances became available in the 1880s, to replace connections to light sockets with wall-mounted outlets. A proliferation of types developed for both convenience and protection from electrical injury. Today there are about 20 types in common use around the world, and many obsolete socket types are found in older buildings. Coordination of technical standards has allowed some types of plug to be used across large regions to facilitate trade in electrical appliances, and for the convenience of travellers and consumers of imported electrical goods.

Some multi-standard sockets allow use of several types of plug; improvised or unapproved adaptors between incompatible sockets and plugs may not provide the full safety and performance of an approved socket–plug combination.

Concepts and terminology [ edit ]

Plugs and sockets may sometimes combine male and female contacts. Clockwise from top left: CEE 7/4 (German) plug; a matching CEE 7/3 socket with exposed earth (ground) projections on circumference of socket; CEE 7/5 (French) socket with projecting earth pin. Typically no energy is supplied to any exposed pins or terminals on the socket, for safety.

A plug is the movable connector attached to an electrically operated device, and the socket is fixed on equipment or a building structure and connected to an energised electrical circuit. The plug is a male connector with protruding pins that match the openings and female contacts in a socket. Some plugs have female contacts that are used only for an earth ground connection. Some plugs have built-in fuses for safety.

To reduce the risk of electric shock, plug and socket systems have safety features in addition to the recessed contacts of the energised socket. These may include plugs with insulated sleeves, recessed sockets, or automatic shutters to block socket apertures when a plug is removed.

A socket may be surrounded by a decorative or protective cover [1] which may be integral with the socket.

Single-phase sockets have two current-carrying connections to the power supply circuit, and may also have a third pin for a safety connection to

At step 1, from the collochemistry, the metal oxide such as Fe 2 O 3, TiO 2 and SnO 2 colloid was positively charged; the GO was negatively charged because GO has many oxygen containing functional groups on the surface35. The GO and SnO 2 nanoparticles were attracted by the electrostatic force so that the SnO 2 nanoparticles can distribute on the surface of GO and not departure by the ultrasonication and stir. At step 2, L-ascorbyl acid was used to reduce oxygen containing functional groups (e.g. carboxyl) on the surface GO, producing in situ reduced GO (rGO). rGO has smaller solubility in water than GO because the reduction of polar oxygen containing functional groups makes GO less hydrophilic. So, as GO sheet began to turn into the rGO, the delocalized π-bond’s conjugative effect would be increased and enlarged. The freshly formed rGO sheets would stack on other rGO sheets as a result of the π–π stacking interactions and self-assembled into a 3D structure. After the chemical reaction and at step 3, there are still many oxygen containing functional groups left on rGO sheets, thus, the SnO 2 nanoparticles with polar surfaces would interact with those functional groups via hydrogen bonding. By annealing at 550 °C, the hydrogen bonds may turn into oxygen bridges between SnO 2 and rGO, forming Sn-O-C bonds. Therefore, the SnO 2 nanoparticles are anchored strongly on the graphene surface through a C-O-Sn bridge, which facilitates the electron transfer and improve the electrode stability. Finally, we obtain a porous ASGF with relative density of ~19 mg cm−3.

But an experiment by Teng Li and Liangbing Hu of the University of Maryland may soon put it there. For Dr Li and Dr Hu, writing in Nano Letters, have just described how wood might be used to make one class of batteries cheaper by permitting the lithium now employed in them to be replaced with sodium.

As any high-school chemist knows, lithium and sodium are chemically similar. Sodium ions (sodium atoms with an electron missing, which makes them positively charged) are, however, five times the size of lithium ions. That matters because a battery works by shuttling ions between its anode and its cathode. The bigger the ion, the more damage this shuttling causes—and the shorter, in consequence, is the battery’s life. Hitherto, that has ruled sodium out as a plausible ingredient of batteries. But engineers would still like to devise a commercially viable sodium battery, because sodium is much more abundant than lithium.

Dr Li and Dr Hu wondered if the problem of electrode damage might be ameliorated by using a more pliant material for the frames on which the electrodes are suspended. These frames, which also transmit current to and from the electrodes, are normally made of metal, and are therefore rigid. But the two researchers reckoned that suitably treated wood could do the job of conduction equally well while providing more yielding support for an electrode that was continually expanding and contracting as ions moved in and out of it.

To test this idea, they used slivers of wood from yellow pines. First, they coated these with carbon nanotubes, to improve their conductivity. Then they applied a film of tin to each sliver. (Tin is the preferred material for the anode in a lithium or sodium battery.) This done, they immersed the slivers in an electrolyte containing sodium ions and put the resulting battery through 400 cycles of discharging and recharging. As a control, they built similar batteries using slivers of copper.

The wooden battery was not perfect. Its initial capacity was 339 milliamp hours per gram (mAH/g), but that fell to 145 mAH/g over the course of the 400 cycles. This, however, was not bad for a prototype, and far better than the copper-framed batteries managed. They had an initial capacity of

<|begin_of_text|>Cryptography’s most familiar application is perhaps the sending of coded messages: Alice wants to communicate some information to her distant confidante Bob. She worries that her message might be intercepted by an eavesdropper, so she encrypts it in a way that only Bob can decipher. But there exists a whole range of complementary cryptographic tasks—such as online auctions and secure voting—in which Alice and Bob want to guard against attacks not from eavesdroppers but from each other.

To develop algorithms to perform those other tasks, cryptographers use a building block called bit commitment: Alice chooses a bit (a 1 or 0) to be revealed later; Bob wants to ensure that Alice can’t change her mind in the meantime, while Alice wants to ensure that Bob has no way to learn which bit she chose until the appointed time.

Although quantum theory is the basis for perfectly secure encryption, it offers no path to secure bit commitment. But a different law of physics, the impossibility of faster-than-light signaling, has now come to the rescue, and Anthony Martin, Hugo Zbinden, and their colleagues at the University of Geneva have implemented a protocol for achieving bit commitment for a full 24 hours.

For the protocol to work, Alice and Bob work with trusted partners Amy and Brian, respectively. Bob and Brian take turns exchanging data with Alice and Amy, in such a way that each exchange falls outside the forward light cone of the previous one. Each of Alice’s and Amy’s answers depends on both the data they receive from Bob or Brian and on information Alice and Amy agree on in advance, including the bit they want to commit. For Alice to cheat and change the bit at any time in the middle of the protocol, she’d need to know what happened in Amy’s most recent exchange with Brian; relativity prevents her from having that information.

In their 24-hour implementation, Martin and colleagues repeated the exchanges for 5 billion rounds, one every 17 µs, with a total of 162 GB of data. According to two theory papers from the past year, the probability that the protocol is vulnerable to cheating is less than one in a billion. (E. Verbanis et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 140506, 2016.)<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>One of the greatest questions of our time is whether we are alone in the universe. And if there is some sort of extraterrestrial life out there, what are those aliens like?

Neil deGrasse Tyson thinks we may have at least a glimpse within the coming decades, because we are likely to find out whether life has ever existed anywhere else in our solar system.

Read: Here’s How Black Holes and Supernovas Kill You In Space

In a recent “ask me anything” post on Reddit, the astrophysicist answered questions about aliens in our galactic neighborhood as well as in outer space in general. He said it’s entirely possible we will know “in the next couple of decades” whether Mars ever hosted life, and within the next century for the rest of the solar system as a whole, which includes moons in the outer reaches like Europa, Titan and Enceladus.

But he has bad news for the people alive today who hope to have intelligent conversations with alien life forms that are more complex than a microorganism: Earth is probably not close enough to where those extraterrestrials live.

“It’s all about our capacity to travel interstellar distances,” Tyson wrote. “And that’s surely not happening in the next 50 years. Not the rate things are going today.”

Until technology advances, scientists are looking for life on other planets in the ways they know how. That includes searching for the things that sustain us on Earth, like water, oxygen and a temperature that is not too hot and not too cold. Although that seems like a biased approach, since other life forms could live under entirely different conditions, Tyson pointed out that the most crucial elements that sustain life on our planet — which include carbon, oxygen and hydrogen — are also among the most common elements in the universe. So maybe we are onto something after all.

And if the idea of the universe’s vastness and all the potential aliens it holds makes you feel small, Tyson has a remedy for that.

“Why not instead think of how awesome it is that our [3-pound] human brain matter actually figured all this out,” he said. “Why not look up to the clear night sky, and reflect on the fact that we don’t simply live in this universe, but the universe lives within us — through the atoms and molecules of our bodies, forged in the hearts of stars that long-ago gave their lives to the galaxy... and to us.”

<|begin_of_text|>The normally quiet neighborhood around the massive black hole at the center of our Milky Way Galaxy is being invaded by a gas cloud that is destined in just a few years to be ripped, shredded and largely eaten.

Many, if not all, galaxies have massive black holes at their centers. But this supermassive black hole is the only one close enough for astronomers to study in detail, so the violent encounter is a unique chance to observe what until now has only been theorized: how a black hole gulps gas, dust and stars as it grows ever bigger.

"When we look at the black holes in the centers of other galaxies, we see them get bright and then fade, but we never know what is actually happening," said Eliot Quataert, a theoretical astrophysicist and University of California, Berkeley professor of astronomy. "This is an unprecedented opportunity to obtain unique observations and insight into the processes that go on as gas falls into a black hole, heats up and emits light. It's a neat window onto a black hole that's actually capturing gas as it spirals in."

"The next two years will be very interesting and should provide us with extremely valuable information on the behavior of matter around such massive objects, and its ultimate fate," said Reinhard Genzel, professor of physics at both UC Berkeley and the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) in Garching, Germany.

The discovery by Genzel; Stefan Gillessen of the MPE; Quataert and colleagues from Germany, Chile and Illinois will be reported online on Dec. 14, in advance of the Jan. 5 publication of the news in the British journal Nature.

Since 2008. Genzel, Gillessen, Quataert and their team have seen the gas cloud about three times the mass of Earth speeding up as it has fallen deeper into the gravitational whirlpool of the black hole. Its edges are already beginning to fray.

"It is not going to survive the experience," said first author Gillessen. He built the infrared detector on the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile used to observe the movement of stars and gas in the center of the Milky Way, 27,000 light years from Earth.

By 2013, scientists should see outbursts of X-rays and radio waves as the cloud -- composed mostly hydrogen and helium gas gets hotter and is torn asunder. The light emitted around the black hole could increase by a hundredfold to a thousandfold, Quataert calculated.

This month, at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, physicists and engineers built tracks inside one of its fusion reactors and ran a toy train on them for three days.

It was not an exercise in silliness, but in calibration.

The modified model of a diesel train engine was carrying a small chunk of californium-252, a radioactive element that spews neutrons as it falls apart.

“We needed to refine the calibration technique to make sure we are measuring our neutrons as accurately as possible,” said Masa Ono, the project head of the National Spherical Torus Experiment.

The spherical torus experiment is a small reactor designed to test new approaches to fusion, in which hydrogen atoms are fused together at ultrahigh temperatures to produce energy — as the Sun does. Fusion generates copious numbers of neutrons, which tell how well the reaction is proceeding.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Microwaves are radio waves with frequencies ranging from around 300 million cycles per second (300 MHz) to 3 GHz. RF. A standard measure of exposure for microwave energy is the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) or rate of tissue energy absorption measured in watts per kilogram of tissue.

Microwave radiation leakage can damage human cells and tissues.

All appliances working on electricity produce a toxic electromagnetic field (EMF) of approximately 60 hertz. This is over and above potential microwave leakage from appliances or devices.

Microwave ovens can leak

Microwave leakage is serious enough that the FDA sets strict limits on it for the manufacturers. But once door seals age, leaking tends to exceed those limits, often at head level. That’s bad news, because the microwave energy inside a microwave oven is massive!

Frequency inside your microwave 2.45 BILLION hertz.

Frequency shown to start harming the human body: over 10 hertz

That’s 2.45 billion vs. 10 hertz. It doesn’t take very big leak for the damage to begin. (One top culprit: aging door seals)

The facts about microwaves & cataracts

Eyes are especially vulnerable to microwaves. That’s because unlike other areas of the body, they lack the blood vessels to dissipate the heat and cellular stress.

The first suspected clinical case of microwave-caused cataracts was reported by Hirsch and Parker as early as 1950's. (Sulman 1980).

For decades, cataracts have been reported in workers exposed to this type of radiation. (On the back of the lens where radiation cataracts usually occur.)

What do microwaves do to food?

In a microwave oven, alternating current forces atoms reverse polarity at a startlingly high rate. This creates such violent friction that the water inside the food molecules begin to vibrate and heat up.

The dangers of microwaved foods.

Microwaves break chemical and molecular bonds, and can literally rip atoms apart, disrupting the basic biochemical structures of life. It’s no wonder foods cooked in such a way become so harmful to consume.Government and industry studies suggest they pose no threat, but a growing body of knowledge now contradicts those claims.

Microwaved foods lose nutrition.

The Swiss scientist Hans Hertel, was the first to study microwave dangers, specifically, how cooking degrades and depletes food of nutrients—an effect that shows up in study participants' blood samples.

<|begin_of_text|>Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a class of proteins involved in the metabolism of fats in the body. It is important in Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease.[5]

Lipoproteins are molecules composed of fats and proteins. Apolipoprotein E is a fat-binding protein (apolipoprotein) that is part of the chylomicron and intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDLs). These are essential for the normal processing (catabolism) of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.[6] In peripheral tissues, ApoE is primarily produced by the liver and macrophages, and mediates cholesterol metabolism. In the central nervous system, ApoE is mainly produced by astrocytes and transports cholesterol to neurons via ApoE receptors, which are members of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family.[7] ApoE is the principal cholesterol carrier in the brain.[8] ApoE qualifies as a checkpoint inhibitor of the classical complement pathway by complex formation with activated C1q [9]

Structure [ edit ]

Gene [ edit ]

The gene, APOE, is mapped to chromosome 19 in a cluster with apolipoprotein C1 (APOC-I) and the apolipoprotein C2. The APOE gene consists of four exons and three introns, totaling 3597 base pairs. APOE is transcriptionally activated by the liver X receptor (an important regulator of cholesterol, fatty acid, and glucose homeostasis) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, nuclear receptors that form heterodimers with retinoid X receptors.[10] In melanocytic cells APOE gene expression may be regulated by MITF.[11]

Protein [ edit ]

APOE is 299 amino acids long and contains multiple amphipathic α-helices. According to crystallography studies, a hinge region connects the N- and C-terminal regions of the protein. The N-terminal region (residues 1–167) forms an anti-parallel four-helix bundle such that the non-polar sides face inside the protein. Meanwhile, the C-terminal domain (residues 206–299) contains three α-helices which form a large exposed hydrophobic surface and interact with those in the N-terminal helix bundle domain through hydrogen bonds and salt-bridges. The C-terminal region also contains a low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-binding site.[12]

"Plants don't grow in zero gravity," explains Melchiorri. "NASA is researching different ways to produce oxygen for long-distance space journeys to let us live in space. This material could allow us t0 explore space much further than we can now."

Melchiorri's Silk Leaf project, which he developed as part of the Royal College of Art's Innovation Design Engineering course in collaboration with Tufts University silk lab, consists of chloroplasts suspended in a matrix made out of silk protein.

"The material is extracted directly from the fibres of silk," Melchiorri explains. "This material has an amazing property of stabilising molecules. I extracted chloroplasts from plant cells and placed them inside this silk protein. As an outcome I have the first photosynthetic material that is living and breathing as a leaf does."

Related story "Growing a city from the bottom up" could save the human race

Like the leaves of a plant, all Melchiorri's Silk Leaf needs to produce oxygen is light and a small amount of water.

"Silk Leaf is the first man-made biological leaf," he claims. "It's very light, low energy-consuming, it's completely biological."

"My idea was to use the efficiency of nature in a man-made environment," he explained. "I created some lighting out of this material, using the light to illuminate the house but at the same time to create oxygen for us."

However, Melchiorri says the material could also be used at a much larger scale.

"It could [also] be used for outdoor applications," he says. "So facades, ventilation systems. You can absorb air from outside, pass it through these biological filters and then bring oxygenated air inside."

<|begin_of_text|>This is a ground-breaking philosophical exploration of consciousness and the self as they occur across the states of waking, falling asleep, dreaming, lucid dreaming, deep dreamless sleep, out-of-body experiences and dying. Evan Thompson's rich, beautifully written book interweaves lucid prose with relevant personal anecdotes, bringing the latest neuroscience together with ancient contemplative wisdom to offer valuable insight into the nature of consciousness and the self. The first-person methodologies of Indian and Asian contemplative traditions such as Yoga, Vedānta and Buddhism generate data that go beyond the reach of the standard scientific approach taken by Western neuroscience and psychology, for example on the possible presence of consciousness during deep dreamless sleep. At the same time, the Western scientific and philosophical approach serves to temper some of Indian metaphysical assertions, such as the claim that consciousness does not depend upon the brain. Thompson argues convincingly that the different approaches -- combined to form 'neurophenomenology' -- produce data that reinforce and complement each other, solidifying findings that, from just one perspective, would be more speculative (for example, that a minimal moment of reportable object-directed awareness is 10-20ms). One of main theses to emerge from the study is that the self is a fluid process, not a static thing, nor the illusion of a thing. Like clouds, the 'I-making' enacted self breaks up and re-forms with the different states of being, and like a sunlit sky, the luminous and pure background consciousness is able reveal the workings and contents of both, all the more so if cultivated as a meta-awareness through practices of meditation and mindfulness.

An outstanding feature is the book's accessible presentation of up-to-date empirical data on both neuro-psychological research and its interface with studies on meditation. Thompson is unusually well-placed to write such a book. A meditation practitioner and lucid dreamer himself, he's also a renowned philosopher of mind who has for years been an active participant in dialogues among key players in the field, such as his well-known (now-deceased) mentor the cognitive neuroscientist Francisco Varela, the Dalai Lama and leading meditation neuroscientist Richard Davidson. His philosophical contributions to the field of cognitive science (including several previous books) enable him to synthesise the inter-disciplinary findings in a way that not only offers novel answers to existing questions but, like a tantalising Scrabble word, also opens up the field to provocative questions that invite new directions of critical engagement.

Scientists studying organic remains dating back 2 million years in Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania tracked how plant life adapted to the regional climate as it shifted from regular monsoons to scorching dry spells. The researchers published their findings last week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The gorge was home to some of humanity's earliest hominid ancestors, and the surrounding landscape provides some of the best glimpses of the conditions they lived in from fossil remains, tools, artifacts and plant residues.

"It's an unusual and almost extreme situation," said Gail Ashley a co-author and a professor of earth and planetary sciences at Rutgers University. "[The Olduvai Gorge is] like a perfect environment because it was a closed basin and it filled up with sediment, and those sediments recorded everything around it, just like a book."

It was in these sediments that Ashley and her collaborators found waxes from prehistoric plants and algae, collected in samples over a decade from Olduvai. The team examined residues from 2 million years ago spanning a 200,000-year time frame, around the dawn of Homo erectus.

Clayton Magill, a geochemistry graduate student at Penn State University and a co-author, explained that by measuring isotopes in these waxes, the team painted a picture of what kinds of plants grew in the gorge and what environments they lived in.

"With carbon, we can delineate between grasses and trees," Magill said, noting that different plants have different carbon signatures. Hydrogen isotopes, on the other hand, measure aridity. "Heavier [hydrogen] isotopes are associated with drier conditions," he said. Water with lighter hydrogen isotopes tends to evaporate faster, so plants end up accumulating heavier hydrogen when the ground dries up.

How brain development connects with climate

From these measurements, the researchers traced what kinds of plants grew in the gorge over time and compared them with how the climate changed, constructing a continuous record of plant and water fluctuations. "What we find is that the period between 2 million and 1.8 million years ago is associated with extreme environmental variability," Magill said.

Grasslands gave way to woody forests and back again while water levels in the gorge rose and fell, often very quickly by geological time scales. "There was evidence

Europe's and Russia's new satellite at Mars has sent back its first images of the planet.

The Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) arrived on 19 October, putting itself in a highly elliptical parking orbit.

This must be circularised over the coming year before the mission can begin full science operations.

But scientists have taken the opportunity of some close passes to the planet in recent days to check out the TGO's instrumentation.

Image copyright ESA/Roscosmos/ExoMars/CaSSIS/UniBE Image caption A structure called Arsia Chasmata on the flanks of one of the large volcanoes, Arsia Mons. The width of the image is around 25 km

There is delight at the quality of the pictures returned from camera system, CaSSIS (the Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System).

TGO passed over a region called Hebes Chasma at its closest approach, just 250km from the Martian terrain.

"We saw Hebes Chasma at 2.8 metres per pixel," said Nicolas Thomas, the camera's principal investigator from the University of Bern, Switzerland.

"That's a bit like flying over Bern at 15,000km/h and simultaneously getting sharp pictures of cars in Zurich."

TGO sensors NOMAD and ACS also came through their early tests successfully.

These are the sensors that will make a detailed inventory of Mars' atmospheric gases.

In particular, they will go after the components that constitute less than 1% of the planet's air - chemical species such as methane, water vapour, nitrogen dioxide, and sulphur dioxide.

Methane is the main focus. From previous measurements, its concentration is seen to be low and sporadic in nature. But the mere fact that it is detected at all is really fascinating.

The simple organic molecule should be destroyed easily in the harsh Martian environment, so its persistence - and the occasional spikes in its signal - indicate a replenishing source of the gas.

The speculation is that it could be coming from microbial life somewhere on the planet.

It will be CaSSIS's job to look for possible geological forms on the surface that might tie into methane sources. A fourth instrument, FREND (successfully tested in recent days, too), will sense hydrogen in the near-surface. This data can be used as a proxy for the presence of water or hydrated minerals.

This again is information that could yield answers to the methane question.

<|begin_of_text|>Hi everybody!

After a long time gone I’m slowly getting back into business but with a lot of energy 🙂

Introduction

These past weeks I’ve been solving a couple of coding challenges and for one of them I thought (and I still think) that the best solution would be achieved by using a Graph Db (can’t post details because of confidential reasons). I had a little bit of experience using Neo4j in the past, not an expert though. So I did a bit of research and I found Titan Db which caught my attention as they claim it is a scalable Distributed Graph Database supporting thousand of concurrent users executing complex graph traversals in real time, just what I needed.

So this post will be about creating a small social network twitter-alike (following / followed by) using Titan Db. For those impatient creatures, here’s the code.

Basic Example

In this basic example we have the following relationships:

Gabi is following Damian and John, and is followed by Damian and Mike.

Damian is following Gabi and John, and is followed by Gabi.

John is following Chris, and is followed by Gabi and Damian.

Mike is following Gabi.

Chris is followed by John.

Pretty basic but enough to demonstrate how we can start creating these relationships in Titan Db using the Gremlin Scala DSL.

Introduction to Graph Databases

NOTE: If you’re already familiar with this concept feel free to skip this part.

As described in the Apache TinkerPop website: “A graph is a structure composed of vertices and edges. Both vertices and edges can have an arbitrary number of key/value-pairs called properties. Vertices denote discrete objects such as a person, a place, or an event. Edges denote relationships between vertices. For instance, a person may know another person, have been involved in an event, and/or was recently at a particular place. Properties express non-relational information about the vertices and edges. Example properties include a vertex having a name, an age and an edge having a timestamp and/or a weight. Together, the aforementioned graph is known as a property graph and it is the foundational data structure of Apache TinkerPop”.

So for our example every person will be a Vertex and both relationships “following” and “followedBy” will be Edges. Every person has an Id and a Name which will be Properties of each Vertice.

Relationships in Scala

<|begin_of_text|>Scientific confirmation that the NASA Mars rover Curiosity has found a location habitable to Martian microbial life 3 billion years ago is an historic milestone in planetary exploration.

"This is an incredible adventure to get to this point so early in the mission, I feel giddy," said John Grunsfeld NASA associate administrator for science.

The major finding was made in spite of a weak wisp of organics measured by the rover's instruments, except for a major spike in carbon dioxide from the material when heated to 1,535 deg. F (835 deg. C).

The signatures of more than five hundred mass values were sampled during the heating of this drilled sample and analyzed by the SAM instrument. Five are shown in the graph. These traces are diagnostic of water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and two forms of sulfur, sulfur dioxide, the oxidized form, and hydrogen sulfide, the reduced form. The high deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio in water in the Mars atmosphere is a signature of the lighter hydrogen more rapidly escaping to space over geological time. Credit: NASA/ JPL-Caltech/GSFC.

The new data from the powder drilled from within a rock at Yellowknife Bay indicates that mineralogy, chemistry and abundant fresh water conditions that existed at the time would have supported the existence of prokaryotic organisms.

Such microbes "do not use organics to metabolize, but rather process inorganic compounds for food and energy", said John Grotzinger of Caltech, project scientist for the Mars Science Laboratory.

"There does need to be a source of carbon there somewhere," Grotzinger said. "But if it is just carbon dioxide you can have a "Chemolitho autotrophic organism" that literally feeds on rocks. Such organisms will metabolize and generate organic compounds based on carbon in the carbon dioxide," the project scientist said at a Washington briefing on sample results.

Curiosity's SAM instrument detected the simple carbon-containing compounds chloro- and dichloromethane from the powdered rock sample extracted from the "John Klein" rock on Mars. These species were detected by the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GCMS) on Curiosity's Sample Analysis at Mars instrument.

<|begin_of_text|>[Editor’s note: Back in September, when the Space-X rocket blew up on the pad in Florida, taking the Israeli satellite it was carrying with it, VT was immediately on the ball in reporting what had actually happened, thanks to the expertise we can call on. VT’s Jeff Smith correctly identified the explosion as a nuclear one, not least because of the plainly visible plasma ball.

A little research into the rocket design and it became clear that the helium contained in the rocket had exploded due to the Hohlraum effect that takes place when a container of helium, hydrogen or similar gas undergoes bombardment by radiation, in that case, most likely high intensity x-rays from a new x-ray laser just reaching deployment after having begun development in the 1980s as part of the infamous SDI ‘Star Wars’ programme.

Space-X have now completed their investigation and have revealed that it was indeed the helium tanks that went boom, providing confirmation that VT had been correct in it’s evaluation of the incident. As Jeff commented:

Well it was a helium tank rupture that did it so we were correct on that one; but liquid oxygen and helium don’t burn or turn into hot plasma by themselves. So they left out the ignition source data in the report. Interesting we got a 75% correct conformation.

SpaceX finds cause of explosion that destroyed Israeli satellite

Elon Musk’s SpaceX company announced Monday that it had found the cause of a September launch pad explosion that destroyed a $300 million Israeli communications satellite.

The company’s Falcon rockets have been grounded since the September 1 explosion. SpaceX said in a statement that it expects to return to flight on January 8.

The statement posted on the SpaceX website on said the explosion was caused by the failure of one of three helium tanks, known as composite overwrapped pressure vessels or COPVs, inside the liquid oxygen tank in the rocket’s second stage. The loose liquid oxygen triggered a fuel explosion.

The investigation was overseen by the Federal Aviation Administration, the US Air Force, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the National Transportation Safety Board.

The unmanned SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket was in the midst of a routine fueling test for its scheduled launch when it exploded. The explosion was felt throughout NASA’s Cape Canaveral, Florida facility and for several miles around.

The rocket was scheduled to hoist into orbit the Amos 6 satellite, built by Israel Aerospace Industries and owned by Spacecom Ltd. in partnership with Eut

<|begin_of_text|>The gustatory system creates the human sense of taste, allowing us to perceive different flavors from substances that we consume as food and drink. Gustation, along with olfaction (the sense of smell), is classified as chemoreception. Because it functions by reacting with molecular chemical compounds in a given substance. Specialized cells in the gustatory system that are located on the tongue are called taste buds, and they sense tastants (taste molecules). The taste buds send the information after coming in contact with food from the tastants to the brain, where a molecule is processed as a certain taste. There are five main tastes: bitter, salty, sweet, sour, and umami (savory). All the varieties of flavor we experience are a combination of some or all of these tastes.

The sense of taste is transduced by taste buds. Which are clusters of 50-100 taste receptor cells located in the tongue, soft palate, epiglottis, pharynx, and esophagus. The tongue is the main sensory organ of the gustatory system. The tongue contains papillae, or specialized epithelial cells, which have taste buds on their surface. There are three types of papillae with taste buds in the human gustatory system:

Loading...

fungiform papillae, which are mushroom-shaped and located at the tip of the tongue;

foliate papillae, which are ridges and grooves toward the back of the tongue;

circumvallate papillae, which are circular-shaped and located in a row just in front of the end of the tongue.

You can’t taste food unless it’s mixed with your saliva

Each taste bud is flask-like in shape and formed by two types of cells: supporting cells and gustatory cells. Gustatory cells are short-lived and are continuously regenerating. They each contain a taste pore at the surface of the tongue which is the site of sensory transduction. Though there are small differences in sensation, all taste buds, no matter their location, can respond to all types of taste.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Researchers dream of making miniature, flexible electronic circuits from films just a few atoms thick. But growing such 2D films at the scale needed to produce batches of reliable electronic devices has been a challenge.

Nature podcast Reporter Lizzie Gibney finds a class of materials with exotic properties – but can they one day rival silicon? You may need a more recent browser or to install the latest version of the Adobe Flash Plugin.

Now materials scientists have devised a way to grow single layers of a promising class of 2D semiconductor on silicon wafers that are 10 centimetres across — all the while maintaining the impressive electronic properties seen in smaller samples1. They used the films to make hundreds of transistors, which tests showed worked in 99% of cases.

“Lots of people are trying to grow single layers on this large scale, myself among them,” says Georg Duesberg, a materials scientist at Trinity College Dublin. “But it looks like these guys have really done it.”

The semiconductors in question are known as transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). A single-layer TMD is three atoms thick: it comprises a sheet of atoms from a family of elements called transition metals (which include molybdenum and tungsten) sandwiched between two layers of chalcogen atoms (such as sulfur, selenium and tellurium).

Like their carbon-based cousin graphene, TMD sheets are strong, thin and flexible and conduct electrons. But unlike graphene, they are also semiconductors — meaning that the flow of electrons can be easily switched off and on. TMDs are unlikely ever to replace the most famous semiconductor, silicon, whose manufacture has been honed over decades. But they could form films more than a thousand times thinner than today's components made from silicon slabs, allowing for flexible transistors, displays, and light detectors.

Large layers

TMD layers can be peeled from a multi-layered crystal, much as graphene can be pulled from graphite with sticky tape. But the results can be inconsistent and the process is time consuming. An alternative — growing the material atom by atom from a gas of precursor chemicals — has so far produced only small-area samples that are often more than one layer thick.

Publishing in Nature1 on 29 April, Jiwoong Park at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and his colleagues have adapted this technique to grow large single-layer films. Over 26 hours and at a temperature of 550 °C,

Airbus has released pictures of the recent "drop test" it conducted for its spaceplane concept.

The one-quarter-scale demonstrator was released from a height of 3,000m to learn more about how a real vehicle might behave as it returned to Earth.

The Airbus project has been on a slow burn since being announced in 2007.

If it were ever to go into production, the plane would be aimed at the tourism market, to take passengers on short hops above the atmosphere.

The drop test took place in May, just off the coast of Singapore and was supported by the Singapore Economic Development Board.

It involved a helicopter lifting the model off a barge and then carrying it aloft.

On release, the demonstrator descended under the control of a remote pilot based back on the support vessel.

Ships recovered the model after it ditched in the ocean.

Engineers need to understand how a real vehicle will handle through all its flight phases. The Singapore experiment informs them about the late stages of a mission.

That data can then be fed back into the computer models used to further the design process.

Image copyright Airbus Image caption The model was controlled remotely from the support barge

Airbus announced its spaceplane project with great fanfare in the June of 2007, but then had to scale back its vision when the global financial crisis took hold.

But the company's Defence and Space division has never given up on the idea, and development work has continued on various aspects of the concept ever since, including on the rocket engine that would take the craft to sub-orbital altitudes.

This would burn a mix of methane and oxygen.

Unlike the much-talked-about Virgin spaceplane, the Airbus counterpart would take off from a standard runway using off-the-shelf turbofan jets. In many ways, it would resemble an executive jet.

Only when the vehicle reached its "launch" altitude would it ignite the methane-oxygen rocket to complete the ascent to over 100km.

The Virgin approach, in contrast, will use a carrier jet to lift a rocket plane to the launch altitude.

Airbus Defence and Space programme manager Christophe Chavagnac told BBC News: "We have now reached a point where the advanced project is completed - that is, the basic requirements are there.

"Now, we are preparing to shift to the next pre-development phase, and we're currently concentrating on a set of technology demonstrations for the sake of not

<|begin_of_text|>As we know from our history books, the War for Independence began with the shots fired at Lexington and Concord. Those shots required gunpowder, a substance that was in short supply throughout the colonies. In 1775 there was only one American gunpowder mill, the Frankford Mill in Pennsylvania, and it was turning out a miniscule amount compared to what would be needed to wage a successful war.[1] In addition, this mill was not turning out the high-quality powder needed for artillery use. If the Patriots were going to have any chance of victory, the colonies needed to step up production or import it. Had it not been for the French assistance in supplying the Americans with gunpowder from 1776 throughout the war, American forces would not have been able to fight and win the battles that they did.

Gunpowder is a mixture of sulfur, charcoal, and potassium nitrate that must be combined in specific ratios. While this sounds simple enough, it must be remembered that in 1775 the state of chemistry was rudimentary. Potassium nitrate itself is a compound of nitrogen and potassium, neither element of which had been identified at that point in time.[2] What they did know was that what they called “nitre” was needed, which, in some recipes, involved soaking soil in urine from both animals and humans, and then allowing it to dry. The dried urine-soil was then boiled to produce saltpeter. Not all recipes agreed with this method which added to the problems in making gunpowder. Unfortunately this required half a year or more to produce nitre-bearing soil and created a bottleneck in the production of gunpowder in America.

When the War for Independence started American supplies of powder were what they had gathered from Royal sources or their own local supplies. The amount was not enough to sustain an army in the field. While Congress was hopeful that they could establish enough mills to create their own self-sustaining sources of gunpowder, they also decided to seek additional supplies from overseas which meant European suppliers. The Journals of the Continental Congress are full of references to purchasing gunpowder in the West Indies. To do so meant selling American goods which involved adjusting the rules under the Association agreement of 1774. As several congressional delegates noted, gunpowder was needed or else the whole enterprise was lost. A Secret Committee was set up on September 19, 1775 to contract and agree to importation of gunpowder not to exceed 500 tons.[3]

Don’t be fooled by the title; the mysterious, almost mystical bright light emerging from these thick, ominous clouds is actually a telltale sign of forming stars.

Here, a very young star is being born in the guts of the dark cloud LDN 43 – a massive blob of gas, dust and ices, gathered 520 light-years from Earth in the constellation of Ophiuchus, The Serpent Bearer.

Stars are born from cosmic dust and gas, which float freely in space until gravity forces it to bind together. The newborn star, RNO 91, is hidden in this image, revealed only by light reflected onto the plumes of the dark cloud. It is what astronomers call a pre-main sequence star, meaning that it has not yet started burning hydrogen in its core.

The energy that allows RNO 91 to shine comes from gravitational contraction – the star is being compressed by its own weight. Once a critical mass is reached, hydrogen, its main component, will begin to fuse together, releasing huge amounts of energy in the process. This will mark the beginning of adulthood for the star.

But even before this happens the adolescent star is bright enough to shine and generate powerful stellar winds, emitting intense X-ray and radio emission.

RNO 91 is a variable star around half the mass of the Sun. Astronomers have already seen a dusty, icy disc surrounding it, stretching out to over 1700 times the distance from Earth to the Sun. It is believed that this disc may host planet embryos, and that it will eventually evolve into a fully-fledged planetary system.

A step closer to affordable water desalination

The defence contractor, Lockheed Martin, has reported a new method for desalination that is vastly cheaper and more efficient, using nanotechnology.

Lockheed Martin has been awarded a patent for "Perforene" – a new molecular filtration system that is designed to meet the growing global demand for potable water. This material works by removing sodium, chlorine and other ions from seawater and other sources.

Dr. Ray Johnson, senior vice president and chief technology officer: "Access to clean drinking water is going to become more critical as the global population continues to grow, and we believe that this simple and affordable solution will be a game-changer for the industry. Perforene... is just one example of Lockheed Martin's efforts to apply some of the advanced materials that we have developed for our core markets, including aircraft and spacecraft, to global environmental and economic challenges."

According to a UN report last year, over 780 million people around the world do not have access to clean drinking water. Tom Notaro, Lockheed business manager for advanced materials: "One of the areas that we're very concerned about in terms of global security is the access to clean and affordable drinking water. As more and more countries become more developed... access to that water for their daily lives is becoming more and more critical."

Perforene was developed by placing holes that are one nanometre or less in a membrane of graphene. These are small enough to trap ions while dramatically improving the flow-through of water molecules, reducing clogging and pressure. Being just one atom thick, graphene is both strong and durable, making it far more effective at sea water desalination at a fraction of the cost of traditional reverse osmosis systems.

John Stetson, senior engineer: "It's 500 times thinner than the best filter on the market today and 1,000 times stronger. The energy that's required and the pressure that's required to filter salt is approximately 100 times less."

In addition to desalination, the Perforene membrane can be tailored to other applications – including capturing minerals, through the selection of the size of hole placed in the material to filter or capture a specific size particle of interest. Lockheed Martin has also been developing processes that will allow the material to be produced at scale. The company is now seeking commercialisation partners.

Blue Light Observations Indicate Water-Rich Atmosphere of a Super-Earth

September 3, 2013

A Japanese research team of astronomers and planetary scientists has used Subaru Telescope's two optical cameras, Suprime-Cam and the Faint Object Camera and Spectrograph (FOCAS), with a blue transmission filter to observe planetary transits of super-Earth GJ 1214 b (Gilese 1214 b) (Figure 1). The team investigated whether this planet has an atmosphere rich in water or hydrogen. The Subaru observations show that the sky of this planet does not show a strong Rayleigh scattering feature, which a cloudless hydrogen-dominated atmosphere would predict. When combined with the findings of previous observations in other colors, this new observational result implies that GJ 1214 b is likely to have a water-rich atmosphere.

Super-Earths are emerging as a new type of exoplanet (i.e., a planet orbiting a star outside of our Solar System) with a mass and radius larger than the Earth's but less than those of ice giants in our Solar System, such as Uranus or Neptune. Whether super-Earths are more like a "large Earth" or a "small Uranus" is unknown, since scientists have yet to determine their detailed properties. The current Japanese research team of astronomers and planetary scientists focused their efforts on investigating the atmospheric features of one super-Earth, GJ 1214 b, which is located 40 light years from Earth in the constellation Ophiuchus, northwest of the center of our Milky Way galaxy. This planet is one of the well-known super-Earths discovered by Charbonneau et. al. (2009) in the MEarth Project, which focuses on finding habitable planets around nearby small stars. The current team's research examined features of light scattering of GJ 1214 b's transit around its star.

Current theory posits that a planet develops in a disk of dense gas surrounding a newly formed star (i.e., a protoplanetary disk). The element hydrogen is a major component of a protoplanetary disk, and water ice is abundant in an outer region beyond a so-called "snow

<|begin_of_text|>This article is about air conditioning. For similar concept in atomic physics, see Evaporative cooling (atomic physics)

An evaporative cooler (also swamp cooler, swamp box, desert cooler and wet air cooler) is a device that cools air through the evaporation of water. Evaporative cooling differs from typical air conditioning systems, which use vapor-compression or absorption refrigeration cycles. Evaporative cooling uses the fact that water will absorb a relatively large amount of heat in order to evaporate (that is, it has a large enthalpy of vaporization). The temperature of dry air can be dropped significantly through the phase transition of liquid water to water vapor (evaporation). This can cool air using much less energy than refrigeration. In extremely dry climates, evaporative cooling of air has the added benefit of conditioning the air with more moisture for the comfort of building occupants.

The cooling potential for evaporative cooling is dependent on the wet-bulb depression, the difference between dry-bulb temperature and wet-bulb temperature (see relative humidity). In arid climates, evaporative cooling can reduce energy consumption and total equipment for conditioning as an alternative to compressor-based cooling. In climates not considered arid, indirect evaporative cooling can still take advantage of the evaporative cooling process without increasing humidity. Passive evaporative cooling strategies can offer the same benefits of mechanical evaporative cooling systems without the complexity of equipment and ductwork.

qanat, used for evaporative cooling of buildings Schematic diagram of an ancient Iranian windcatcher and, used for evaporative cooling of buildings

An earlier form of evaporative cooling, the windcatcher, was first used in ancient Egypt and Persia thousands of years ago in the form of wind shafts on the roof. They caught the wind, passed it over subterranean water in a qanat and discharged the cooled air into the building. Modern Iranians have widely adopted powered evaporative coolers (coolere âbi).[1]

The evaporative cooler was the subject of numerous US patents in the 20th century; many of these, starting in 1906,[2] suggested or assumed the use of excelsior (wood wool) pads as the elements to bring a large volume of water in contact with moving air to allow evaporation to occur. A typical design, as shown in a 1945 patent, includes a water reservoir (usually with level controlled by a float valve), a pump to circulate water over the excelsior pads and

<|begin_of_text|>The microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS) is an alternate pathway of ethanol metabolism that occurs in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum in the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde. While playing only a minor role in ethanol metabolism in average individuals, MEOS activity increases after chronic alcohol consumption. The MEOS pathway requires the CYP2E1 enzyme, part of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes, to convert ethanol to acetaldehyde. Ethanol’s affinity for CYP2E1 is lower than its affinity for alcohol dehydrogenase. It has delayed activity in non-chronic alcohol consumption states as increase in MEOS activity is correlated with an increase in production of CYP2E1, seen most conclusively in alcohol dehydrogenase negative deer mice.[1]

The MEOS pathway converts ethanol to acetaldehyde by way of a redox reaction. In this reaction, ethanol is oxidized (losing two hydrogens) and O 2 is reduced (by accepting hydrogen) to form H 2 O. NADPH is used as donor of hydrogen, forming NADP+.[2] This process consumes ATP and dissipates heat, thus leading to the hypothesis that long term drinkers see an increase in resting energy expenditure.[3]

The increase in rest energy expenditure has, according to some studies, been explained by indicating that the MEOS "expends" nine calories per gram of ethanol to metabolize versus 7 calories per gram of ethanol ingested. This results in a net loss of 2 calories per gram of ethanol ingested.

Over the past few years aerospace 3D printing has really been taking off, and especially NASA is seeming to use this technology in just about every aspect of their Mission to Mars – from prototyping, to in-space parts manufacturing and even to manufacturing actual engine parts to send spacecraft into space. And they seem to be particularly successful in that latter goal, as they have just tested a completely 3D printed rocket engine. During the successful tests, the engine used cryogenic liquid hydrogen and oxygen to produce 20,000 pounds of thrust.

It thus seems that the future of 3D printing in space exploration is ensured. NASA has previously extensively discussed the advantages of the technology, especially as a cost-saving tool for lengthy exploration missions. That does require, however, a technology capable of producing vital spacecraft parts and that is what these tests are all about. NASA previously tested a 3D printed turbopump for rocket propulsion, at the same test facility at their Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

However, this new test is particularly interesting because of the amount of 3D printed parts involved. “We manufactured and then tested about 75 percent of the parts needed to build a 3D printed rocket engine,” said Elizabeth Robertson, the project manager for the additively manufactured demonstrator engine said on the NASA website. “By testing the turbopumps, injectors and valves together, we’ve shown that it would be possible to build a 3-D printed engine for multiple purposes such as landers, in-space propulsion or rocket engine upper stages.”

This engine is part of a greater program for the development of 3D printed parts, which has been ongoing for the past three years. While most have been tested individually or as part of greater non-3D printed setups, this test involved lots of 3D printed parts operating together – as they would in a typical engine. “In engineering lingo, this is called a breadboard engine,” explained Nick Case, the testing lead at the project. “What matters is that the parts work the same way as they do in a conventional engine and perform under the extreme temperatures and pressures found inside a rocket engine. The turbopump got its “heartbeat” racing at more than 90,000 revolutions per minute (rpm) and the end result is the flame you see coming out of the thrust chamber to produce over 20,000 pounds of thrust, and an engine like this could produce enough power for an

He records a personal greeting for two schoolgirls embarking on their first play. And another one. And another one.

If I hadn’t known before that the star of Sherlock and Star Trek: Into Darkness was the most popular man in Britain, I’d know it now.

He finally bids his fan club farewell: “Not at all,” he tells them. “One of the perks of the job.”

He bounds over and reaches for a giant dark chocolate Toblerone. “I am sorry,” he tells me with a firm handshake. “But I do need sugar.” He politely pushes the big triangle into the side of his mouth so that he can keep talking. The effect is to sharpen his already razor-like cheekbones. “I wish there was a more decorous way of doing this,” he smiles.

I can’t think of one. This is exactly how I would expect a Mitford sister to eat polyhedral- shaped confectionary if they had lately been accosted by Cumberbitches. But the 38-year-old can’t find cause to complain.

“You have to pinch yourself,” he says cheerfully. “To have a professional life where you get to tell stories and people respond? It’s kind of wonderful. Magic, actually.”

Not that Cumberbatch is impressed by celebrity. Even his own. BBC’s Sherlock has catapulted him to the top of Sexiest Man Alive and Britain’s Greatest Thespian polls. But such things are of little consequence to Benedict Timothy Carlton Cumberbatch.

“However lost in showbiz someone can get, I’ve never met anyone who really believes that that’s all there is,” he says. “Can you imagine what a dead end that would be artistically? How could you feed your head like that?”

Benedict Cumberbatch is a thinker. He practises mindfulness and meditation. After Harrow, he spent his gap year reading The Tao of Physics while teaching English in a Tibetan Buddhist monastery in Darjeeling. Between gigs he likes to draw and stare at the moon.

“I like to think that our atoms are made of stardust,” he muses. “I like to think that we’re revolving on this planet and revolving through the galaxy. I love having context that’s so much

<|begin_of_text|>Several fundamental ideas in calculus are more than 2000 years old. As a formal subdiscipline of mathematics, calculus was first introduced and developed in the late 1600s, with key independent contributions from Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Mathematicians agree that the subject has been understood rigorously since the work of Augustin Louis Cauchy and Karl Weierstrass in the mid 1800s when the field of modern analysis was developed, in part to make sense of the infinitely small quantities on which calculus rests. Hence, as a body of knowledge calculus has been completely understood by experts for at least 150 years. The discipline is one of our great human intellectual achievements: among many spectacular ideas, calculus models how objects fall under the forces of gravity and wind resistance, explains how to compute areas and volumes of interesting shapes, enables us to work rigorously with infinitely small and infinitely large quantities, and connects the varying rates at which quantities change to the total change in the quantities themselves.While each author of a calculus textbook certainly offers her own creative perspective on the subject, it is hardly the case that many of the ideas she presents are new. Indeed, the mathematics community broadly agrees on what the main ideas of calculus are, as well as their justification and their importance; the core parts of nearly all calculus textbooks are very similar. As such, it is our opinion that in the 21st century – an age where the internet permits seamless and immediate transmission of information – no one should be required to purchase a calculus text to read, to use for a class, or to find a coherent collection of problems to solve. Calculus belongs to humankind, not any individual author or publishing company. Thus, the main purpose of this work is to present a new calculus text that is free. In addition, instructors who are looking for a calculus text should have the opportunity to download the source files and make modifications that they see fit; thus this text is open-source. Since August 2013, Active Calculus has been endorsed by the American Institute of Mathematics and its Open Textbook Initiative<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>The DZero collaboration at Fermilab on Thursday announced the discovery of a new particle whose quark content appears to be qualitatively different from normal.

An ordinary meson is composed of a quark and an antiquark, whereas an ordinary baryon is made from three quarks. Physicists have long conjectured that exotic particles containing an additional quark-antiquark pair could exist, and a handful of candidates have been seen. Such particles, called tetraquarks, or their close relatives, the pentaquarks, would be exotic states forming a new particle species paralleling the ordinary mesons and baryons.

DZero searched for new exotic states decaying into a B s meson and a pi meson. Both of these are well-known mesons, which travel finite distances before decaying via the weak nuclear interaction. The B s meson is composed of a quark and an antiquark of bottom and strange types, and the pi meson has an up and down quark and antiquark.

The study, using the full data set acquired at the Tevatron collider from 2002 to 2011 totaling 10 inverse femtobarns, identified the B s meson through its decay into intermediate J/psi and phi mesons, which subsequently decayed into a pair of oppositely charged muons and a pair of oppositely charged K mesons respectively (see diagram).

The plot of the mass distribution of the B s and pi meson combination (see the mass plot) shows an excess of 133 ± 31 events over the estimated background, with a mass of 5,568 MeV. The mass peak of the new state, called X(5568), is relatively broad (22 MeV) indicating that the particle decays via the strong interaction. The probability that previously known processes could have fluctuated to give a signal as strong as that seen is only 1 in about 6 million (5.1 standard deviation significance), after taking into account the estimated uncertainties in the analysis and the possibility that such a fluctuation could have occurred anywhere within the search window.

The fact that the new X(5568) particle decays via the strong interaction into a B s and pi mesons tells us that it contains four distinct flavors of quarks and antiquarks – bottom, strange, up and down. Several other previously observed particles are good candidates to be tetraquark or pentaquark states, but all of these have a

<|begin_of_text|>The world authority on chemical nomenclature is preparing to scrap the familiar hydrogen bond definition, in light of recent evidence about its true nature. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry’s (Iupac’s) Physical and Biophysical Chemistry Division has now published its proposal for the revised definition, and the chemical community has until the end of March 2011 to respond. Barring significant objections, it will be adopted shortly thereafter.

Two key factors are motivating the bonding interaction’s redefinition. One is a shift in the traditional view that a hydrogen bond is a purely electrostatic attraction between dipoles or charges on a hydrogen and another, electronegative, atom. Elangannan Arunan, who co-chairs the Iupac group assigned to categorise hydrogen bonds and other intermolecular interactions, highlights that there is a variety of evidence, including nuclear magnetic resonance data, that some electron density is shared between them. ’This shows that the hydrogen bond has a covalent nature,’ he says.

The current classification also concentrates on fluorine, oxygen and nitrogen, which Arunan says research has been shown as too simplistic. ’Most existing definitions insist hydrogen is connected to the most electronegative atoms,’ he tells Chemistry World. ’That is far from complete now.’ Arunan points out that Richard Nelmes at the University of Edinburgh, UK discovered that solid hydrogen sulfide has a hydrogen bonding structure resembling ice. ’That’s what really shocked chemists,’ he says.

Arunan’s own research, at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, has demonstrated that hydrogen sulfide molecules can hydrogen bond with ethylene. He also notes that methane, noble gases like krypton, and unpaired-electron radical species have been seen as hydrogen’s bonding partner.

A 14 member group including hydrogen bonding textbook authors like Utah State University’s Steve Scheiner and Arunan’s Bangalore colleague Gautam Desiraju has been developing the latest classification since 2004. Arunan hopes that their combined contribution will help minimise any controversy. ’Hydrogen bonding is not string theory or gravitons, which no-one has ever seen yet,’ he emphasises. ’There are plenty of experimental and theoretical results available.’

Slawomir Grabowski, a hydrogen bonding expert at the University of the Basque Country in Spain underlines that Nobel laureate Linus Pauling originated the best-used current definition in 1960. ’The change of definition is needed,’ he tells Chemistry World, ’but because of the broad

HOW IT WORKS

The small scanner contains a spectrometer. Light is made up of particles called photons. When you beam the low-powered laser in the TellSpec scanner at the food, some of the photons are absorbed, raising the energy states of the molecules in the food. Lower energy photons are then reflected back.

The spectrometer inside the TellSpec scanner sorts these photons by wavelength and counts them. The resulting numbers, called a spectrum, describe the chemical compounds in the food. This spectrum is uploaded to a web server where it is analysed. Information about the allergens, chemicals, nutrients, calories, and ingredients in the food is then downloaded to you and displayed on your mobile phone.

UC Riverside-led astrobiology team discovers that methane, a potent greenhouse gas, was not the climate savior once imagined for the mysterious middle chapter of Earth history

RIVERSIDE, Calif. (www.ucr.edu) — For at least a billion years of the distant past, planet Earth should have been frozen over but wasn’t. Scientists thought they knew why, but a new modeling study from the Alternative Earths team of the NASA Astrobiology Institute has fired the lead actor in that long-accepted scenario.

Humans worry about greenhouse gases, but between 1.8 billion and 800 million years ago, microscopic ocean dwellers really needed them. The sun was 10 to 15 percent dimmer than it is today—too weak to warm the planet on its own. Earth required a potent mix of heat-trapping gases to keep the oceans liquid and livable.

For decades, atmospheric scientists cast methane in the leading role. The thinking was that methane, with 34 times the heat-trapping capacity of carbon dioxide, could have reigned supreme for most of the first 3.5 billion years of Earth history, when oxygen was absent initially and little more than a whiff later on. (Nowadays oxygen is one-fifth of the air we breathe, and it destroys methane in a matter of years.)

“A proper accounting of biogeochemical cycles in the oceans reveals that methane has a much more powerful foe than oxygen,” said Stephanie Olson, a graduate student at the University of California, Riverside, a member of the Alternative Earths team and lead author of the new study published September 26 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “You can’t get significant methane out of the ocean once there is sulfate.”

Sulfate wasn’t a factor until oxygen appeared in the atmosphere and triggered oxidative weathering of rocks on land. The breakdown of minerals such as pyrite produces sulfate, which then flows down rivers to the oceans. Less oxygen means less sulfate, but even 1 percent of the modern abundance is sufficient to kill methane, Olson said.

Algal blooms that feed on nutrient-rich manure and fertilizer runoff can deplete oxygen in the water when they die, creating inhospitable dead zones -- but the same green scum might also serve as a preventive solution upstream. A microbiologist with the U.S. Agricultural Research Service used algae to recover almost 100 percent of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients from manure, and suggested that the dried-out algae can then act as slow-release fertilizer for farms.

The solution offers better management of the cycle of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients which plants depend on. Experiments have shown that algae can capture 60 to 90 percent of nitrogen and 70 to 100 percent of phosphorus from a mixture of manure and fresh water, as proved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on four dairy farms.

The system is practicable now. Farmers would have to set up algal turf scrubber (ATS) raceways covered with nylon netting to serve as a platform for algae to grow upon. The capture costs of around $5 to $6 per pound of nitrogen and $25 per pound of phosphorus is about the same as other manure-management practices.

But Walter Mulbry, the USDA microbiologist, also showed that corn and cucumber seedlings could thrive on an organic fertilizer made from the dried-out algae. That might allow farmers to recoup even more of the costs from the ATS system, or perhaps turn a profit if the price is right.

Mulbry has already begun another study to see whether fertilizer made from chicken and poultry litter can also benefit from the algae cleanup system. And he has also begun studying whether the ATS systems can remove nitrogen and phosphorus from estuaries that flow into the Chesapeake Bay, so that they could clean up runoff that has already made it into the water system.

Algae's versatility has already won over scientists who see it as the biofuel of the future, and the tiny plant organisms have also been proving their worth in scrubbing carbon dioxide and nitrous gas from industrial smokestacks. A company called Algenol has even looked to using algae-derived plastic as a replacement for petroleum-derived plastic.

Even the U.S. Department of Energy and various branches of the U.S. military have begun seriously exploring algae-derived solutions. If that doesn't entirely ensure a clean future, it at least suggests a future with a scummy

Since the industrialization of coal, the world has sourced much of its energy from fossil fuels. While the global energy landscape has started to change again over the past several years, with the introduction of more renewable and cleaner sources, fossil fuels are still the main source of much of today’s energy. However, it looks like China has now found a way to access a previously elusive source of energy.

Reports from China’s Ministry of Land and Resources claim that the country has successfully extracted methane hydrate — also known as “flammable ice” — from beneath the South China Sea, just 300 kilometers (186 miles) southeast of Hong Kong.

“We brought the gas to the surface and have lit it up since May 10. By now, the drill has been running continually for eight days,” project leader and deputy chief engineer at the China Geological Survey Ye Jianliang told the South China Morning Post. “The daily output [of gas] exceeds 10,000 cubic meters. The best day recorded 35,000 cubic meters.”

Not Clean Enough

Though methane hydrate is not a new discovery, researchers have had difficulty putting it to practical use. The substance is called “flammable ice” because it looks like ice, but it’s actually methane trapped inside water molecule lattices. Deposits of methane hydrate are usually found in areas with low temperatures and moderate pressure, such as the bottom of the ocean, making them difficult to access.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

A photogenic and favorite target for amateur astronomers, the full beauty of nearby barred spiral galaxy M83 is unveiled in all of its glory in this Hubble Space Telescope mosaic image. The vibrant magentas and blues reveal that the galaxy is ablaze with star formation. The galaxy, also known as the Southern Pinwheel, lies 15 million light-years away in the constellation Hydra.

The Hubble photograph captures thousands of star clusters, hundreds of thousands of individual stars, and “ghosts” of dead stars called supernova remnants. The galactic panorama unveils a tapestry of the drama of stellar birth and death spread across 50,000 light-years.

The newest generations of stars are forming largely in clusters on the edges of the dark spiral dust lanes. These brilliant young stellar groupings, only a few million years old, produce huge amounts of ultraviolet light that is absorbed by surrounding diffuse gas clouds, causing them to glow in pinkish hydrogen light.

Gradually, the fierce stellar winds from the youngest most massive stars blow away the gas, revealing bright blue star clusters and giving a “Swiss cheese” appearance to the spiral arms. These youngest star clusters are about 1 million to 10 million years old. The populations of stars up to 100 million years or older appear yellow or orange by comparison because the young blue stars have already burned out.

Interstellar “bubbles” produced by nearly 300 supernovas from massive stars have been found in this Hubble image. By studying these supernova remnants, astronomers can better understand the nature of the stars that exploded and dispersed nuclear processed chemical elements back into the galaxy, contributing to the next generation of new stars.

This image is being used to support a citizen science project titled STAR DATE: M83. The primary goal is to estimate ages for approximately 3,000 star clusters. Amateur scientists will use the presence or absence of the pink hydrogen emission, the sharpness of the individual stars, and the color of the clusters to estimate ages. Participants will measure the sizes of the star clusters and any associated emission nebulae. Finally, the citizen scientists will “explore” the image, identifying a variety of objects ranging from background galaxies to supernova remnants to foreground stars.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Researchers in Germany and the Czech Republic have improved the clarity of atomic force microscopy (AFM) to probe the distribution of charges within atoms and molecules. The new ability could help in the design of solar cells, by unmasking the generation of charge carriers and how they hop to and from electrodes.

Normal AFM relies on the dynamics of a tiny oscillating cantilever, which is scanned over a surface under study. By monitoring the resonant frequency of the cantilever, a scientist can determine, with nanometer resolution, the shape and makeup of any surface features.

A variant of AFM is Kelvin probe force spectroscopy (KPFS), in which the cantilever’s tip applies a bias voltage to a surface. By varying the voltage, a researcher can measure that surface’s local work function – that is, the strength with which the surface holds on to electrons. KPFS might also be precise enough to map the distribution of charges within molecules, but this would require the cantilever tip to be brought very close to a sample where the influence of other chemical forces is uncertain.

Now Jascha Repp’s group at the University of Regensburg, together with colleagues at the Institute of Physics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, has determined exactly what these influences are, and how to overcome them. They studied two molecules that exhibited various charge distributions within chemical bonds, trimeric perfluoro-ortho-phenylene mercury (F 12 C 18 Hg 3 ) and its hydrogen-terminated counterpart (H 12 C 18 Hg 3 ). As the researchers performed KPFS closer and closer to the molecules, they found that the apparent charge distribution in the bonds was distorted by chemical attractions between certain atoms and the cantilever tip.

The way around this, the team found, is to measure the force on the cantilever as a function of proximity for two different bias voltages. That way, it was possible to cancel out any unwanted contributions from chemical forces.

Physicist Leo Gross, who develops AFM and other types of microscopy at the IBM Research Laboratory in Zurich, Switzerland, calls the result a ‘great achievement’. ‘Probably this technique will be applied and further refined in the future,’ he says.

Repp believes one of the first applications of the refined KPFS could be organic solar cells. ‘Relatively little is known about some things, like where exactly the charges are generated, or how they hop from one molecule to another or to the electrodes,’ he says. ‘There, [

<|begin_of_text|>As solar panels become less expensive and capable of generating more power, solar energy is becoming a more commercially viable alternative source of electricity. However, the photovoltaic cells now used to turn sunlight into electricity can only absorb and use a small fraction of that light, and that means a significant amount of solar energy goes untapped.

A new technology created by researchers from Caltech, and described in a paper published online in the October 30 issue of Science Express, represents a first step toward harnessing that lost energy.

Sunlight is composed of many wavelengths of light. In a traditional solar panel, silicon atoms are struck by sunlight and the atoms' outermost electrons absorb energy from some of these wavelengths of sunlight, causing the electrons to get excited. Once the excited electrons absorb enough energy to jump free from the silicon atoms, they can flow independently through the material to produce electricity. This is called the photovoltaic effect -- a phenomenon that takes place in a solar panel's photovoltaic cells.

Although silicon-based photovoltaic cells can absorb light wavelengths that fall in the visible spectrum -- light that is visible to the human eye -- longer wavelengths such as infrared light pass through the silicon. These wavelengths of light pass right through the silicon and never get converted to electricity -- and in the case of infrared, they are normally lost as unwanted heat.

"The silicon absorbs only a certain fraction of the spectrum, and it's transparent to the rest. If I put a photovoltaic module on my roof, the silicon absorbs that portion of the spectrum, and some of that light gets converted into power. But the rest of it ends up just heating up my roof," says Harry A. Atwater, the Howard Hughes Professor of Applied Physics and Materials Science; director, Resnick Sustainability Institute, who led the study.

Now, Atwater and his colleagues have found a way to absorb and make use of these infrared waves with a structure composed not of silicon, but entirely of metal.

The new technique they've developed is based on a phenomenon observed in metallic structures known as plasmon resonance. Plasmons are coordinated waves, or ripples, of electrons that exist on the surfaces of metals at the point where the metal meets the air.

While the plasmon resonances of metals are predetermined in nature, Atwater and his colleagues found that those resonances are capable of being tuned to other wavelengths when the metals are made into tiny nanostructures in the lab.

"Normally in a metal like silver or copper or gold, the density of electrons in that metal is

The movie, titled "A Boy and His Atom," consists of nearly 250 frames of stop-motion action and tells the simple story of a boy named Atom who dances and plays with an atom. By drawing viewers in with the film (a technological marvel that will no doubt be passed around far and wide), IBM then uses an engrossing behind-the-scenes clip to tell its larger story—about how the company has worked at the nanoscale for decades to explore the limits of data storage, among other things with real-world applications.

Andreas Heinrich, a principle investigator at IBM Research, is the most eloquent voice of the project. "Capturing, positioning and shaping atoms to create an original motion picture on the atomic level is a precise science and entirely novel," he says. "At IBM, researchers don't just read about science, we do it. This movie is a fun way to share the atomic-scale world and show everyday people the challenges and fun science can create."

The consequences of IBM's research at the atomic level are also put into useful context—using, fittingly enough, the movies as a gauge. Today's electronic devices need roughly 1 million atoms to store a single bit of data. But IBM researchers have shown that only 12 atoms are actually needed to store one bit. The implications for data storage are astonishing—it means that one day, every movie ever made could be stored in a device the size of a fingernail.

While IBM works on that, it hopes this movie accomplishes a simpler goal: getting kids to love science. As Heinrich says: "If I can do this by making a movie, and I can get a thousand kids to join science rather than go into law school, I'd be super happy."

It is easy to see how this arrogance comes. The genius is a genius by the first look he casts on any object. Is his eye creative? Does he not rest in angles and colors, but beholds the design?- he will presently undervalue the actual object. In powerful moments, his thought has dissolved the works of art and nature into their causes, so that the works appear heavy and faulty. He has a conception of beauty which the sculptor cannot embody. Picture, statue, temple, railroad, steam-engine, existed first in an artist's mind, without flaw, mistake, or friction, which impair the executed models. So did the Church, the State, college, court, social circle, and all the institutions. It is not strange that these men, remembering what they have seen and hoped of ideas, should affirm disdainfully the superiority of ideas. Having at some time seen that the happy soul will carry all the arts in power, they say, Why cumber ourselves with superfluous realizations? and like dreaming beggars they assume to speak and act as if these values were already substantiated.

A new look at data from the Mars Viking landers concludes that the two landers may have found the building blocks of life on the Red Planet after all way back in 1976. The surprise discovery of perchlorates by the Phoenix mission on Mars 32 years later could mean the way the Viking experiment was set up actually would have destroyed any carbon-based chemical building blocks of life – what the experiment set about to try and find.

“This doesn’t say anything about the question of whether or not life has existed on Mars, but it could make a big difference in how we look for evidence to answer that question,” said Chris McKay of NASA’s Ames Research Center. McKay coauthored a study published online by the Journal of Geophysical Research – Planets, reanalyzing results of Viking’s tests for organic chemicals in Martian soil.

The Viking lander scooped up some soil, put it in a tiny oven and heated the sample. The only organic chemicals identified in the Martian soil from that experiment chloromethane and dichloromethane — chlorine compounds interpreted at the time as likely contaminants from cleaning fluids used on the spacecraft before it left Earth. But those chemicals are exactly what the new study found when a little perchlorate — the surprise finding from Phoenix — was added to desert soil from Chile containing organics and analyzed in the manner of the Viking tests.

“Our results suggest that not only organics, but also perchlorate, may have been present in the soil at both Viking landing sites,” said the study’s lead author, Rafael Navarro-González of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City.

The Viking experiment results have been rather controversial over the years. There are some scientists who say the experiment actually did find evidence for life, and others who say the results were inconclusive.

McKay said that organics can come from non-biological or biological sources. Many meteorites raining onto Mars and Earth for the past 5 billion years contain organics. Even if Mars has never had life, scientists before Viking anticipated that Martian soil would contain organics from meteorites.

“The lack of organics was a big surprise from the Vikings,” McKay said. “But for 30 years we were looking at a jigsaw puzzle with a piece missing. Phoenix has provided the missing piece: perchlorate. The perchlorate discovery by Phoenix was one of the most important results from Mars since Viking.” Perchlorate, an ion of chlorine and oxygen, becomes a strong oxidant when heated. “

<|begin_of_text|>The United States Transportation Security Administration has recently come under scrutiny for, among other things, its use of X-ray full-body scanners in airports to see through clothes and to detect non-metallic explosives. But are they safe? A group of UC-San Francisco professors recently raised a number of safety concerns regarding these scanners. While the Obama administration attempted to address these worries, its assertion that the scanners are safe appears to fall short.

The TSA has slowly been implementing the use of X-ray scanners in airports (so far, 38 airports have 206 of the machines) in order to see through passengers' clothes and check them for explosive devices. Officials have asserted that the machines are okay to use on the basis of the everyday use of X-rays in medical offices. However, a group of four UCSF professors pinpointed several important differences between the medical X-ray machines and those used in airports. They described the issues in a letter to Dr. John P. Holdren, the assistant to the president for science and technology.

A normal X-ray image is a familiar sight—depending on the exposure, an X-rayed person typically appears only as a skeleton. This is because the X-rays used in those machines penetrate the skin and can only scatter off of the larger atoms in bones.

Unlike a medical X-ray, the TSA X-ray machines are a sci-fi fan's dream: they are lower-energy beams that can only penetrate clothing and the topmost layers of skin. This provides TSA agents with a view that would expose any explosives concealed by clothing. But according to the UCSF professors, the low-energy rays do a "Compton scatter" off tissue layers just under the skin, rather than the bone, possibly exposing some vital areas and leaving the tissues at risk of mutation.

When an X-ray Compton scatters, it doesn't shift an electron to a higher energy level; instead, it hits the electron hard enough to dislodge it from its atom. The authors note that this process is "likely breaking bonds," which could cause mutations in cells and raise the risk of cancer.

Because the X-rays only make it just under the skin's surface, the total volume of tissue responsible for absorbing the radiation is fairly small. The professors point out that many body parts that are particularly susceptible to cancer are just under the surface, such as breast tissue and testicles. They are also concerned with those over 65, as well as children, being exposed to the X-rays.

The professors pointed to a number of other issues, including the possibility that TSA

Many people who work in fusion power look 50 to 100 years into the future, and we say 'what else can provide a sustainable clean energy source for thousands of years on a large scale,' and fusion's one of the only ways to do that, Mauel says.

When you hear the term nuclear energy, images of Fukushima or Three Mile Island may come to mind. But harnessing nuclear power isn't limited to the reactors that we currently use, which rely on nuclear fission. Energy can also be harnessed from fusion."Nuclear fusion is the energy that powers the sun and stars," Mike Mauel, professor of applied physics at Columbia University, told CBSNews.com. "It takes hydrogen gas, heating up to millions of degrees, and brings the atoms together to release energy and make helium."Instead of splitting an atom's nucleus, like in fission, nuclear fusion is the process of bringing together two atomic nuclei to form a new nucleus. And there is no need for dangerous chemical elements like uranium or plutonium -- easing the fears of nuclear proliferation. Energy derived from fusion is appealing because very few natural resources are required to create fuel.According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), approximately 68 percent of the country's electricity in 2011 was generated by coal, natural gas, petroleum, and oil. The next highest energy source was nuclear energy at about 20 percent. About 13 percent was contributed by renewable sources, like solar, hydropower, wind, geothermal and biomass.A United Nations panel of scientists has reportedly agreed, with near certainty, that humans have a direct influence on climate change. The organization is expected to release its findings in an upcoming annual report."It is extremely likely that human influence on climate caused more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010," says a draft of the report, obtained by the New York Times. "There is high confidence that this has warmed the ocean, melted snow and ice, raised global mean sea level and changed some climate extremes in the second half of the 20th century."For the first time in recorded history, the amount of carbon dioxide in the air could rise to 400 parts per million (ppm) -- it's currently just over 390

(CNN) — The Hubble space telescope peers hundreds, thousands, millions of light years into the universe to study novas, quasars and nebulas.

But weeks ago, it pulled its focus way in close — to just light minutes away — to view a rare and beautiful spectacle at the planet Jupiter.

Three big moons crossed past it at the same time, casting their shadows onto Jupiter’s swirling surface.

From the perspective of people theoretically standing down on Jupiter, it would be like three solar eclipses happening at once, astronomers said.

A photo gift

In the last 15 years, this has happened only twice, the Space Telescope Science Institute said. “The next one will be 2032,” said astronomer Carol Christian.

So, Hubble shot photos rapid fire to capture the rare conjunction in late January. And STScI published them on Thursday, along with a short fast-motion video animation.

There was no great scientific gain in Hubble taking the snaps. The moons and their crossings have been examined plenty and are well known.

“We felt that there are images which have aesthetic value above and beyond their scientific value,” said astronomer Zolt Levy.

It was a gift of beauty to the public.

62 moons, 4 big ones

Jupiter is a sort of mini-solar system inside our solar system.

It’s the largest body after the sun. And like the sun, it comprises a lot of helium and hydrogen gas, but it doesn’t have enough mass to burst into the intense nuclear fusion that makes the sun a fireball, NASA says.

It has many satellites, including 62 moons, and they swarm around the planet with many of them crossing the surface facing Earth constantly.

But only four of them are highly visible standouts. They are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.

Just like Galileo

The four moons are called the Galilean satellites, because Renaissance astronomer Galileo Galilei discovered them in 1610, when he pointed his telescope skyward, forever changing human perception of our place in the cosmos.

Many of today’s hobby telescopes are much stronger than his, so anyone can easily follow in his footsteps and cast the same gaze.

And many did, when the three moons passed, posting their recordings of the triple moon transit on YouTube.

In nature, it forms when meteorites containing graphite strike the Earth. The great heat and stress of the impact transforms the graphite into diamond, but retains graphite's hexagonal crystal lattice. Lonsdaleite was first identified in 1967 from the Canyon Diablo meteorite, where it occurs as microscopic crystals associated with diamond.[4][5]

Hexagonal diamond has also been synthesized in the laboratory (1966 or earlier; published in 1967)[6] by compressing and heating graphite either in a static press or using explosives.[7] It has also been produced by chemical vapor deposition,[8][9][10] and also by the thermal decomposition of a polymer, poly(hydridocarbyne), at atmospheric pressure, under argon atmosphere, at 1,000 °C (1,832 °F).[11][12]

It is translucent, brownish-yellow, and has an index of refraction of 2.40 to 2.41 and a specific gravity of 3.2 to 3.3. Its hardness is theoretically superior to that of cubic diamond (up to 58% more), according to computational simulations, but natural specimens exhibited somewhat lower hardness through a large range of values (from 7 to 8 on Mohs hardness scale). The cause is speculated as being due to the samples having been riddled with lattice defects and impurities.[13]

The property of lonsdaleite as a discrete material has been questioned, since specimens under crystallographic inspection showed not a bulk hexagonal lattice, but instead cubic diamond dominated by structural defects that include hexagonal sequences.[14] A quantitative analysis of the X-ray diffraction data of lonsdaleite has shown that about equal amounts of hexagonal and cubic stacking sequences are present. Consequently, it has been suggested that "stacking disordered diamond" is the most accurate structural description of lonsdaleite.[15] On the other hand, recent shock experiments with in situ X-ray diffraction show strong evidence for creation of relatively pure lonsdaleite in dynamic high-pressure environments such as meteorite impacts.[16][17]<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Americium-241 (241Am) is an isotope of americium. Like all isotopes of americium, it is radioactive. 241Am is the most common isotope of americium. It is the most prevalent isotope of americium in nuclear waste. Americium-241 has a half-life of 432.2 years. It is commonly found in ionization type smoke detectors. It is a potential fuel for long-lifetime radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). Its common parent nuclides are β− from 241Pu, EC from 241Cm and α from 245Bk. 241Am is fissile and the critical mass of a bare sphere is 57.6-75.6 kilograms and a sphere diameter of 19–21 centimeters.[1] Americium-241 has a specific activity of 3.43 Ci/g (curies per gram or 126.9 gigabequerels (GBq) per gram).[2] It is commonly found in the form of americium-241 dioxide (241AmO 2 ). This isotope also has one meta state; 241mAm, with an excitation energy of 2.2 MeV, and a half-life of 1.23 μs. The presence of americium-241 in plutonium is determined by the original concentration of plutonium-241 and the sample age. Because of the low penetration of alpha radiation, americium-241 only poses a health risk when ingested or inhaled. Older samples of plutonium containing plutonium-241 contain a buildup of 241Am. A chemical removal of americium-241 from reworked plutonium (e.g. during reworking of plutonium pits) may be required in some cases.

Nucleosynthesis [ edit ]

Americium-241 has been produced in small quantities in nuclear reactors for decades, and many kilograms of 241Am have been accumulated by now.[3] Nevertheless, since it was first offered for sale in 1962, its price, about US$1,500 per gram of 241Am, remains almost unchanged owing to the very complex separation procedure.[4]

Americium-241 is not synthesized directly from uranium – the most common reactor material – but from the plutonium isotope 239Pu. The latter needs to be produced first, according to the following nuclear process:

<|begin_of_text|>Microwaving is a simple, convenient cooking option for people on the go. The microwave oven has been a mainstay in the US for 30+ years, virtually transforming society and how we view food. But despite its wonders, the question that’s been avoided remains: are microwaves the healthiest cooking option? The answer is, of course, no, as there are much better options available that will ensure nutrients will remain in your food.

How Does Microwaving Work?

Before we dive into the research on the possible effects and safety of microwave ovens, let’s clarify what a microwave is. A microwave is a form of non-ionizing radiation. As a matter of contrast, ionizing radiation changes the electromagnetic nature of atoms, or ionizes them. This alters the way they interact with other atoms and molecules around them. X-rays, gamma radiation, and nuclear medicine (CT scans, barium swallows, and mammograms) are types of ionizing radiation. Your food is being zapped by high-frequency waves of heat, and some people argue that this radiation can be harmful to your health.

One study by Dr. Hans Hertel explored how microwaves change the molecular structure of food and the effects of that food on the human body. In his study, he found that individuals who consumed the microwaved foods experienced a decrease in HDL cholesterol, a reduced red blood cell count, and fewer white blood cells. Unfortunately, no studies have been conducted since to replicate Dr. Hertel's findings, so it would be reaching to conclude that microwaving does indeed deteriorate health. Still, there are other cooking options that may be far better at retaining the nutritive quality of food.

The Best Cooking Options for Maintaining Nutrition

Microwaving cooks the food at very high temperatures in a very short amount of time. This results in a great deal of nutrient loss for most foods, especially vegetables. Our foods are also subjected to nutrient loss when we boil, fry, or roast our food. Boiling vegetables, for example, leeches most of the nutrients (including antioxidants) into the water. The best option for cooking vegetables that will result in only a minor loss of nutrients is steaming. Sautéing and baking at low temperatures is also a viable option that will retain more nutrients than microwaving, boiling, or frying. Of course, by making the majority of your diet raw, with some added dietary fat to help absorb the fat-soluble vitamins (A, D,

<|begin_of_text|>The brain - awake and sleeping - is awash in electrical activity, and not just from the individual pings of single neurons communicating with each other. In fact, the brain is enveloped in countless overlapping electric fields, generated by the neural circuits of scores of communicating neurons. The fields were once thought to be an "epiphenomenon, a 'bug' of sorts, occurring during neural communication," says neuroscientist Costas Anastassiou, a postdoctoral scholar in biology at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).

New work by Anastassiou and his colleagues, however, suggests that the fields do much more - and that they may, in fact, represent an additional form of neural communication.

"In other words," says Anastassiou, the lead author of a paper about the work appearing in the journal Nature Neuroscience, "while active neurons give rise to extracellular fields, the same fields feed back to the neurons and alter their behavior," even though the neurons are not physically connected - a phenomenon known as ephaptic coupling. "So far, neural communication has been thought to occur at localized machines, termed synapses. Our work suggests an additional means of neural communication through the extracellular space independent of synapses."

Extracellular electric fields exist throughout the living brain, though they are particularly strong and robustly repetitive in specific brain regions such as the hippocampus, which is involved in memory formation, and the neocortex, the area where long-term memories are held. "The perpetual fluctuations of these extracellular fields are the hallmark of the living and behaving brain in all organisms, and their absence is a strong indicator of a deeply comatose, or even dead, brain," Anastassiou explains.

Previously, neurobiologists assumed that the fields were capable of affecting - and even controlling - neural activity only during severe pathological conditions such as epileptic seizures, which induce very strong fields. Few studies, however, had actually assessed the impact of far weaker - but very common - non-epileptic fields. "The reason is simple," Anastassiou says. "It is very hard to conduct an in vivo experiment in the absence of extracellular fields," to observe what changes when the fields are not around.

To tease out those effects, Anastassiou and his colleagues, including Caltech neuroscientist Christof Koch, the Lois and Victor Troendle Professor of Cognitive and Behavioral Biology and professor of computation and neural systems, focused on strong but slowly oscillating fields, called local field potentials (L

Two huge galaxies were observed in the blob's core, and they're surrounded by a swarm of smaller galaxies in what appears to be the birth of a massive cluster of galaxies.

Astronomers spotted the blob's central galaxies using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Very Large Telescope at the European Southern Observatory in Chile. The glowing space blob was first discovered in 2000, and the source of its light has been a mystery ever since. Scientists created this video to zoom in on the space blob and reveal its inner galaxies.

One study published in 2011 suggested that polarized light emitted by the blob could have come from hidden galaxies. The new observations with ALMA and VLT allowed researchers to pinpoint two big galaxies as the sources of this light. [See Amazing Photos of the Very Large Telescope]

Further observations by the Hubble Space Telescope and the Keck Observatory in Hawaii revealed the swarm of small, faint galaxies surrounding the bigger two in the heart of the blob. Here, galaxies are forming stars at 100 times the rate of the Milky Way.

A giant green "space blob" - called the Lyman-alpha blob LAB-1 - is seen in this composite of two different images taken by the Very Large Telescope in Chile. The LAB-1 space blob is 300,000 light-years across, making it one of the largest known single objects in the universe. Credit: ESO/M. Hayes

"For a long time, the origin of the extended Lyman-alpha light has been controversial," Jim Geach, the study's lead author, said in a statement. "But with the combination of new observations and cutting-edge simulations, we think we have solved a 15-year-old mystery."

So-called "Lyman-alpha blobs" are some of the biggest things in space. This particular space blob, named SSA22-Lyman-alpha Blob 1 (LAB-1), is the largest of its kind. It measures about 300,000 light-years across, or three times the size of the Milky Way galaxy.

LAB-1 is located 11.5 billion light-years from Earth, so the light we observe from it is almost as old as the universe (13.8 billion years). This means that looking at LAB-1 provides a window into the early history of the universe.

All Android apps are deployed and contained in so called APK files. APK files are really just ZIP archives that contain a few mandatory folders and metadata files in addition to the application binary and application resource files such as images, XML layout files, arbitrary binary data, etc.

Good And Folly

APK files are a good medium for distributing Android apps as they cram the myriad pieces of an app into one convenient archive which is easy to copy and distribute. The APK folly is that installed apps are never extracted from the archive and placed in a simple folder. Instead they are kept in the archive.

Why

Ok, so you ask why is keeping installed apps in APK files an incredibly foolish design choice? Simply, because it requires all code that accesses a resource file to deal specially with the APK file format.

This may not seem like much of an issue since the SDK provides a couple of mechanisms to use and access resources. Nearly all classes that use resource files accept resource IDs defined in the auto-generated R.java file and the SDK takes care of loading the resources for you. Even better, there is the Resources class for accessing resources directly by obtaining InputStream instances to them and even AssetFileDescriptors for them.

These mechanism don’t really solve the problem. In the first instance, the SDK is simply hiding the underlying problem by accepting the resource IDs and accessing the APK file behind the scenes. Obviously, the SDK still has special code to extract resources from the APK file. Special code that exists only for specific file types (images, XML layouts, etc.) explicitly handled by the SDK in this way.

The second instance is not really a solution, it is a manifestation of the problem. The resource files are buried in the APK file and we need the Resources class to access them. All the standard methods of opening a file, in Java or native C, are useless. You can’t use new FileInputStream() in Java or open() a file in C. We need special code that is aware of the APK format and uses the designated APIs to extract files from it.

At least in theory. In practice the Resources class does not provide a real solution for accessing APK resource files from C. There is an extremely convoluted method of obtaining the APK’s file descriptor in Java from an undocumented member of an AssetFileDescriptor instance, obtaining the offset and length of the resource in the APK file and passing the triplet through JNI. You can read about it here. The alternative is to compile your native code with libzip support and to process the APK file yourself

But this is actually real. Two years ago, researchers discovered a strange electro-chemical signature in the sludge at the bottom of Aarhus Bay in Denmark. Now, they've discovered what was causing it: a vast network of bacteria that form electrical connections with each other, almost like nerve cells in the brain.

Above, you can see what you might call tiny electrical wires that connect each bacterial cell, under an electron microscope. The wires are blue, and they are running through a piece of sediment, or sand from the seafloor.

Over at Wired Science, Brandon Keim explains:

The bacteria were first detected in 2010 by researchers perplexed at chemical fluctuations in sediments from the bottom of Aarhus Bay... Almost instantaneously linking changing oxygen levels in water with reactions in mud nearly an inch below, the fluctuations occurred too fast to be explained by chemistry. Only an electrical signal made sense — but no known bacteria could transmit electricity across such comparatively vast distances. Were bacteria the size of humans, the signals would be making a journey 12 miles long. Now the mysterious bacteria have been identified. They belong to a microbial family called Desulfobulbaceae, though they share just 92 percent of their genes with any previously known member of that family. They deserve to be considered a new genus, the study of which could open a new scientific frontier for understanding the interface of biology, geology and chemistry across the undersea world.

Even more incredible, it turns out these bacteria are found all over the world, their tiny electrical cables woven deeply into the mud of the ocean bottom. Keim writes that the scientists found "a full half-mile of Desulfobulbacea cable" in one teaspoonful of mud.

In other words, the entire ocean bed may be electrified in the same way our nervous systems are. They're networks of individual cells connected by electro-chemical signals — essentially they are an enormous multi-cellular organism. These bacteria "breathe" by absorbing oxygen and hydrogen sulfide, emitting water as a byproduct. They might be serving as a vast water purification system on the ocean bottom, or they might be part of a geological process that's a lot more complex. We also have no way of knowing how other sea creatures are interacting with this giant electrical grid organism.

by Staff Writers

Cleveland OH (SPX) May 29, 2013

Entanglement is a property in quantum mechanics that seemed so unbelievable and so lacking in detail that, 66 years ago this spring, Einstein called it "spooky action at a distance."

But a mathematician at Case Western Reserve University and two of his recent PhD graduates show entanglement is actually prevalent in large quantum systems and have identified the threshold at which it occurs.

The finding holds promise for the ongoing push to understand and take advantage of the property. If harnessed, entanglement could yield super high-speed communications, hack-proof encryptions and quantum computers so fast and powerful they would make today's supercomputers look like adding machines in comparison.

The mathematicians don't tell us how entanglement works, but were able to put parameters on the property by combining math concepts developed for a number of different applications during the last five decades. In a nutshell, the researchers connected the math to properties of quantum mechanics-the otherworldly rules that best apply to atomic and subatomic particles-to describe physical reality.

"There have been indications that large subgroups within quantum systems are entangled," said Stanislaw Szarek, mathematics professor at Case Western Reserve and an author of the study. "Our contribution is to find out exactly when entanglement becomes ubiquitous."

Szarek worked with Guillaume Aubrun, assistant professor of mathematics at Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, France, and Deping Ye, assistant professor of mathematics and statistics at Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada. Their work is published online in the Early View section of Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics.

The behaviors of materials down at the level of atoms are often strange, but entanglement borders on our concepts of sorcery. For example, if two electrons spinning in opposite directions are entangled, when one changes direction, the other immediately changes, whether the electrons are side by side, across the room or at opposite ends of the universe.

Other particles, such as photons, atoms and molecules, can also become entangled, but taking advantage of the property requires more than a pair or handful.

Szarek, Aubrun and Ye focused on large quantum systems-large groups of particles that have the potential for use in our world.

They found that, in systems in a random state, two subsystems that are each less than one-fifth of the whole are generally not entangled. Two

The first modern unified state in German history was the German Empire, founded in 1871 by Wilhelm I, King of Prussia. The country was a member of the Central Powers during World War I alongside Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire. However, as their war effort collapsed in 1918, the empire fell to civil conflicts, resulting in the abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II and the end of the German Empire. The Weimar Republic that succeeded the empire carried the burdens of the war in the years that followed.

Probably one of the most infamous eras of German history was the fascist Nazi regime of the Third Reich or Nazi Germany. In 1933, Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party came to power within the Weimar Republic, and soon seized all power from the democratic Reichstag. In the years that followed, Hitler built an enormous and zealous army and annexed neighboring countries, including Austria and Czechoslovakia. On September 1, 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland, prompting a declaration of war from France and the United Kingdom, sparking World War II.

The spacecraft, known as Prospector-1, would study the yet-to-be-selected asteroid to determine the value of its resources for mining. It’ll also put Deep Space Industries’ water-based propulsion system to an interplanetary test.

“Deep Space Industries has worked diligently to get to this point, and now we can say with confidence that we have the right technology, the right team and the right plan to execute this historic mission,” Rick Tumlinson, DSI’s board chairman and co-founder, said in a news release.

California-based DSI and its partners in Luxembourg say they’ll launch a precursor satellite called Prospector-X into low Earth orbit next year to test the technologies that would be used for Prospector-1.

DSI sees near-Earth asteroids as potentially valuable sources for materials ranging from plain old water ice – which can be processed into breathable oxygen and drinkable water as well as propellant – to in-space building materials and precious metals.

If DSI sticks to its schedule, Prospector-1 could become the first commercial asteroid mining exploration mission. However, Planetary Resources, which is based in Redmond, Wash., is also taking aim at asteroids.

Planetary Resources had its first precursor spacecraft, Arkyd-3R, deployed into orbit for a five-month test mission last year. A larger spacecraft, the Arkyd-6A, is being readied for launch later this year and will observe Earth in infrared wavelengths as a practice round for asteroid prospecting.

Planetary Resources says its next-generation space telescopes, known as the Arkyd 100 and Arkyd 200, could start studying the composition of near-Earth asteroids in the 2017-2019 time frame. At the same time, the company plans to create a constellation of Earth-observing satellites known as Ceres.

If suitable targets are identified, Planetary Resources could begin extracting materials from asteroids by the mid-2020s, according to the company’s president and CEO, Chris Lewicki.

Planetary Resources has raised tens of millions of dollars since its founding in 2012. Deep Space Industries was founded a year later, and has raised an undisclosed amount of seed money from investors including Metatron Global.

Lisdexamfetamine (contracted from L -lysine-dextroamphetamine), sold under the brand name Vyvanse amongst others, is a substituted amphetamine and an inactive prodrug of the central nervous system (CNS) stimulant dextroamphetamine that is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and binge eating disorder.[6][7] Its chemical structure consists of dextroamphetamine coupled with the essential amino acid L -lysine. Lisdexamfetamine itself is inactive prior to its absorption and the subsequent rate-limited enzymatic cleavage of the molecule's L -lysine portion, which produces the active metabolite (dextroamphetamine).

Lisdexamfetamine can be prescribed for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults and children six and older, as well as for moderate to severe binge eating disorder in adults.[6] The safety and the efficacy of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in children with ADHD three to five years old have not been established.[8]

Did you know caffeine is the world’s most favourite and most consumed drug? Caffeine is derived from seeds, leaves, and nuts from several plants. This includes the Coffea plant, whose seeds are harvested to produce coffee.

In its purest state, caffeine appears as white crystal granules. But unlike other drugs, the use of caffeine goes unregulated since it is safe for regular consumption.

How Caffeine Works

As soon as you wake up, adenosine levels start to build up, which cause mental and physical weariness. By drinking a cup of freshly brewed coffee, you can combat drowsiness, sharpen mental performance, and maximize your energy levels.

As when you consume coffee, the caffeine in it gets broken down into smaller compounds, which are transported into the bloodstream.

The caffeine in coffee then works by minimizing the effects of adenosine, which is a neurotransmitter. Caffeine helps connect adenosine receptors within your brains without triggering them.

List of Foods Containing Caffeine

Caffeine is derived from cocoa seeds, coffee beans, and kola nuts. Hence, any product that has any of the three surely has caffeine. This includes the following foods:

1. Chocolate

If you want an instant energy boost, not to mention a mood lifter, munch some chocolate. Chocolate is derived from cocoa beans; hence, it is no surprise as to why it is listed as the number 1 caffeinated food.

A plain 162 g. chocolate bar alone can supply roughly 70 mg. of caffeine. However, the caffeine content of each chocolate bar or candy varies according to its formula. To ensure your chocolate bar packs enough caffeine, choose dark chocolate.

2. Chocolate mousse

A few scoops of chocolate mousse or pudding supplies roughly 10 mg. of caffeine, which is enough to keep you awake to do your homework.

3. Ice cream and smoothies

A coffee-flavoured smoothie or ice cream packs 125 mg. of caffeine per serving. Even frozen desserts in mocha varieties can supply 45 mg. of caffeine per cup.

4. Coffee and chocolate-flavoured snacks

Chocolate chip cookies, cereals, and any other snack that is coffee or chocolate-flavoured contain a small amount of caffeine. This includes Quaker’s Cocoa Blasts, which supply 11 mg of caffeine per serving

He is noted for his discovery of hydrogen, which he termed "inflammable air".[1] He described the density of inflammable air, which formed water on combustion, in a 1766 paper, On Factitious Airs. Antoine Lavoisier later reproduced Cavendish's experiment and gave the element its name.

A notoriously shy man (it has been postulated that he had what is now called childhood autism in the ICD-10),[2] Cavendish was nonetheless distinguished for great accuracy and precision in his researches into the composition of atmospheric air, the properties of different gases, the synthesis of water, the law governing electrical attraction and repulsion, a mechanical theory of heat, and calculations of the density (and hence the mass) of the Earth. His experiment to measure the density of the Earth has come to be known as the Cavendish experiment.

Biography [ edit ]

Early life [ edit ]

Henry Cavendish was born on 10 October 1731 in Nice, where his family was living at the time. His mother was Lady Anne de Grey, fourth daughter of Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Kent, and his father was Lord Charles Cavendish, the third son of William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire. The family traced its lineage across eight centuries to Norman times, and was closely connected to many aristocratic families of Great Britain. Henry's mother died in 1733, three months after the birth of her second son, Frederick, and shortly before Henry's second birthday, leaving Lord Charles Cavendish to bring up his two sons.

From the age of 11 Henry attended Newcome's School, a private school near London. At the age of 18 (on 24 November 1748) he entered the University of Cambridge in St Peter's College, now known as Peterhouse, but left three years later on 23 February 1751 without taking a degree (at the time, a common practice).[3][4] He then lived with his father in London, where he soon had his own laboratory.

<|begin_of_text|>Supply and demand is perhaps one of the most fundamental concepts of economics and it is the backbone of a market economy. Demand refers to how much (quantity) of a product or service is desired by buyers. The quantity demanded is the amount of a product people are willing to buy at a certain price; the relationship between price and quantity demanded is known as the demand relationship. Supply represents how much the market can offer. The quantity supplied refers to the amount of a certain good producers are willing to supply when receiving a certain price. The correlation between price and how much of a good or service is supplied to the market is known as the supply relationship. Price, therefore, is a reflection of supply and demand.

The relationship between demand and supply underlie the forces behind the allocation of resources. In market economy theories, demand and supply theory will allocate resources in the most efficient way possible. How? Let us take a closer look at the law of demand and the law of supply.

A. The Law of Demand

The law of demand states that, if all other factors remain equal, the higher the price of a good, the less people will demand that good. In other words, the higher the price, the lower the quantity demanded. The amount of a good that buyers purchase at a higher price is less because as the price of a good goes up, so does the opportunity cost of buying that good. As a result, people will naturally avoid buying a product that will force them to forgo the consumption of something else they value more. The chart below shows that the curve is a downward slope.

A, B and C are points on the demand curve. Each point on the curve reflects a direct correlation between quantity demanded (Q) and price (P). So, at point A, the quantity demanded will be Q1 and the price will be P1, and so on. The demand relationship curve illustrates the negative relationship between price and quantity demanded. The higher the price of a good the lower the quantity demanded (A), and the lower the price, the more the good will be in demand (C).

B. The Law of Supply

Like the law of demand, the law of supply demonstrates the quantities that will be sold at a certain price. But unlike the law of demand, the supply relationship shows an upward slope. This means that the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied. Producers supply more at a higher price because selling a higher quantity at a higher price increases revenue.

A, B and C are points on the supply

<|begin_of_text|>Pope Francis, in his apostolic exhortation, levied charges against free market capitalism, denying that “economic growth, encouraged by a free market, will inevitably succeed in bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world” and concluding that “this opinion … has never been confirmed by the facts.” He went on to label unfettered capitalism as “a new tyranny.” Let’s look at the pope’s tragic vision.

First, I acknowledge that capitalism fails miserably when compared with heaven or a utopia. Any earthly system is going to come up short in such a comparison. However, mankind must make choices among alternative economic systems that actually exist on earth. For the common man, capitalism is superior to any system yet devised to deal with his everyday needs and desires.

Capitalism is relatively new in human history. Prior to capitalism, the way people amassed great wealth was by looting, plundering and enslaving their fellow man. With the rise of capitalism, it became possible to amass great wealth by serving and pleasing your fellow man. Capitalists seek to discover what people want and produce and market it as efficiently as possible as a means to profit. A couple of examples would be J.D. Rockefeller, whose successful marketing drove kerosene prices down from 58 cents a gallon in 1865 to 7 cents in 1900. Henry Ford became rich by producing cars for the common man. Both Ford’s and Rockefeller’s personal benefits pale in comparison with that received by the common man by having cheaper kerosene and cheaper transportation. There are literally thousands of examples of how mankind’s life has been made better by those in the pursuit of profits. Here’s my question to you: Are people who, by their actions, created unprecedented convenience, longer life expectancy and a more pleasant life for the ordinary person — and became wealthy in the process — deserving of all the scorn and ridicule heaped upon them by intellectuals, politicians and now the pope?

Let’s examine the role of profits but first put it in perspective in terms of magnitude. Between 1960 and 2012, after-tax corporate profit averaged a bit over 6 percent of the gross domestic product, while wages averaged 47 percent of the GDP. Far more important than simple statistics about the magnitude of profits is its role in guiding resources to their highest-valued uses and satisfying people. Try polling people with a few questions. Ask them what services they are more satisfied with and what they are less satisfied with. On the “more satisfied” list would be

Wikipedia was founded in 2001 as a project to build an online, free-access, free-content encyclopedia entirely from scratch. Since then, it has grown to be the largest encyclopedia ever created, comprising more than five million articles in English, while still relying on the contributions of volunteers. The English Wikipedia community thanks the millions of users whose edits over the past fourteen-plus years have made this remarkable accomplishment possible.

A brief history

Wikipedia officially launched on 15 January 2001, with Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger as its leaders, on a single computer server as the successor to Nupedia. Its first major mainstream media coverage was in The New York Times on 20 September 2001. In the first year of its existence, more than 20,000 encyclopedia entries were created – a rate exceeding 1,500 articles per month. Today, there are Wikipedia editions in more than 200 languages, accompanied by a dozen additional free-content projects, such as Wikimedia Commons. In March 2006, the English Wikipedia reached one million articles. According to Alexa, Wikipedia is currently the world's sixth most popular website, receiving approximately eight billion pageviews per month. We reached five million articles on 1 November 2015.

A work in progress

While Wikipedia is an incredible success, it remains a work in progress. There are still great gaps in its coverage with millions of important topics missing from its pages. Many articles – even vital ones – are not yet considered high-quality. Of our 5,810,435 articles, only a few tens of thousands have passed a vetting process for good or featured status, and more than half are short stubs or start-class articles. There are also more than 200 non-English-language editions of Wikipedia that need volunteers. In other words, there is still much work to be done – and you can help!

<|begin_of_text|>Thanks to data collected by ESA’s Cluster spacecraft and a NASA mission called the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE), scientists have solved a long-standing space mystery – the origin of a colorful display in the night sky known as the theta aurora.

Auroras are the most visible manifestation of the Sun’s effect on Earth.

They are caused by the solar wind, a stream of plasma – electrically charged atomic particles – carrying its own magnetic field, interacting with the magnetic field of our planet.

Normally, the main region for this impressive display is the ‘auroral oval’, which lies at around 65-70 degrees north or south of the equator, encircling the polar caps.

However, auroras can occur at even higher latitudes. One type is known as a theta aurora because seen from above it looks like the Greek letter Θ (theta) – an oval with a line crossing through the center.

While the genesis of the auroral oval emissions is reasonably well understood, the origin of the theta aurora was unclear until now.

The new study, published in the journal Science, shows that hot plasma funneled into near-Earth space from the Sun helps cause these unique aurora.

“Previously it was unclear whether this hot plasma was a result of direct solar wind entry through the lobes of the magnetosphere, or if the plasma is somehow related to the plasma sheet on the night side of Earth,” said study lead author Dr Robert Fear of the University of Southampton.

“The possibilities have been debated since the first satellite observations of the phenomenon were made in the 1980s.”

The mystery was finally solved by studying data collected simultaneously by the IMAGE satellite and Cluster’s PEACE electron spectrometer instruments on September 15, 2005.

While the four Cluster satellites were located in the southern hemisphere magnetic lobe, IMAGE had a wide-field view of the southern hemisphere aurora.

As one Cluster satellite observed uncharacteristically energetic plasma in the lobe, IMAGE saw the ‘arc’ of the theta aurora cross the magnetic footprint of Cluster.

“We found that the energetic plasma signatures occur on high-latitude magnetic field lines that have been closed by the process of magnetic reconnection, which then causes the plasma to become relatively hot,” Dr Fear explained.

“Because the field lines are closed, the observations are incompatible with direct entry from the solar wind.”

“By testing this and other predictions about the behavior of the theta aurora, our observations provide strong evidence that the plasma trapping mechanism is responsible for

Motorized molecules driven by light have been used to drill holes in the membranes of individual cells and show promise for either bringing therapeutic agents into the cells or directly inducing the cells to die.

Researchers at Rice, Durham (U.K.) and North Carolina State universities demonstrated in lab tests how rotors in single-molecule nanomachines can be activated by ultraviolet light to spin at 2 to 3 million rotations per second and open membranes in cells.

The researchers used motors based on work by Nobel laureate Bernard Feringa, who won the prize for chemistry in 2016. The motor itself is a paddle-like chain of atoms that can be prompted to move in a single direction when supplied with energy. Properly mounted as part of the cell-targeting molecule, the motor can be made to spin when activated by a light source.

The work detailed this week in Nature was led by chemists James Tour of Rice, Robert Pal of Durham and Gufeng Wang of North Carolina State. Their labs collaborated to create several motorized molecules that can home in on specific cells, and they viewed what happens when they activate the motors with light.

The Tour lab previously demonstrated molecular motors whose diffusion in a solution was enhanced, if not specifically directed, when activated by ultraviolet light. The rotors needed to spin between 2 and 3 megahertz – 2 to 3 million times per second – to show they could overcome obstacles presented by adjacent molecules and outpace natural Brownian motion.

“We thought it might be possible to attach these nanomachines to the cell membrane and then turn them on to see what happened,” Tour said. The motors, only about a nanometer wide, can be designed to target and then either tunnel through a cell’s lipid bilayer membrane to deliver drugs or other payloads or disrupt the 8-10 nanometer-wide membrane, thereby killing the cell. They can also be functionalized for solubility and for fluorescent tracking, he said.

“These nanomachines are so small that we could park 50,000 of them across the diameter of a human hair, yet they have the targeting and actuating components combined in that diminutive package to make molecular machines a reality for treating disease,” Tour said.

The Rice lab created 10 variants, including motor-bearing molecules in several sizes and peptide-carrying nanomachines designed to target specific cells for death, as well as control molecules identical to the other nanomachines but without motors

<|begin_of_text|>A brief mention today of a new measurement from the BABAR experimental collaboration, which tests lepton universality (to be explained below) and finds it wanting.

The Basic Story (Slightly Oversimplified)

Within the Standard Model of particle physics (the equations that describe and predict the behavior of all of the known particles and forces), the effects of the weak nuclear force on the three leptons — the electron, the muon and the tau — are all expected to be identical. This called “lepton universality”. This expectation has been tested many times; for instance, the probability that a negatively charged W particle decays to an electron plus an electron anti-neutrino is the same as for it to decay to a muon plus a muon anti-neutrino, and the same for a tau plus a tau anti-neutrino, to very good precision.

Another place (see Figure 1) to test “lepton universality” is in the decay of a hadron containing a bottom quark to a hadron containing a charm quark plus a lepton plus a corresponding anti-neutrino. (Specifically, the focus here is on hadrons called “mesons” which contain a bottom quark or charm quark, an up or down anti-quark,and, as for all hadrons, lots of gluons and quark-antiquark pairs.)

These decays occur via the weak nuclear force (more precisely, through the effect of a W “virtual particle” [which is not really a particle at all, but a more generalized disturbance in the W field]) so the probability for such a decay in which a tau is produced should be related to the probability for the case where a muon or electron is produced. The meson with a bottom quark is called a B, the meson with a charm quark is called a D, so for shorthand the decays to the three leptons and their corresponding anti-neutrinos are called B → D e ν, B → D μ ν and B → D τ ν.

However, testing lepton universality in this particular context is a little tricky, because the masses of the three leptons are different — because their interactions with the Higgs field are not universal — and in this class of decays, the difference matters. Whereas a W particle has a mass of 80 GeV/c2, so big that the tau lepton’s 1.8 GeV/c2 mass is too small to play any role in the W

One of the earliest shooting games, Space Invaders was released by Taito in Japan on June 19, 1978. Gameplay involves attempting to defeat waves of aliens cascading down from the top of the screen with a laser cannon that moves along a fixed horizontal axis. The only goal is to earn as many points as possible. Designer Tomohiro Nishikado was in charge of planning, graphic design, and programming for the game and drew creative inspiration from such diverse sources as Gun Fight, Breakout, The War of the Worlds, and Star Wars. The game’s development cycle lasted for one year, during which Nishikado created custom hardware and software. The game achieved massive popularity upon its release (leading to a temporary shortage of one hundred yen coins in Japan), and helped usher in the golden age of arcade video games (circa 1978-1984).

Space Invaders sold over 400,000 arcade cabinets worldwide and grossed around $3.8 billion in revenue by 1982, equivalent to over $13 billion in 2014, making it the highest-grossing video game of all time.

Gameplay

Arcade (cabaret/cocktail) version

Gameplay in Space Invaders is relatively simple. The player controls a small ship that can only move laterally across the bottom of the screen and fires vertically. Five rows of eleven aliens each advance slowly from one side of the screen to the other, dropping down one space and reversing direction when they reach either side. The player’s task is to acquire points by eliminating enemies and to destroy all of the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen and complete their “invasion.” As aliens are destroyed, the speed of the remaining enemies increases, as does the tempo of the music. Once all of the enemies are destroyed, the wave resets and the difficulty increases (a cycle that can continue indefinitely).

The Invaders constantly shoot back at the player as they advance from side to side across the screen. To help avoid their attacks, the player can hide behind a number of destructible barriers or “bunkers” near the bottom of the screen (four in the original version). Occasionally a “mystery ship” will appear near the top of the screen and move quickly from one side to the other while making a distinctive klaxon noise. Destroying it rewards the player with a sizeable point bonus.

Go here to find the largest selection of Blue lagoon tours in Iceland The Lagoon is just a fifteen-minute drive from Keflavík International Airport, or a thirty-minute drive from Reykjavík, located between the two. It is thus often visited straight after arrival to the country or right before departure. There are few better ways to recharge after a long-flight or action-packed holiday. History The Blue Lagoon started as a pool of wastewater from the Svartsengi geothermal plant in 1976. The first person to bathe there was Valur Margeirsson in 1981. He was met with some resistance prior to taking the first dip as people thought he was mad for wanting to bath in a "blue mud pool". He and others soon began to notice the unusual but remarkable healing qualities of the azure waters. Those with conditions such as psoriasis found the waters immediately soothing for their condition. News quickly spread, and by 1987, the first swimming facilities were officially opened. Since then, the establishment has only grown, from an open pool with no surrounding buildings to a luxurious spa, research centre and hotel. Today The Blue Lagoon is considered to have such notable regenerative qualities because the water is rich in silica and sulphur. A research and development facility on site finds cures and remedies for skin ailments, and silica mud is available for free on the sides of the pool for guests to enjoy a facemask. The temperature in the bathing and swimming area is very comfortable, averaging 37–39° C (98–102° F). The Blue Lagoon also boasts the LAVA Restaurant, the Blue Café and the Lagoon Spa: you can thus enjoy cocktails, health products, delicious meals and treatments such as massages without leaving the premises. Saunas, steam rooms and a small waterfall are also on site. For all of these reasons and more, the Blue Lagoon is considered to be one of the most enjoyable and romantic spots in the country. It is surrounded by a plethora of fantastic volcanic landscapes, and the water itself is opaque and vividly blue. Rising pillars of steam only add to the spa’s fantastic ambience.

<|begin_of_text|>Introduction

The hydrogen atom is unique since physical theories can be applied to it “without” approximations. Any discrepancy between theoretical prediction and experimental measurement which may be unveiled at any increase of theoretical and experimental accuracy thus holds the potential for new fundamental insights.

Nothing can hide in hydrogen, not even the proton at its center. In fact, measurements with hydrogen beams by Stern in 1933 revealed that the magnetic moment of the proton deviated from the prediction of the Dirac relativistic theory. This was the first indication that the proton - contrary to the electron - has a structure. In 1947 measurements of the 2S-2P (Lamb shift) and 1S-hyperfine splitting in hydrogen deviated from those predicted by the Dirac equation. This was the initiation for the development of quantum electrodynamics (QED). In the last four decades, the goal to measure hydrogen energy levels with greater accuracy has lead to advances in high resolution spectroscopy and metrology. This peaked with the invention of the frequency comb laser by Hänsch in the late 90ies. The high accuracy obtained with such techniques provided cornerstones to test bound-state QED, to determine the Rydberg constant and the proton radius (assuming the correctness of the theory), and to search for slow time variations of fundamental constants.

Hydrogen energy levels are slightly modified by the fact that in contrast to the electron the proton has a size. Hence, to precisely predict these energy levels an accurate knowledge of the root-mean-square charge radius of the proton is necessary. The historical method of determining the proton radius was based upon scattering electrons on protons, in effect by scattering an electron beam on a liquid hydrogen target. The uncertainty related to the knowledge of the proton radius extracted from electron-proton scattering limited the prediction accuracy of the hydrogen energy levels, and consequently it was limiting the comparison between theory and measurements. Therefore to advance the check (comparison between prediction and measurement) of bound-state QED describing the hydrogen energy levels it was necessary to have a more precise determination of the proton radius. This was one of the main motivations for our experiment: to measure the 2S-2P energy difference in muonic hydrogen (µp), an exotic atom composed by a negative muon and a proton. The single electron of a hydrogen atom is replaced by a negative muon which has a lifetime of only 2 microseconds and is 200 times heavier than the electron. According to the laws of quantum mechanics the muon wave functions in S-states overlap

By Charles Q. Choi

LiveScience

A pocket of water some 2.6 billion years old — the most ancient pocket of water known by far, older even than the dawn of multicellular life — has now been discovered in a mine 2 miles below the Earth's surface.

The finding, announced in the May 16 issue of the journal Nature, raises the tantalizing possibility that ancient life might be found deep underground not only within Earth, but in similar oases that may exist on Mars, the scientists who studied the water said.

Geoscientist Barbara Sherwood Lollar at the University of Toronto and her colleagues have investigated deep mines across the world since the 1980s. Water can flow into fractures in rocks and become isolated deep in the crust for many years, serving as a time capsule of what their environments were like at the time they were sealed off.

In gold mines in South Africa 1.7 miles (2.8 kilometers) deep, the scientists previously discovered microbes could survive in pockets of waterisolated for tens of millions of years. These reservoirs were many times saltier than seawater, "and had chemistry in many ways similar to hydrothermal vents on the bottom of the ocean, full of dissolved hydrogen and other chemicals capable of supporting life," Sherwood Lollar said. [Strangest Places Where Life Is Found on Earth]

To see what other ancient pockets of water might exist, Sherwood Lollar and her colleagues investigated copper and zinc mines near the city of Timmins in Ontario, Canada. "As the prices of copper, zinc and gold have gone up, mines now go deeper, which has helped our search for long-isolated reservoirs of water hidden underground," Sherwood Lollar said.

'Mind-blowing' find

"Sometimes we went down in cages — they're not called elevators underground — that dropped us to the levels we wanted to go," Sherwood Lollar told OurAmazingPlanet. "Other times, we went down ramp mines, which have curling spiral roadways, so we could actually drive all the way down."

The scientists analyzed water they found 2 miles (2.4 km) deep. They focused on noble gases such as helium, neon, argon and xenon. Past studies analyzing bubbles of

They are monstrous, centuries-old infernos that issue thick billows of ash and smoke, and generate sinkholes that consume roads and homes without warning. Yet in spite of the dangers they pose, underground coal fires are some of the least known environmental disasters. China, the world’s largest miner and consumer of coal, has consistently downplayed the fires in its coalfields, considered the most severe on earth.

In some ways an underground coal fire works the same as a barbeque pit: coal is highly flammable, and stays ignited as long as there is oxygen and coal to burn. If a coalfield has an oxygen source, anything from a cigarette butt to a lightning strike can trigger a fire. Coalfields that have caught flame burn hundreds of feet underground at temperatures exceeding 1000°F for tens, hundreds, even thousands of years, rendering the surrounding area a toxic, eroded wasteland.

The ash and fumes that coal fires spew contain toxins and poisonous gases, including mercury, lead, arsenic carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide, contaminating the air, water, and soil and causing diseases in the area’s residents. Coal fires also pump out carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.

Coal fires can self-ignite, but mining operations, which expose underground coal to oxygen and produce coal dust, create a much greater risk and are responsible for an estimated 75% of coal fires.

“Every country that is coal-producing has coal fires,” says Anupma Prakash, a geologist at the University of Alaska who has conducted extensive research on coal fires. So it comes as no surprise that China, which accounted for 49.5% of last year’s global coal production, also has the world’s worst coal fires. Hundreds of fires proliferate the nearly 3,000-mile coal belt running across north China.

In China, though, the main concern regarding coal fires is not environmental, but economic. “China’s coal fires destroy millions of tons of coal every year,” says Carsten Drebenstedt, a surface mining professor from Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg in Germany who has studied the fires. In fact, the country’s coal fires consume 20 million tons of coal annually and render ten times that amount inaccessible.

The more oxygen-carrying power your blood has, the faster you can run.

Without enough oxygen, your body is quickly plunged into acidosis, the deep burning sensation in your legs that you feel at the end of a race or a hard workout.

That is why keeping your iron levels high enough is critical to running well.

Doing anything that would decrease your body’s oxygen-carrying potential would be crazy right?

Well, maybe not if it can save somebody’s life.

Donating blood is an admirable endeavor—according to the American Red Cross, over 41,000 blood donations are required every day in the United States, and given the short shelf life of whole blood and plasma, there’s a constant need for blood.

Though blood donation is lifesaving, runners are often hesitant to give blood because we wonder will giving blood affect your running?

Today we are going to look at how much does giving blood or plasma affect your running performance.

If you are wondering about running before giving blood, we will explain the pros and cons, and give you some guidelines about blood donation recovery time. Finally, we are going to show you 4 ways to limit the negative effects and explain how to recover from giving blood faster.

Can you run after giving blood? Let’s find out.

Running After Donating Blood

A 2013 study by David Hill, Jakob Vingren, and Samatha Burdette examined the short-term effects of donating blood and plasma on a cycling endurance test in nineteen test subjects.

Each subject underwent a ride to exhaustion on a stationary bike before giving blood or plasma, and again two hours, two days, and seven days after the donation.

The researchers measured both time to exhaustion and maximum oxygen consumption, or VO2 max, during each of the four tests.

Unsurprisingly:

They found that both VO2 max and time to exhaustion were negatively impacted in the immediate aftermath of a whole blood donation.

VO2 max dropped by 15% and time to exhaustion decreased by 19% during the exercise test two hours after a blood donation.

VO2 max was still 10% and 7% lower than pre-donation levels at two and seven days post-donation, respectively.

The results of plasma donation are more interesting:

Although the plasma donation resulted in no change in VO2 max at any point, time to exhaustion was decreased two hours post-donation, but not two days or one week out.
